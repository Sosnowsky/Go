PW[Sosnovsky (2100)]PB[Robin Nilsson (2126)]C[This was the first game of the tournament, against a player who is quite active in the tournaments around Scandinavia. We had played 3 times before. He was the only 1 dan in the tournament apart from me, so in my head I thought that this would be the most important game for me to win.

I know Robin, he invited me for Gotheburg tournament some years ago. :)]

(;W[hc]C[it's of course not important moment of the game, but I believe this move is a bit wrong direction of play

primary we don't want to build from the 3-3 point, so I would prefer to just protect the corner or play keima to the left side
or not play there at all]

I see, let's finish the commentary here then. I checked the game till the end and since you never exploited N5 cut or J2 aji, which is still somehow there, it was no chance to reverse the game anymore. 

Your opponent played solid, but I think you could do better. You have been answering his moves too much by playing too conservative, so he got many key-points by that, like J13. Also you didn't punish enough his mistakes, like R15

The beginning was already not so promising after the top left corner fight. Then it got even worse after the bottom side painful results. However, starting from the top right corner, you launched a good attempt for a turnaround. it's a pity you didn't take the chances to reverse the game, like J2. 

Looking forward to the next games! :)]
