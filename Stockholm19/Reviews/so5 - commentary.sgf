PW[Kim Johansson (2182)]PB[Sosnovsky (2100)]C[This is another active scandinavian player. We played a few times. He has a fame of being very good at the endgame, my last game with him had left me an impression: I took a huge lead in the early middgame, which I thought I would keep unless he tries something complicated. He just played normally and ended up winning by 0.5. Therefore my strategy in this game was to finish by resignation (hopefully his :)).


yeah, this name is very familiar :) I played him in Gothenburg]

yeah, you have a promising position, no need to hurry and this is a solid move]

Besides the left side confusion D13 etc, I really liked your play. Of course white made it easier for you by the overplay E13 and then making the dumpling, but after that you were completely in control and you finished the game with calm movs without a big problem. Just pay a bit more attetion on details, but anyway this was very promising performance, you outplayed your opponent.:)])
