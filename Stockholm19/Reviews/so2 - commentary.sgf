I think the only issue was the top right corner fight, if you want to start fighting so early on, you have to be really precise on timing of the moves. You would not be in an advantage, if the opponent would protect Q11 problem on time. After that you have just been easily keeping your lead. Overall you didn't make any crucial mistake. ])
