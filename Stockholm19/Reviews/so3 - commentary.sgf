PW[Sosnovsky (2100)]PB[Sylvain Praz (2221)]C[The third game of the day is usually a good time to have some complicated fighting, and apparently my opponent agreed on that :)
Apparently, after the first fight the game was good for W. However during the game I didn't know at any time who was ahead (I fell in byo yomi quite early, and I thought that by focusing only on the fight I would had a chance to win).

I see :)]

I really appreciate your fighting spirit and flexibility in this game! You have been ahead most of the game, just be careful about your shapes, those were the biggest problem in this game and fortunately they haven't been punished much. However, overall a great fighting game!]
