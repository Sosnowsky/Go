conclusions

move 24 was first big mistake, white became heavy too early
move 25 black give a chance for white to fix the problem, but after white respond black came back and the result was very good

In upper right corner there were  mistakes from but after move 40 the result was super good for black locally

both players did wait too much for the fight in the lower side, but move 62 was the last tenuki and black did arrive first to catch the fight


black did attack very well and white didn't have any more chance to come back





What was the main mistake for both players is to not consider tenuki enough: you should think to every move pretending not to know which one was the move before ^^ ("please don't be human")


Good game and see you!
