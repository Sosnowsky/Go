(;W[pn]C[I know this is supposed to be a joseki, but I have never seen it before on my online games. I guess I should explore more variations of the two space low pincer if I play it so often...

It's an old move, but usually black is happier, there is not much to explore.]
(;B[mq]
;W[rq]C[A few quick questions:
How is it possible to continue in the lower right corner? (either immediately, or later in the game)
I felt P7 was maybe a good continuation if the top right becomes important. 
How should B play for points in the corner?


P7 looks good, jump is probably also fine.

S2 is a good endgame, but maybe white could sometimes afford to cut. See variation.]

Marc is not that easy opponent, however he made many crucial mistakes at the bottom. The only time, when the game got complicated was when you started the squeeze K3, which was not used at the right time. Otherwise it was a dominaton victory, well done!]
