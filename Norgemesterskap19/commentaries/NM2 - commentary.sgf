PW[Sosnovsky (2149)]PB[Johan Berntsson (2201)]WR[1d]BR[2d]DT[2019-10-12]C[After this game I was told that my oponent had a long go break of four years. Apparently he is now stronger than before, he won the tournament undefeated. 


I'm familiar with this guy, no wonder he has won the tournament undefeated. I can tell you a funny story related to me and him, even though I have never met him in person. 

Some years ago (like 2012), when Sweden played in PGETC League A, there were two Swedish 1-2dans, who played very regularly. It was this guy and Micael Svensson. These two guys played on the bottom two boards and they scored many upsets (for example they achieved a draw with France). Then Czechia (we were one of the strongest teams at that time and I played on 4th board) faced Sweden and we won 3:1. You can guess, who lost - me (app. GoR 2550 at that time) by half a point against this guy. :)) So he had been definitely much stronger than 2-dan many years ago. I checked on EGD, that he was promoted to 3-dan after this tournament, but surely his level is even higher. 

So... I'm very intersted, how hard time you did manage to give him. ^^]

Few byoyomi mistakes in a row cost you very nice victory, that's a pity. Especially after a bad beginning you managed to kill a a nearly unkillable group. You started to play very well after the ko around M17 and black started to be very confused. It's a pity, that you didn't manage to keep the game until a happy ending. ])
