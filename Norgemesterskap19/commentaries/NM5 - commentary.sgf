Do I remember correctly that Norwegian Go is basically being conquered by Hanevik brothers?]

how did you manage to make this game half-point? ^^
I count you are still like a komi behind, though white played very slack. Probably white kept defending till the end. 
That was actually your chance, that white starts to think, that he can't lose anymore. Also I like, that you did not panic and played "normal" till the end. However, I believe, you endgame could have been way more precise and with white's slack play, you could definitely win this game even after the disaster at the beginning. Besides the explosion on the bottom side, you were a better player in this game, but the loss there proved to be too big.
