Yes, that is definitely something you have to work on. One badly lost game shouldn't get you down. ]

;B[gc]LB[hf:A][ih:B][kh:C]C[I didn't put any comments for a while, because this sequence was basically one-way-street, however the game is extremely difficult now for you

- you have 3 cutting points (A,B,C)
- dead group on the right 
- just some small territory at the bottom

I checked the game till the end, but your opponent didn't give you any chance to come back, so let's end the commentary here.

Your opponent took the initiative after the hame on M6, but the game was still somehow fine. Your overplay on R13 could actually work, but you wanted too much. That big exchange was too optimistic and when your opponent escaped with his group, the game was over. 

Be careful to not get too emotional after an upset game (I know, it's not easy, but it's necessary), then you start playing overplays and experienced 3-dans are often able to punish them.]
