PW[Michael Plikk (1986)]PB[Sosnovsky (2149)]WR[1k]BR[1d]DT[2019-10-13]C[Michael and his wife Carol are good friends. They are some of the most active norwegian players. I usually stay at his place in the tournaments in Oslo.

This time I was trying to play calm and solid, and wait for my opponent mistake. I think I might have played a bit too soft.


That's usually a good strategy against weaker players, let's check it out.
