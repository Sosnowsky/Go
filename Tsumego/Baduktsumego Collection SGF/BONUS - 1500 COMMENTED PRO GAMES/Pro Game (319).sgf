Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[In the round 9 of national team competition, the game between two main players Gu Li and Lee Sedol is eye-catching, as a result, Gu Li regrettably lost by half point.];W[dc];B[pp];W[dp];B[ce];W[ci]
;B[gc]LB[fc:a]C[The two-space pincer of B7 is rarely used by Gu Li, in the past he used to play one-space pincer at 'a'.];W[ed];B[jd];W[qj];B[bc];W[df];B[cf];W[dg];B[cg];W[dh];B[oc];W[qn]
;B[nq];W[fq];B[ql];W[rl];B[qh];W[pl];B[qo];W[pn];B[rn];W[rm];B[cn]C[From B11 to B29, Black elects to take territory in the opening, however White is relatively thick.];W[bp]LB[co:a][dn:b][bb:c]C[The jump of W30 appears slow, White should bump at 'a', next B 'b' and W 'c', it is huge.]
;B[bk]LB[bb:a]C[B31 is a good move! White already has no chance to attach at 'a'.];W[ck];B[cl];W[dk];B[bo];W[co];B[do];W[cp];B[bm];W[ao];B[bi];W[bh]
;B[bj];W[ch];B[bg];W[ah];B[cb]C[The diagonal of B47 is very big, also it is related to the thinness and thickness of both sides.];W[lc];B[jc]LB[dl:a]C[B49 is a bad move! It immediately ruins Black's originally good situation. Gu Li perhaps overlooks the real purpose of W48 is ladder breaker. Black should take tenuki and attach at 'a', this way the situation will be very easy for Black to play.];W[dm]C[The strike of W50 is too severe! Black can only live painfully as in the game, it can be said that Black is close to lose this game.];B[dl];W[el];B[em]
;W[en];B[fm];W[dn];B[cm];W[fl];B[al];W[gm];B[fn];W[eo];B[kq];W[oe]C[Following W64, White handles very well, this kind of place is Lee Sedol's strong point.];B[qf];W[nc]

;B[gf];W[fg];B[ee];W[fe];B[gd];W[fd];B[hh]C[White seems not fearful of Black's cut with B95.];W[ig];B[hi];W[gi];B[jf];W[hj];B[ii]
;W[jh];B[lg];W[pf];B[pd];W[qc]C[W104 and W106 are clever moves! Black is a little difficult.];B[rd];W[jj]C[After White captures three black stones with W108, if Black can't kill White's big lonely group in the upper right corner or obtain a considerable profit, Black will lose the game for sure.];B[mf];W[md];B[qk]C[B111 is Gu Li's game-deciding move.];W[pj]LB[oi:a][kf:b]C[Black couldn't directly kill White, Black wants to borrow strength from the right side, White unexpectedly falls into trap by making extension of W112! In fact, on the right side White is very strong and White shouldn't answer Black. With W112 White should make the knight's move at 'a', this way Black itself also leaves the defect at 'b', Black perhaps wouldn't obtain any profit.]
;B[oj]C[The bump of B113 is a good move!];W[mb];B[pk];W[ok];B[oi];W[kb];B[rk]C[White dare not answer again, Black gets to push out with B115, White is forced to spend one more move W118 to make life, Black turns down with B119 and obtains a big profit.];W[ro]LB[ol:a][rj:b]C[W120: White is not cool enough, White should first exchange W 'a' and B 'b', this way the situation is still to White's advantage.];B[rp];W[sn]

;B[hq]C[After Black grabs the last big point with B149, the outcome of the game is already very difficult to guess.];W[jn];B[cj];W[dj];B[ho];W[jp];B[jq];W[hr];B[gq];W[gr];B[ir];W[go];B[fr]
