;W[qj];B[qh];W[qn];B[mq];W[ci]LB[rp:a]C[W10: The common move is to make knight at 'a'.];B[ql];W[rl];B[rm];W[qm];B[rk];W[rn];B[qk]
;W[qq];B[qp];W[rp];B[pq];W[rr];B[qr];W[rq]C[Through W24, the big knight move of B9 is better than small knight, Black can be satisfied.];B[jq];W[oe]LB[jd:a]C[W26 is trend but a little hasty, to make extension on the side at 'a' is relatively steady.];B[md]C[The counterattack of B27 is inevitable.];W[qe]
;B[pd];W[qg];B[ph];W[rd];B[rc];W[rh];B[ri];W[rf]C[White fixes shape from W28 to W36.];B[sh]LB[sd:a]C[B37: Black should consider to play atari at 'a'.];W[sc];B[sb]
;W[sd];B[qb];W[rg]C[Through W42, White is basically alive.];B[cn]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.];W[cl];B[fp];W[dn];B[cq];W[co];B[dq]C[The sequence from B43 to B49 is expected result from both sides, Black can be satisfied.];W[gd]C[W50 is good move at this time.]
;B[ic];W[me];B[ld];W[id]C[W52 and W54 are playing tempo.];B[jd];W[ie]LB[jc:a]C[But with W56 White didn't cut at 'a', really inexplicable.];B[fc]C[B57: Black is alert.];W[fd];B[cc]C[Following B59, Black lives one group.];W[cd]
;B[bd];W[cb];B[bc];W[ce];B[be];W[cf];B[bb];W[db];B[bf];W[cg]C[White is over-concentrated on the outside, Black succeeds.];B[ba];W[gm]C[W72 is vital point in the center.]
;B[pj]LB[en:a][go:b]C[B73 is slow. Black should probe at 'a', then reinforce at 'b', which is imperative.

After this move, the game was closed for first day.];W[je]LB[hq:a]C[W74 is unnecessary, White should directly invade at 'a'.];B[kf];W[pf]LB[jc:a]C[W76 is too soft, White should cut at 'a', White on the right is not difficult to make life.];B[jc];W[hq];B[en]
;W[dm];B[eo];W[cp];B[fr];W[ho];B[il]LB[hk:a][hn:b]C[B85: Black originally should invade deeply at 'a', perhaps Black sees the attachment and cut at 'b' and allows White enclose center. However, this way Black also takes a certain risk.];W[hk];B[ik];W[hj];B[ij];W[ii]
;B[ji];W[ih];B[hn]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.];W[jp];B[kq];W[gn]LB[eq:a][fq:b][in:c][kn:d]C[W96 is wrong order. White should first play hane at 'a', if B 'b', then White can play hane at 'c' then jump to 'd', escaping strongly, Black also has no assurance of success, since White has no weak groups, this group wouldn't get killed.];B[go];W[gp];B[fo]
;W[hm];B[in];W[eq];B[fq];W[im];B[jn];W[jm];B[kn]C[White's three stones are captured, this game becomes close.];W[bq];B[ep];W[dr];B[cr];W[br]
;B[er];W[km];B[ln];W[jh]LB[hb:a]C[W116: For White to play at 'a' is more substantial.];B[gc];W[ki];B[lj]LB[pr:a]C[B119: For Black to connect at 'a' is bigger.];W[pr];B[or];W[qs]
;B[ai];W[bh];B[ah];W[ag];B[bg];W[aj];B[af];W[bi];B[li];W[bs];B[cs];W[kk]LB[nr:a][nn:b]C[W134 is losing move! If White has no certainty of success to clamp at 'a', at least White should jump to 'b' and aims at 'a'.]
;B[kj];W[jj];B[lk];W[jk];B[on]C[B139: Black encloses territory, White's defeat already can't be redeemed.];W[om];B[nn];W[ml];B[ll];W[lm];B[mm];W[oq];B[nq]
