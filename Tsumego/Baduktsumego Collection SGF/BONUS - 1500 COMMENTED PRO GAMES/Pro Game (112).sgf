;W[qp];B[ci];W[kc];B[nc];W[hc];B[fc];W[he];B[nq];W[pq];B[kq];W[ck];B[hq]C[B17: Black breaks away from the main battlefield, at any rate Black should play on the left side.];W[cf]
;B[ef];W[bc];B[bb]LB[cc:a][dd:b]C[The play of B19 and B21 is questionable, after the bump of W 'a' and the hane of W 'b', Black is painful, however Black is already one step slow due to B17, so no matter how Black answers, there will be no good result.];W[ch];B[di];W[dh];B[ei];W[cc];B[cb];W[dd];B[ed]
;W[db];B[ec];W[ab];B[eb];W[bi]LB[fg:a][eg:b]C[The sequence from W34 through W42 shows White's favorable consciousness, White should make the knight's move at 'a' with W34, after exchanging with B 'b', then White plays the hane on the second line, this way White would take advantage from the outside.];B[bj];W[bh];B[cj];W[co];B[dn];W[bn]
;B[bm];W[bo];B[cd];W[bd];B[de];W[ce];B[qj];W[qm]LB[ne:a]C[W48 is slow. White should play at around 'a' to reduce Black's moyo first.];B[ld];W[kd];B[le];W[qc]LB[pi:a]C[W52 could be a damaging move, White should directly make the shoulder hit at 'a'.]

However this way Black already would have incurred some losses, besides even if this is playable for Black, White can give up the three marked stones.]
;B[oh];W[oc];B[od];W[nb];B[lc]C[B67 is a strong move!];W[mc];B[lb];W[nd];B[ne];W[rd]LB[oe:a][of:b][jg:c][fg:d]C[W72 is slow! White should cuts at 'a', Black would atari at 'b', then for White to reinforce the outside at 'c' is imperative. In the game, Black strikes first to attack White, and because earlier White fails to get out with the knight's move at 'd', White already sinks into a passive position.]

After Black peeps at 'a' and pushes at 'b', instantly White has no answers, the big dragon has to run on its own, and the several stones on the right side also have died naturally, White is already losing! With W76 White should push at 'c', then B 'd', W 'e', B 77, W 'f', B 'g', W 'h', after giving up some stones, White then gets out with the knight's move at 78 (see var a).];B[gf];W[hf];B[eh]

If Black wants to destroy eye shape, then Black should directly play at 'a', Black's outside is extremely thick and should have nothing to fear, helping White settle down like this is definitely not playable!]
;W[hk];B[qf];W[kr]LB[cm:a]C[After W118, White has the gut to play at 120. Actually White should cut at 'a', aiming at Black's weakness, Black would be difficult to look after both the left and right side.];B[lq];W[jq];B[jp];W[iq];B[ip];W[hr];B[ir];W[jr];B[gr]

White should turn at 'a', White's corner will not die unconditionally, Black would be hard to win the game.]
