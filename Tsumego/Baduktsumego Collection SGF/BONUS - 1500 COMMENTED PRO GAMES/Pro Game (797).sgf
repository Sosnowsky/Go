Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[In the 6th Ahan Tongshan Cup final, Zhou Heyang 9p took Black and defeated Shao Weigang 9p by resignation, winning the champion of this event for the second time.];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[fc]
;W[hc];B[oc]C[Black first approaches the corner with B5 then comes back to protect his own corner with B7, this is a popular opening recently.];W[fd];B[ed]C[The wedge of B9 was once very popular, but recently this play is rarely seen.];W[ec];B[ee];W[fe];B[dc];W[eb];B[ff];W[gf];B[ef]
;W[cc];B[gg];W[hf];B[hg];W[if];B[ig];W[jf];B[jg];W[kf]C[Through W26, it forms a position of White's territory battling with Black's influence.];B[cn];W[dk];B[en];W[fp]
;B[gn]LB[di:a]C[B31: For Black to first pincer at 'a' is better.];W[fh]LB[fg:a]C[W32: In the game White is alert, White takes advantage in the exchange of W32 and B 'a'.];B[fg];W[hp];B[di];W[gk];B[in];W[ik];B[kk];W[jl]
;B[jo];W[kl];B[jq];W[bp];B[gq];W[fq];B[mn];W[fm];B[fn];W[ch]LB[dm:a]C[The striking of W50 is the follow-up tactic of W32, however before W50, it is perhaps much better for White to first play the sente move at 'a'.];B[ci]C[With the sequence following B51, both sides have answered with the strongest moves.]

;B[fk];W[ei];B[fl];W[dm];B[em];W[bl]C[Through the knight's move of W70, White gains considerable profit in territory, how Black to gain profit by attacking White's center stones is the key for the game.];B[lk];W[hi];B[gh];W[ji];B[ki]LB[jj:a][ii:b]C[B75 is wrong order, Black should first make the diagonal at 'a', after W 'b', then Black can proceed as in the game, this way White's eye shape would be a little worse.]
;W[kh];B[kg];W[li];B[lg];W[ll];B[mi];W[nl];B[on];W[pl]LB[nm:a][nn:b][mj:c]C[W84: White can consider to double at 'a', next B 'b' and W 'c', this is the strongest play, however in fast games, this kind of play also takes some risk.];B[ok]
;W[nm];B[nn];W[pm];B[qj];W[qo];B[pn];W[qn];B[rl];W[rm];B[ql];W[qm];B[rp]C[Black's sequence from B85 to B97 is very tight.];W[kn]
;B[op];W[mj];B[lj];W[kj];B[lh];W[qp]LB[ni:a]C[W104: White should immediately start the ko at 'a', then push at 104 as a ko threat.];B[qq];W[ni];B[ki];W[nj]C[After White connects with W108, the ko becomes relatively light for Black.];B[ph]C[B109: Black doesn't eliminate the ko, Black is very tenacious.]

;B[rr];W[qe];B[oj]LB[pf:a]C[B125: Black elects to make compromise, it is also because of fast game nature. In fact White's big group now is very dangerous, Black can directly push and cut at 'a', however, this way both sides have no way to back down, in the game White's big group makes life, White pulls through a difficult situation.];W[ro];B[nh];W[sp];B[ce];W[be];B[pd];W[nd];B[nc];W[md]
;B[mc];W[pe]LB[lc:a][lb:b][kc:c][kb:d][jc:e][gr:f]C[W136 is the biggest losing move! White should hane at 'a', next B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B136 and W 'f', this way White's situation is a little better.];B[ld];W[le];B[kd]TR[qe]C[In the real game, although White rescues the marked white stone, but Black is also very happy with B137 and B139.];W[mf]
;B[fb];W[da];B[ic];W[id]LB[gc:a]C[When Black attaches with B143, with W144 White also can only bump at 'a'.];B[hb]C[Black again connects back two stones in sente with B145, White's defeat is already decided.];W[hd];B[jc];W[re];B[gr];W[cl];B[dn]
