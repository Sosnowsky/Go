;B[cn];W[cp];B[fc];W[cf];B[kc]C[Black starts with the very popular "Mini Chinese" opening, Cho 9p is also very familiar with this fuseki.];W[qj]C[B12: For White to split the right side is inevitable.];B[qm];W[qg];B[pi]C[B15 is a favorite play of Korean players.];W[og]LB[qi:a][pf:b]C[W16 is rarely seen, the normal play is at 'a' and then Black would make the knight's move at 'b'.]
;B[qi];W[od];B[oc];W[pd];B[pc];W[qc]LB[nc:a]C[W20 and W22 are the proper moves to fix White's own shape by sacrificing, it is much better than the simple hane move at 'a'.

;B[pb];W[ob];B[qa];W[md];B[ne];W[nd]C[Black has obtained some territory and also becomes very thick.];B[hd]C[For the result up to 35, Black has nothing to complain.];W[dn];B[jp];W[pq];B[qq];W[oq]
;B[qr];W[op];B[po];W[lq];B[db]C[After the knight's move of B45, it becomes a close game.];W[ci];B[gp];W[jr]C[W48 is an excellent point which can not be let slip.];B[lp];W[kp]LB[mp:a]C[W50 is strong and fierce, the hane move at 'a' seems slack.];B[ko]
;W[kq];B[jo];W[lo];B[ln];W[mp]C[Through 56, White can be satisfied.];B[cm];W[eo];B[cj];W[bj];B[bk];W[dj];B[ck];W[bi]
;B[el];W[go];B[ho];W[gn];B[km]C[From B57 to 69, both sides are basically acceptable.];W[cc]C[W70 is the mutual good point, Black at the top seems a little vulnerable.];B[ni]C[B71: Black continues to expand his moyo, and also aims to attack White in the upper right corner.];W[ql]C[W72: White probes Black and prepares for future actions.];B[rm];W[ic]C[The invasion of W74 is very severe, the subsequent fight over here is very crucial, Black is pondering.];B[jd]C[B75 is the most relentless play.]
;W[jc]C[W76 is a good move which is not easy to find, it looks stolid but is very practical.];B[kd];W[hc];B[gc];W[kb];B[lb];W[ka];B[id];W[gb];B[lc]C[Through 85, White unexpectedly lives with sente and White is successful in this battle.];W[mg];B[ia]
;W[ib];B[ha];W[hb];B[ed]LB[la:a][fb:b]C[If B91 at 'a', then W 'b', Black is no good.];W[fb];B[de];W[ce];B[dc];W[cd]C[Through 96, White is leading in territory, how much territory Black can encircle on the right will be the key for the game.];B[nn]
;W[fk];B[fl];W[gk];B[gl];W[hk];B[hl];W[lh]C[The sequence of W98 to W104 apparently aims to attack Black's thickness at the top.];B[fg];W[mj];B[nj]C[White is happy with the exchange of W106 and B107.];W[hg]C[W108 is also a good move, attacking Black as well as surrounding territory in the center.];B[ik]C[B109: Black initiates the counter-measure bravely.]
;W[gf]C[W110: White strikes first to take advantage.];B[ej];W[fe];B[ge];W[ff];B[nb];W[mk];B[nk]C[Black already has entered into the overtime, White still has 22 minutes left in the regular time.];W[ei];B[dk];W[di]C[Through 120, White can be satisfied.];B[la]
;W[ga];B[ij];W[kj];B[ee];W[cb]C[W126 is excellent, Black is not optimistic.];B[ea];W[ca];B[fj];W[hi];B[ec];W[ja];B[fi];W[hj]

;B[ap]C[B161: Black has obviously miscalculated.];W[aq];B[me]LB[dm:a]C[B163 should be at 'a'.];W[le];B[ld];W[ao];B[lf];W[ef];B[ek];W[bn]C[W170 is a declaration of victory.];B[lg]
