Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[pd]C[In this game, Umezawa Yukari 5p didn't play well, certainly it is also because Ye Gui 5p is a very strong player.];W[dd];B[qp];W[dp];B[fq]
;W[hq];B[oq];W[qj];B[cq]C[B9 is simple and clear, this way it will easily lead to a close game.];W[dq];B[cp];W[do];B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[eq];B[cn];W[qf]LB[nc:a][qm:b]C[W18 is a little slow, White can consider to approach at 'a', next B18 and White can make an extension at 'b'.

;B[nc];W[qm];B[cf];W[fc];B[bd];W[cc];B[dh];W[mq]LB[rd:a][qc:b][kc:c]C[W26: The bottom is smaller than the top side, White is better off by playing at 'a', next B 'b' and W 'c'.];B[hc];W[bc]
;B[og]C[B27 and B29 are vivid, Black opens up the situation.];W[ph];B[fo];W[fr];B[ip];W[hp];B[io]LB[dn:a]C[The play of B33 and B35 is not to Black's advantage, Black should simply play at 'a'.];W[iq];B[dn];W[cj]C[W39 is a good urgent point! Black has no severe tactic to attack this stone.];B[ci]
;W[ej];B[fi];W[gk];B[fm];W[hj]C[W44: White escapes successfully.];B[jq];W[jr];B[hi];W[ii];B[ih]C[Perhaps Ye Gui didn't see that she is taking the upper hand in the game, so with B47 and B49, Black starts to exert power, although it seems a little far-fetched, after the game, they are regarded as the winning moves.];W[jh]C[The double hane of W50 is tight! In close-contact battles, you can't play loose moves.];B[ji]
;W[ij];B[kh];W[jg];B[hh];W[ki]LB[kg:a]C[But the following W56 is a bad move! White should turn at 'a', making sure the big dragon on the left side would get affected, this way White can fight.];B[jj]C[Next starting from B57, Black tangles with White tightly, White sinks into a bitter battle.];W[jk];B[kj];W[li];B[kk];W[kl]
;B[jl];W[ik];B[mj];W[mi];B[mk];W[ni];B[mm];W[ll];B[ml];W[jm]C[With the sequence following W72, it is obvious that White wants to kill Black's big dragon in the center.];B[il];W[hm];B[gj]
;W[hk];B[fk]C[Black also has no way to back down but to first capture White on the left side.];W[fj];B[gi];W[fl];B[gl];W[hl];B[el];W[no]LB[mo:a]C[W84 is a big bad move! Although the jump at 'a' may be also no good, but at least White would still have some hope.];B[mo]C[In the game, Black grabs the vital point with B85.];W[nn]
;B[mn];W[kq];B[ho];W[jo];B[jp];W[kp];B[jn]C[Since White itself is thin and weak, with the sequence following B93, Black makes a worry-free ko, White collapses.];W[kn];B[ko];W[lo];B[ln];W[jo];B[kg]C[The game 4 will take place on 11/12.]
