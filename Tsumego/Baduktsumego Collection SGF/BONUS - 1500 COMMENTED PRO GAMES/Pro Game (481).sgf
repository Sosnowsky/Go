;W[dr];B[fp];W[bo];B[er]C[Through 23, the variation in the lower left is a little favorable for Black.];W[jq]LB[jp:a][lq:b][jn:c]C[White makes the two-space extension with W24, aiming to put more pressure on the left black group later on. But from the result of the game, this move is not good, White should play at 'a', then B 'b' and W 'c', W24 is the main reason why White is falling behind in the opening.];B[lq];W[jo];B[jm]C[After being attacked and forced by B25 and B27, White's tempo seems slow and cumbersome.];W[lp]
;B[mp];W[lo];B[kq];W[jp];B[el];W[dk];B[gl];W[mo];B[np];W[ll];B[cf];W[ch];B[ek]C[B41 is the top-notch thick play of "blunt knife" (Qian Yuping's nickname).]
;W[fc];B[dj]C[The sequence after B43 is very tight.];W[cj];B[di];W[ci];B[dh];W[cg]
(;B[cd]LB[dg:a][ce:b][df:c][bf:d]C[B49: If Black blocks at 'a', then after W 'b', B 'c' and W 'd', White's territory would be too big, Black can not be satisfied (see var a).];W[cc];B[dc]C[B49 and B51: Black starts the sabaki moves.];W[ce];B[bd];W[db];B[de];W[ec];B[dg]
;W[ee];B[be];W[ef];B[df];W[cm]C[Through 62, the game is about even for both sides, but Black has obtained sente and can be satisfied.];B[qm]C[Black has grabbed the big extension big of B63, Black's efficiency of playing first is adequate.];W[qg];B[mc];W[rd];B[qc];W[kc];B[rf]
;W[qf];B[re];W[qe];B[qd];W[rg];B[rc];W[kk]C[W76 is the proper play to strengthen White himself, because being hindered by the weak stones on the lower side, White is hard to effectively expand his moyo at the top.];B[if]C[B77 is a shallow reduction to White's territory.];W[ke]LB[id:a]C[W78 is inevitable, if White encloses territory at 'a', White's territory would be clearly not enough.];B[ih];W[ik]
;B[il];W[me]LB[ie:a]C[Although W82 is a good spot, but the attachment at 'a' is better.];B[nm]C[With the sequence after B83, Black takes advantage in sente.];W[jl];B[im];W[km];B[jj];W[jk];B[mm]C[Through 89, Black has reinforced his lower right corner.];W[lm];B[id]C[B91: Black has ruined White's territory at the top, Black is clearly leading in territory.]
;W[ig]C[The wedge of W92 is a clever move.];B[jg];W[hg];B[jf]C[Black can only atari and connect with B93 and B95.];W[pl];B[pm];W[hh]C[Through 98, Black has been surrounded, instantly the situation becomes complicated.];B[lg];W[nc];B[nb];W[md];B[oc]LB[lc:a]C[B93 is not good, Black should bump at 'a'.]
;W[ii];B[lc];W[je];B[nf];W[ie]LB[mg:a]C[Although White has gained some profit by pushing with W108, but this was a play that Kobayashi very regretted, now White should immediately crosscut at 'a', Black in the center is very troublesome.];B[hf];W[he];B[jh];W[kb]LB[rk:a]C[W112: White ends in gote and Black has the chance to grab the good spot at 'a'.];B[rk]C[After B113, White is already not optimistic.]
;W[hi];B[oh];W[oj];B[rj];W[qi];B[ni]C[B115, B117 and B119 are all solid plays, Black steadily charges forward.];W[ol];B[om];W[og];B[of]LB[ng:a]C[The clamp of B123 is a good move, if Black carelessly blocks at 'a', it would lead to his defeat.];W[ph]
;B[ng];W[nd]LB[oi:a][bg:b][pg:c][jr:d]C[W126 is not appropriate, White should atari at 'a', then B 126, W 'b', B 'c' and W 'd', this way the game would be very close.];B[oi]C[B127 is a good move, White again ends in gote.];W[nj];B[mi];W[lj];B[mj];W[nl];B[qk]
;W[pe];B[bg]C[After Black's tiger move of B135, the outcome of White's defeat can not be altered.];W[ob];B[mb];W[bh];B[ld];W[le];B[ah];W[ai];B[ag];W[dm];B[em];W[pb]

Later on Qian 9p continued his practice and prepared for the final match with Cho Chikun which was scheduled on 8/3/1991. But one day, he suddenly felt a big headache, after examined by the doctors, it was found that his neurasthenia recurred, and he must recuperate and be treated. On 8/1/1991, Chinese Go Association officially announced: because the Chinese player Qian Yuping was suddenly sick and would forfeit the final match, so Cho Chikun won the champion of the 4th Fujitsu Cup without fights.])
