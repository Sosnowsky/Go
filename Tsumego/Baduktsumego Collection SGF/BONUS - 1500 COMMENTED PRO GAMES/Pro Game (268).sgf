;B[cn];W[cp];B[fc]LB[dm:a][fq:b][ci:c][cg:d][cf:e][dn:f][cj:g]C[The purpose of B9 is, if Black proceeds normally at 'a' by joseki, next W 'b' and B 'c', White has the good point at 'd'; B9 is an asking move, if White makes the small knight's move at 'e', then Black plays by joseki, if White makes the large knight's move at 'd', Black may elect to play the joseki of B 'f', W 'b' and B 'g'.];W[cf];B[dm];W[fq];B[ci]C[Through B13, it is a common opening.]

After this move, it is time for lunch break.]
;B[fe];W[ed];B[hd];W[dh]C[After White separates with W48, Black is hard to take care of both sides.];B[gf]C[Through B49, Black gains at the top, but Black's left side becomes very thin.];W[cl];B[bm];W[dj];B[bk];W[eg];B[bg];W[bf]
