Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[Congratulations to Piao Wenyao's first champion of his career!];W[pp];B[dc];W[cp];B[ep]
;W[eq];B[fq];W[dq];B[qn];W[nq];B[ce]C[B1 to B11 is fast opening, not like Piao's style. He likes to play steadily.];W[od];B[ld]LB[pg:a]C[Since B5 and B7 were already played, White is not favorable in ladder, so White can't play "demon sword" joseki at 'a'.];W[qe]C[W14 is clever choice.];B[re];W[pe]
;B[rf]C[B15 and B17 are simple and clear, Piao comes back to his style.];W[qc];B[rc];W[pd];B[rd];W[qb]LB[ph:a]C[W22 is also possible, but in this situation, White more wants to play at 'a'.];B[qh];W[mc]C[W24 is related to life-and-death and can't be omitted.];B[lc];W[lb];B[kb]
;W[mb];B[fp]LB[gp:a]C[B29: For Black to hang at 'a' is a little better.];W[cn];B[lq];W[rp];B[lo];W[jc]LB[em:a]C[Next for Black to play at 'a' is better.];B[on]LB[fm:a]C[After White takes 'a', Black's shape at bottom is not good.]
;W[fm]C[W36 is good point!];B[nh];W[hm];B[ro]C[B39: Black is difficult. If answering, White will be over-concentrated. If not answering, Black also has some comprehension.];W[qq];B[dj];W[hp]LB[ip:a]C[If W42 at 'a', Black is even more painful.];B[hq];W[iq];B[ip];W[ho]
;B[ir];W[jq];B[jr]C[Black is being condensed very terribly, but anyway Black puts this behind.];W[nj];B[ic]LB[pj:a]C[B51 breaks away from main battle field. Now the right side is bigger, Black should play at 'a'.];W[id];B[hc];W[pj]C[White jumps down with W54, Black's moyo disappears, White succeeds in the opening.];B[nr];W[or];B[jb]
;W[pm];B[om];W[qi];B[rh];W[lj];B[ok];W[oj];B[ph];W[ch];B[jj]LB[dg:a]C[B67 again breaks away from main battle field, to play at 'a' is urgent.];W[eh];B[fj]
;W[gh]C[W70: White plays smoothly his lonely stones, Black's situation becomes even worse.];B[hj];W[pl];B[pn];W[rm]LB[ol:a]C[W74 is not appropriate, to play at 'a' is relatively better.];B[rj]C[B75 hits White's vital point, White is very painful.];W[rk];B[dg];W[dh]LB[eg:a]C[W78: White wants to press at 'a', the play in the real game is heavy.]
;B[bj];W[ff]LB[ee:a]C[W80 at 'a' is better, easy to dodge.];B[cg];W[bi];B[cm];W[dn];B[ih]C[B85 is severe.];W[ee]C[Now White has more territory, but White at top is too thin and not easy to handle, Black overturns the situation.];B[bg];W[ec];B[db]
;W[hd];B[gc];W[if];B[fd];W[ed]C[When W94, White already can't handle his shape well.];B[eg]C[In the game, White simply connects all together, a desperate fighting attitude.];W[fg];B[fi];W[fh];B[hg];W[hf];B[qk]
;W[ql];B[sk];W[rl];B[fe];W[ef];B[gf]LB[em:a]C[B107 is brave move and worth praising, but for Black to prepare at 'a' first is better.];W[ge];B[gg];W[gj]C[The wedge of W110 is good tesuji!];B[gi]LB[em:a][en:b][gk:c]C[Looking back, if Black makes exchange of B 'a' and W 'b', White can play atari from outside at 'c'.]
;W[hh];B[ig];W[hi];B[ii];W[gk]C[White cuts with W116, leading to a capturing race, the situation instantly becomes intense!];B[ck]LB[cj:a]C[If B117 at 'a', the variation is complicated.];W[aj]C[W118 is the vital point.];B[ak];W[ai];B[bl];W[ej]C[Next White plays wedge again with W122.]
;B[ek]C[Black's liberty is tight, dangerous.];W[fk];B[ei];W[di];B[ej];W[el];B[bn];W[cj];B[ci];W[fc];B[gd];W[cj];B[dk]
;W[bk];B[co];W[al]LB[do:a][cd:b]C[W138 is inexplicable, White certainly should continue the ko fight at 'a', since White has ko threat at 'b', Black is not good.];B[do];W[cl];B[dm];W[dl]C[Black takes a group of white stones happily, but ...];B[bp];W[bq];B[cr]LB[cq:a]C[..., but the big corner is being killed (if W 'a' next, it is life-and-death problem. If you can kill White, your strength will be equal to champion's).]
;W[lf]C[After the exchange, White incurs big loss in territory and already can't win the game.];B[kf]C[In the end, Black backs down a little, but it already has nothing to do with the outcome.];W[kg];B[ke];W[en];B[ri];W[ol];B[qj];W[mm];B[mn];W[mr];B[jp]
