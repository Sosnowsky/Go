The game 1 of Kisei title match usually will take place in Europe, America or some other countries, in 1994, it was held in China, this almost becomes a "joseki". The challenger Hane Naoki, Kisei Yamashita Keigo and Honinbo Cho U are all new hopes of Japanese Go arena. From the viewpoint of Hane Naoki obtaining the right to challenge, in 2004 Japanese Go scene will be controlled by the above three young stars.];W[dp]C[The referee of this game is Ishida Yoshio 9p.];B[pp];W[dd];B[oc]
;W[qj];B[cn];W[dk];B[fq];W[dn];B[cq];W[cm];B[dq];W[fd];B[qh];W[qn];B[nq]C[In all the games between Hane Naoki and Yamashita Keigo, it will always lead to a position that Hane takes territory and Yamashita controls the outside influence, the opening up to B17 has already developed this trend.];W[kd]LB[oj:a]C[However W18 is not proper and overly seeking, to jump at 'a' instead would be very dignified, also not conflicting with the strategy of taking influence.]
;B[ql];W[oj]C[In the game, when Black invades with B19, White's jump always seems one step slow.];B[pn];W[oh]LB[po:a]C[The moves from W22 to W26 are over generous. With W22, White certainly should consider to wedge at 'a'.];B[pi];W[pj];B[qf];W[mj];B[cd]C[B27: In the game, Black takes tenuki and is alert!];W[ce];B[be]
;W[de];B[cc];W[bf];B[eb];W[fb];B[ec];W[fc];B[bd];W[cg]C[W38: White again ends in gote, White has failed in the opening.];B[mc]LB[qo:a]TR[ql]C[B39: For Black to strengthen at 'a' would be very satisfied, in the game Black takes lightly the marked black stone in order to contain White's moyo.]
;W[qo]C[Therefore, White certainly should move out with W40.];B[qp]C[The block of B41 is pre-planned.];W[po];B[oo];W[rp];B[rq];W[on]LB[pm:a]C[With W44 and W46, White thinks that to atari out at 'a' can't be satisfied and White must do something else.];B[pm];W[op];B[no];W[oq]
;B[ro]C[But Black can capture three stones and also stick his head out in front, Black has nothing to complain.];W[np];B[mo];W[mp];B[lo];W[lp]LB[qq:a][kq:b]C[White crawls with one more move of W56, which has a bad effect on enclosing center territory, here White certainly should directly wrap up at 'a', then get out with the knight's move at 'b'.];B[ko];W[qq];B[sp];W[pq]
;B[rp];W[le];B[jj]LB[ij:a]C[The selection of B63 is not appropriate, this is Black's only questionable move in this game. Black should play at 'a', which is just right, White can't kill and can't enclose territory either.];W[jq];B[bo];W[nd]C[After this move, the game was closed for the first day.

The game will continue tomorrow at 9:00am.
];B[lb];W[pe];B[qe];W[ij]C[The attachment of W70 is a strong move!];B[ik]
;W[ji];B[jk]LB[hj:a][gk:b]C[B73: Black should play the atari at 'a' then make the tiger's move at 'b', now destroying White's essential territory is the key.];W[hj];B[ki];W[li];B[gk];W[gj];B[fj];W[hk];B[hl];W[fk]

;W[ng]C[Through W96, White finally has enclosed a big territory, the difference between both sides has been narrowed down dramatically.];B[jc];W[kc];B[kb];W[hq];B[jd];W[je];B[hd];W[ie]LB[he:a]C[Next with W104, for White to attach at 'a' is slightly better.];B[hb];W[he]
;B[bl]LB[dm:a][bk:b]TR[dp]C[B107: For Black to cut at 'a' is a good move, this way White can't look after the tactic of Black's jump-in at 'b' and the separation of the marked white stone at the same time.];W[bk];B[rr]LB[gr:a]C[B109: For Black to make the diagonal's extension at 'a' would be more simple and clear.];W[ml];B[ol];W[nk];B[fl];W[ek]
;B[os];W[im];B[il];W[km];B[fo];W[fr];B[er];W[ep];B[gq];W[gr]LB[hp:a]C[W124: However, in the game it is regrettable that White can't extend at 'a'.];B[hp];W[iq]
