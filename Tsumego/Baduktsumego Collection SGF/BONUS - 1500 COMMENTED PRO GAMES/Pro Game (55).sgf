Translation:GoGameWorld.];B[qd]C[In the first five games, Cho U leads by 3:2. In the game 6 of the 58th Japanese Honinbo title match, under an unfavorable situation, Cho U exercised patience and capitalized on his opponent's mistakes. In the end Cho u achieved a big victory by defeating Kato Masao 9.5 points and therefore won the Honinbo title by 4:2 in best-of-7 series.];W[dp];B[cd];W[pp];B[oc]
;W[fc];B[qn];W[pk];B[qi];W[np]LB[qo:a][pn:b]TR[pk]C[The jump of W10 is the correct move. Normally in this shape, White should first make the diagonal's extension at 'a', Black will extend at 'b', then White jumps to 10. This way although White protects the corner at 'a', but after Black extends out at 'b', the marked white stone becomes weak, so the simple jump of W10 is the proper shape.];B[iq];W[kq];B[fq];W[eq];B[fp]
;W[dn]LB[cn:a]C[The jump of W16 is the style of Kato Masao. In this situation, most players will choose to play the small knight's move at 'a'. However Kato Masao is good at attacks, so he prefers to play at the higher position to put pressure on Black.];B[qq];W[qp];B[rp];W[io];B[fn];W[go];B[fo];W[dl];B[hm]LB[jp:a]C[B25: Not sure why Black doesn't make the diagonal's extension at 'a'.]
;W[ko]C[In the game, after White jumps back with W26, White's shape is complete, but Black's big group is still not completely alive.];B[cg]LB[dc:a][ic:b][cc:c]C[B27: Black still needs to play at 'a' first to exchange for White's two-space extension at 'b', then play his own two-space extension at 27. In the game B27 looks like a steady move, but after White attaches under at 'c', Black is very painful.];W[cc];B[dc];W[dd];B[bc];W[cb];B[ed];W[de]
;B[ec];W[bd];B[ce];W[cf];B[be];W[bf];B[ad];W[df]TR[cg]LB[bb:a][ab:b][af:c][ae:d][aa:e]C[The sequence from W36 to W42 is excellent! Not only the marked black stones have been completely separated, and Black still needs to reinforce at 'a', otherwise White has the tactic of W 'a', B 'b', W 'c', B 'd' and W 'e', initiating a ko.]
;B[bb];W[fe]LB[ge:a]C[W44: For White to knight-blockade at 'a' would be better. This way White's moyo on the left is huge and White's shape is also intact, White is favorable.];B[fd];W[gd];B[ge];W[ee];B[hd];W[gc];B[db];W[eb];B[ca];W[hc]
;B[he];W[jc];B[je];W[lc];B[eh];W[eg];B[fh]LB[fg:a][fi:b][ff:c]C[B61 is loose, the hane at 'a' is tight. If White dares not cut at 61, no matter whether Black ataris at 'b' or hit at 'c', White would be no good.];W[dh];B[di];W[ci]C[W62 and W64 are tesujis. White makes life in sente while obtaining 7-8 points of territory.]
;B[ch];W[dg];B[cj];W[bi];B[ej];W[bj];B[ck];W[dk];B[dj];W[fl]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.];B[gn];W[cl];B[bk]
;W[gk];B[hh];W[il]LB[ho:a]C[W80: White turns back to cap and Black is forced to live grievously at 'a'.];B[ho]
(;W[rd]LB[ro:a][rq:b][qo:c][or:d][oj:e][pg:f][qc:g][qe:h]C[W82 is a clever move! If White first plays at 'a', then B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e' and Black would enclose territory at 'f'. If White then attaches with at 82, Black can kill White at 'g'; However when White attaches first at 82, if Black retreats at 'g', then White can directly move out at 'h'.];B[qe];W[ro];B[rq];W[qo];B[or]
;W[oj];B[mq];W[lf];B[kh];W[re];B[rc];W[qf];B[pf];W[pg]C[W96 is a good move.]
(;B[rf]LB[qg:a][of:b][qh:c][ph:d][rg:e][og:f][pi:g]C[B97: If Black ataris at 'a', then W97, B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f' and W 'g', Black would still get killed. In the game Black can only kill two white stones on the side.];W[qg];B[rg];W[rh];B[sd];W[qh]TR[qi]C[White takes the chance to separate the marked black stone with W100 and W102, White is taking a big lead.]
;B[ql];W[qk];B[rk];W[rj];B[om];W[pn]LB[mm:a][mp:b][nl:c][nj:d]C[W108 is slow. White should either kill Black at 'a' or play thickness at 'b' as in the game, no matter which White to choose, White would still keep the lead. In the game, White allows Black to escape at 'c', then strengthen at 'b', again permits Black to escape at 'd' again, White's marksmanship is in a big mess.];B[nl];W[nq];B[nr]
;W[pq];B[pr]C[After this move, this game was closed for the first day.];W[mp];B[nj];W[li];B[ok];W[pl]LB[oi:a]C[W118: White is in disorder again. If White extends at 'a', Black has no way to connect.];B[lh];W[mk];B[pj];W[oi]

(;W[er]LB[cp:a][dq:b][bp:c][br:d][bo:e][dr:f]C[W170 is a big mistake! For White to block at 'a', allowing Black to hane over at 170, certainly can't be considered, but at least White should play at 'b', followed by B 'c', W 'a', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f' and W170. White would not only have kept his side territory but also ruined Black's territory, White would still be favorable (see var a).];B[co];W[do];B[cp];W[cn];B[bn];W[bm]
;B[an];W[ap];B[br];W[ar]LB[bo:a][am:b][aq:c]C[W180 is a disastrous mistake! After Black connects at 'a', Black's corner is alive unconditionally and Black still can connect back at 'b', White has incurred a heavy loss! White should cut at 'a', B 'c', and White can tenuki to attack Black in the center.];B[am];W[bl];B[bo];W[nh];B[oh];W[pi]
