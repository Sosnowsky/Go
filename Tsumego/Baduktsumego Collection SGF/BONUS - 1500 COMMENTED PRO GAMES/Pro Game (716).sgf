;B[kc];W[qn];B[ql];W[on]LB[pk:a]C[After White jumps with W10, White makes the shoulder-hit at 'a', which is rarely seen.];B[np];W[pk];B[pl]LB[mq:a]C[B11: If Black makes two-space extension at 'a', Black may not want to push and cut with B13.];W[ol];B[ok];W[qk]

;B[lp];W[kn];B[ng];W[nh];B[kj];W[kh];B[ij];W[jp]C[The fight up to W50 is almost inevitable.];B[jq]LB[qq:a]C[B51 is a good move, better than blocking the corner at 'a'.];W[iq];B[kq]
;W[ih];B[gj];W[gh]LB[ej:a]C[It is worth study whether the exchange of W56 and B 'a' is to White's advantage or not, White can consider to invade the top directly.];B[ej]C[If White is thick in the center, White certainly should attack Black at 57. With the exchange of W56 and B57, it seems Gu Li feels his situation is not bad, but after B57, White already can't make a big moyo on the left side, White's thickness in the center is difficult to be used.];W[hc];B[lm];W[ln];B[le];W[jk];B[jj];W[ne]
;B[lg];W[mg];B[nc];W[md];B[mc];W[ld];B[kd];W[ke];B[je];W[kf];B[id];W[jf]C[Through W76, in the exchange of the top side and the center, White obtains some profit and also tangles with Black by using Black's weakness of tight liberty, but White ends in gote.];B[hq]C[B77: Black is an unexpected good move.]
;W[cn];B[ip];W[ec];B[eb];W[db];B[ed];W[dc];B[hd]C[Through B85, it seems Black is a little favorable. However, the board is still very big, the outcome of the game is not clear.];W[ro]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.];B[sn]C[The counter-sente move of B87 is very big.];W[qc];B[pd]
;W[pc];B[ob];W[sf];B[rg];W[pb];B[rd];W[rb]C[Through W96, White lives a small corner and tries to reduce the difference in territory, now it is a close game.];B[dr];W[cq];B[cm];W[dm];B[cl];W[fk]
;B[bn];W[dn];B[bp]C[As to W102, Black completely takes territory with B103 and B105.];W[fj]C[Now the key is the offense and defense in the center and whether White can redeem his loss in the lower-left corner.];B[jm];W[io];B[hp];W[ml];B[mm];W[nm];B[ll];W[nk]
;B[hm]C[Through B115, Black handles the center well, White fails in the attack.];W[cj];B[co];W[do];B[bq];W[gk];B[hk];W[fb];B[gb];W[ea];B[gc];W[km];B[kl]
;W[ho];B[mk];W[li];B[nl];W[qq];B[pp];W[ml];B[gl];W[ek];B[nl]TR[cj][ek]C[Through B137, in the fight around this area, White only gets two moves (the marked two stones) and is not enough to catch up.];W[si]TR[gh][ej]C[So far, it seems Gu Li didn't give a play to his talent, I feel, with the exchange of W56 and B57, the game becomes tasteless.]

;B[fo];W[ep];B[fq];W[gp];B[gq]C[Black is alive in the center, White is ko-living in the upper-right corner, White in the lower-right corner is alive cleanly.];W[ch];B[qa];W[oc];B[od];W[nb];B[mb];W[oa];B[ra]
;W[qb];B[sb];W[sc];B[rc]C[Black initiates a ko with B181, which is not simple and clear.];W[sa];B[so];W[gn]C[W184 is good timing, later on, if playing this, White may end in gote.];B[fn];W[sp];B[sb];W[hn];B[gm]
;W[sa];B[sq];W[sr]LB[rp:a][ps:b]C[W192: If White connects at 'a', White can also live, but B 'b' becomes sente.];B[sb];W[lj];B[lk];W[sa]LB[os:a]C[If White can get to play endgame hane at 'a' in sente, the result is same, gain and loss is about equivalent.];B[rp];W[rq]
;B[sb];W[il];B[jl];W[sa];B[sp];W[rs];B[sb]C[Lee Changho perhaps already have calculated clearly ko threats.];W[bo]C[W206: White has no other choice, final tenaciousness.];B[cp];W[sa];B[ci];W[dk]
