;W[qn];B[qp];W[pj];B[qh];W[on];B[mp];W[eq];B[fq];W[dq];B[fp];W[cn];B[jp]C[Through B17, it is a very normal opening.];W[nc]LB[rj:a][qk:b]TR[pj]C[W18: For White to jump to 'a' is better, otherwise the earlier marked white stone should be played as the two-space extension at 'b', which is more solid.]
;B[pc];W[kc];B[pl]C[The invasion of B21 is severe.]
(;W[op]LB[po:a][oo:b][ol:c][pm:d][pn:e][om:f][nm:g][ok:h][pk:i][rm:j]C[The jump of W22 is a bad move, after being pushed and captured by B 'a' and B 'b', White has incurred a big loss, White should simply attach at 'c', then B 'd', W 'e', B 'f', W 'g'. Next if Black ataris at  'h', then W 'i', Black takes, White hanes over, and Black has no follow-up maneuver (see var a); The strongest play of Black is, instead of the atari at 'h', Black could jump to 'j', White then jump at 22, settling the shape in sente, this is clearly better than the real game.];B[po];W[pn];B[oo]
;W[pk];B[oh]C[After Black jumps with B27, White needs to reinforce with one more move, White is already falling behind in the opening.];W[ol];B[cf];W[fc]LB[ce:a][df:b][fd:c]C[The knight's move W30 is too insipid, White should think of some uncommon moves, for example, W 'a', B 'b' and W 'c'.];B[bd];W[cc];B[ci]C[After the knight's move of B31 and the extension of B33, Black is very happy.];W[ne]

;W[er];B[hq];W[rb];B[ri];W[rc];B[rd];W[de];B[rk];W[ql];B[jg]LB[jf:a]C[The play of B57 is affected by some favorable consciousness, in fact now Black is very thick, so he could dive more deeply, if B 'a', White can't kill Black, White would be no good.];W[if];B[jf]
;W[je];B[ke]LB[kf:a][ig:b][hf:c][ie:d][gg:e]C[The play of B61 is questionable, after being cut by W 'a', the game becomes closer. Black should first turn at 'b', if W 'c', then B 61, if White connects at 'd', then Black can jump to 'e'.];W[ie];B[ig];W[hg];B[hh];W[kf];B[gg]
;W[hf];B[fh];W[ih]LB[lf:a]C[W70 at 'a' is the proper move, perhaps White feels he is not optimistic, so he elects to cut.];B[kg];W[hi];B[gh];W[ii]TR[kf]C[As for Black, it is always not bad if he can take the marked white stone.];B[lf];W[fj];B[ei]
;W[ki];B[lc];W[lb];B[gf];W[ge];B[fe];W[gd];B[kd];W[jc];B[ej]LB[nf:a][di:b]C[B87 is almost the losing move! Black didn't expect he would incur such a fierce and ruthless counter-attack! Otherwise it is more imperative for him to reinforce at 'a', if W 'b', then Black can take the opportunity to attach out at 87, Black would have nothing to fear of.];W[re]C[The clamp of W88 is severe.]
;B[se];W[nf]LB[ng:a][mg:b]C[When W90, Black dares not to hang at 'a', otherwise after White hanes at 'b', Black would be in danger.];B[lh];W[qe];B[qd];W[pe];B[oe];W[od];B[rf];W[oc];B[sd]
;W[sc];B[sf];W[og];B[pf];W[pg];B[qf];W[nh]C[With the sequence from W92 to W106, Black's territory has been condensed terribly, the outcome of the game is already not clear.];B[li];W[kk];B[lj];W[kj];B[mg];W[ng]
;B[ml]LB[no:a][ln:b][km:c]C[B113: At any rate, Black should make life steadily, running out again allows White the variation following White's block at 'a'.];W[lm];B[ll];W[kl];B[mm];W[no];B[ln];W[np];B[km]C[The play of B119 and B121 is very risky. Only if White lives in the center, Black would lose the game for sure.]
