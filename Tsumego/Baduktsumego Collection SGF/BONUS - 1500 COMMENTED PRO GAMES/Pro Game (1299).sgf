;W[cn];B[op];W[qf]LB[jp:a]C[W8: In the real game, for White to simply pincer at 'a' is better.];B[pi];W[nc]LB[qc:a]C[W10: For White to choose 3-3 joseki at 'a' is a little better.];B[pf];W[pg];B[of];W[qc];B[qe]
;W[pc];B[rf]C[Through B17, Black's configuration for the whole game is very vivid.];W[jp];B[lp];W[dr];B[hp];W[jn];B[hn];W[jl];B[hl];W[jj]LB[qq:a][rp:b][mm:c]C[W26: White should first attach at 'a' to probe Black, if Black still descends at 'b', White can consider to make the big knight at 'c', this way Black's side territory is not big.]
;B[ml];W[qq]C[In the game, now White comes to take the corner, it is already not the best timing.];B[rp];W[pq];B[oq];W[or];B[nr];W[pp];B[po];W[oo]LB[rq:a][qo:b][os:c]C[W36: White can only block simply at 'a', next B 'b' and W 'c', this is also ko-living, but Black's outside wouldn't be that thick.]
;B[pn];W[qr]C[The play of W32 and W38 is really to my surprise!];B[mq];W[ps];B[ns];W[os];B[km];W[jm];B[rr];W[rq];B[sq];W[sr];B[ss]
;W[mj];B[ok];W[rs]LB[hj:a]C[W54: White immediately starts the ko, again to my suprise. White should first jump to 'a', if Black reinforces the ko at 52, it makes a big difference from the real game where the ko was taken cleanly; If Black answers the left side, White can wait for ko threats then start ko fight, this is clearly better than the real game.];B[qs]C[It is very obvious that White is heavy and Black is light for the ko, and White has no proper ko threats.];W[gm];B[hm];W[rs];B[do];W[eo];B[qs];W[hj]
;B[pr]C[Black eliminates the ko, Black already achieves a big advantage.];W[fk];B[ep]C[Black's sequence following B63 is simple and clear.];W[eq];B[fp];W[dn];B[er];W[dq];B[cf]C[White gets to approach with B69, White's territory is clearly inadequate.];W[iq]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.];B[fo]

;B[gn];W[he]C[Following W86, White has to kill Black's big group, which is clearly far-fetched.];B[cg];W[di];B[gd]C[Following B89, Black lives easily.];W[id];B[gc]C[It can be said that after the ko fight in the lower right corner, White is already difficult to have chance to win.];W[fb];B[gb];W[ib];B[db];W[cb]
