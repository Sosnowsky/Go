;W[eg];B[di];W[ie]C[From B9 to W22, it is common joseki, White is fine.];B[jq];W[ck];B[ci];W[po];B[np];W[no];B[mo];W[qq];B[qr];W[pr]LB[fe:a][qp:b][rr:c][op:d][nq:e][nm:f]C[The cut of W32 is not good, since B 'a' is a good ko threat, White is not favorable to fight a ko now. With W32 for White to retreat at 'b' is better, next B 'c', W 'd', B 'e' and W 'f', this variation is better than real game.]
;B[qp];W[oq];B[rq];W[pp];B[nn];W[qq];B[fe];W[pq]C[When B39, White is already not easy to answer locally, so elect to simply eliminate the ko.];B[fc];W[hc];B[ee];W[fb];B[eb]LB[gf:a][gc:b][qo:c]C[The hane of B45 is not good. Black should make diagonal at 'a', next W 'b' and B 'c'.]
;W[ec];B[gb];W[fd];B[gc];W[ge];B[hb];W[ff]C[Although Black destroys White's side territory, White captures two stones and becomes very thick, it is not to Black's advantage.];B[qo];W[qn];B[rn];W[pm];B[qm];W[pn]
;B[ql];W[rr];B[cn];W[co];B[cq]LB[dn:a]C[B63: Normally Black will extend at 'a', but B63 in the game is very nimble.];W[dn];B[eq];W[gq];B[dq];W[go];B[nr]C[The jump of B69 is huge and related to eye space for both sides.]
;W[lr]C[W70 striking on second line is sharp play of Lee Sedol's style.];B[lq]LB[nq:a]C[B71: Black can consider to connect at 'a'.];W[mq]LB[lp:a][nq:b][mr:c][kr:d][jr:e][fp:f]C[Next with B73 Black should retreat at 'a', next W 'b', B 'c', W 'd' ad B 'e', Black sacrifices two stones and makes outside thick, later on Black can make diagonal out at 'f' to pound on White's thinness.];B[kq]C[B71 and B73 are wrong answers, Black sinks into passivity.];W[nq]
;B[mr];W[lo];B[mp];W[ln]C[W76 and W78 are clever moves!];B[lp]C[Black can only connect with dame move, the roles of thickness and thinness have been switched.];W[jo];B[nl];W[bj];B[bi];W[rp];B[ro];W[sq]
;B[oc];W[nd];B[ph];W[qc]C[Following W90, White makes himself thick by sacrificing.];B[pc];W[qd];B[qe];W[qb];B[rd];W[oe];B[pe];W[rc];B[re]

;W[lk];B[hp];W[gp];B[fj];W[gk];B[jj]LB[gj:a]C[B131 is game-deciding move, the common move is to press at 'a', but Black is difficult to give komi.];W[gj];B[lj];W[kk];B[kj];W[mk];B[jk]
;W[nk];B[jm];W[jn];B[ni];W[pj];B[ok];W[mi]LB[ol:a]C[W144: White didn't cut at 'a', which is really inexplicable. Since W 'a' is sente, this way White itself is very safe.];B[mj];W[nj];B[ol]C[B147: Black is alert!];W[oj]LB[kl:a][km:b][mh:c]C[W148 is last losing move! Lee Sedol may overlook B 'a', White will be killed. White should reinforce at 'a', next B 'c', and W148, the game would be close and still slightly to White's advantage.]
