Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[Perhaps recently Lee Sedol's schedule is too tight. In round 3 of Sibdang Cup, Lee Sedol was clearly not in a good state and he didn't give any trouble to his opponent and lost the game easily.];W[dc];B[pp];W[dp];B[oc]
;W[qj];B[ce]C[The opening from B1 to B7 is popular nowadays.];W[ci];B[ed];W[ec];B[fd];W[fc]LB[cc:a]C[W12: White crawls with one more move to guard against White's attachment at 'a'. Of course, White is not bad either, we can only say Lee Sedol more likes to play this way.];B[gd];W[hc];B[ck];W[ei]
;B[cn];W[ek]LB[co:a]C[W18 is thick play, to seek efficiency, White can make diagonal at 'a'.];B[bp]LB[en:a][co:b]C[B19: Black takes territory, if Black jumps to 'a', next W 'b' makes Black uncomfortable.];W[en];B[fq]C[B21 is the vital point, White is a little difficult.];W[cq];B[bq];W[gp]LB[dn:a]C[W24: White's play is of great momentum. However White can be really satisfied in the real game? For White to bump at 'a' is relatively normal.]
;B[fp];W[fo];B[gq];W[hp];B[hq];W[ip];B[do];W[eo];B[ep];W[iq];B[dq]C[Through B35, Black's corner territory is big and Black's efficiency is also high, overall Black is not bad.];W[nq];B[qn]
;W[no];B[pr]C[B39 completely takes territory.];W[pm];B[pn];W[om];B[qm];W[pk];B[ki]C[Then Black invades White's moyo with B45, this way Black is easier to play.];W[kg]LB[ff:a]C[W46: White starts to attack, this fight is very important to White. Since White's territory is not enough, if attack fails, White is very difficult to redeem the situation. Looking back, with W46 if White first attacks Black at 'a', Black is not easy to make life. White can try to conduct two-pronged attack, this is more powerful.];B[ii];W[ig]
;B[fh]C[B49 is good move. Although two black groups are painful to make life, as long as Black can make it, Black can win the game.];W[ff];B[hd];W[ic];B[gf];W[dn];B[co];W[gg];B[fg];W[gh];B[ef]C[Through B59, Black first makes life one group, White's play is questionable.];W[fi]
;B[lh]C[B61: Black concentrates to handle just one group, obviously it is not difficult.];W[mf];B[nh];W[of];B[mk];W[qf];B[ne];W[pc];B[pd];W[nf];B[kl]C[With B65 and B71, Black forms a solid shape in the center, Black is favorable.];W[qc]C[W72 is severe.]
;B[ob];W[rd];B[re];W[rb];B[qe]C[By favorable ko threats, White forces Black to retreat with B77, White gains a lot. However Black is still leading in territory.];W[pb];B[mc];W[il];B[mm];W[ln]C[W82: White grabs territory desperately.];B[on]C[B83: Black separates White, the fight is far-fetched for White.];W[lb]

;W[rc];B[pf];W[pg];B[rf]C[B99 and B101 are good moves! After making a ko, Black will not have problem to make life.];W[pe];B[qg];W[qh];B[pf];W[ml];B[oe];W[lk];B[mj];W[ll]
;B[jk];W[lm];B[hj];W[cd];B[bd];W[bc];B[dd];W[cc];B[cg];W[hl];B[jl];W[rg];B[mb]
;W[pa]C[Through W124, they make compromise. White obtains some territory, Black is all alive.];B[nr]C[B125 is big. In the endgame fight, Black's advantage is not easy to be overturned.];W[oq];B[or];W[mr];B[mq];W[lr];B[np];W[qf]C[W132: White starts to mess up the situation. However, Black is alive every where on the board. Afterwards, even if there are lot of moves, the outcome of the game has been already decided.];B[kc];W[kb];B[qg]
