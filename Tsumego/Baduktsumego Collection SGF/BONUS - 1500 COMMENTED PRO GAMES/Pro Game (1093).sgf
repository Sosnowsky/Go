Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[Two games of the 7th Ahan Tongshan Cup main event were played at the weekend in Beijing, Dong Yan 7p didn't give a play to his talent and was in a losing situation very early in the game.];W[dd];B[pq];W[oc];B[dp];W[po]
;B[qo];W[qn];B[qp];W[pm];B[pj]LB[pe:a]C[The pincer of B11 is rarely seen, since it is not fitting well with the small point of B1, later on White's press at 'a' is an eye-catching good point.];W[oq];B[pp];W[op];B[oo]LB[or:a]C[From B13 to B23, Black ends in gote, it is definitely not good. Perhaps for Black to simply play hane at 'a' is better.];W[pn]
;B[or];W[nr];B[pr];W[no];B[nq];W[on];B[np];W[qh]LB[pe:a]C[The invasion of W24 is a good point. Now White is thick and now White doesn't want to make the knight's move at 'a'.];B[pe];W[oh];B[nd];W[mc]
;B[nj];W[rj];B[fc];W[md];B[me]LB[cf:a][mi:b][pc:c]TR[pj][nj]C[B33 following White should be the losing cause of this game, since the thicker Black is, the better W24 and W26 are. With B33 Black should take tenuki and double-approach at 'a' to first take profit on the left side. If White makes the knight's move at 'b', Black can make the diagonal at 'c' and sacrifice the two marked stones, this way overall Black is not bad.];W[le];B[lf];W[ke]
;B[mf];W[hc]C[The pincer-attack of W38 is White's ideal configuration.];B[kf];W[je];B[cc];W[dc];B[cd];W[de];B[db];W[eb];B[cb];W[ec];B[cf]
;W[fq]C[Through W50, Black already sinks into passivity very early on.];B[fe]C[B51: Black perhaps realizes his situation is not good, however B51 is still too unreasonable! In the following variation, Black's situation becomes even worse.];W[df];B[cg];W[dg];B[he];W[ch];B[bh];W[bi]C[W56, W58 and W70 are all huge moves, however Black doesn't destroy too much of White's territory but adds one more lonely group, Black is obviously not good.];B[fb];W[fa];B[ga]
;W[ea];B[hb];W[ic];B[dh];W[ci];B[ib];W[jb];B[gc];W[eh];B[gg];W[od];B[eq]LB[oe:a][cn:b]C[The original move of B73 can only be the block at 'a', Black strongly grabs the knight's move at 'b', it is the result of situation judgement, if White again gets to double-approach at 'b', Black also can't compete to win. However the play in the real game is not good either, White is not only thick and White also has lot of territory.]

;W[fi];B[hh]C[Black wants to make life his big group and has to play the crude moves of B99 and B101.];W[hi];B[ia]LB[eg:a]C[But surprisingly with B103 Black doesn't play atari at 'a', this group eventually is still ko-alive, Black already is sentenced to death penalty.];W[fd];B[gd];W[ff];B[gf];W[ee];B[if];W[ie]
