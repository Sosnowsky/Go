Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[I can win this game at the end, indeed luck is one factor. If Cho Hunhyun is a few years younger, he will be very likely the winner of this game.];W[dd];B[pp];W[oc]C[W4 directly approaching the corner is Cho Hunhyun's favorite, clearly knowing opponents had studied it, he still wants to play this way, this is his uniqueness.];B[cp]
;W[eq];B[iq];W[qh];B[pe];W[qk];B[fc];W[cf];B[lc];W[qn];B[pj];W[qj];B[pn]C[B15 and B17 are rarely seen, the purpose is to make White over-concentrated. White takes tenuki, it is correct, here White is already not easy to answer.];W[pm]

;W[mc];B[mb]LB[oc:a]C[B33 initiating a ko is strong and unyielding, but to connect at 'a' is also playable, initiating a ko is not necessarily to Black's advantage, but this is a state of mind in the real game.];W[oc];B[qf];W[pd];B[pg];W[pb];B[od];W[oa];B[md];W[me];B[nc]
;W[pd];B[qc];W[mc];B[qm]LB[ic:a]C[B47: Black can also make two-space extension at 'a', but Black is not reluctant at that time and always wants to play positively.];W[hc];B[pl];W[pk];B[om];W[en];B[cm];W[kq]C[The invasion of W54 is the right move, here if Black encloses completely, White's territory is not enough.]

;B[co];W[dr];B[fo];W[cr];B[mk]LB[dp:a]C[Black makes mistake in the attack following B85. Black should wrap up at 'a' and separate White. White's two groups are both not alive completely, White will be busy to make life, Black can obtain profit by attacking.];W[ni];B[nf];W[mf];B[qg];W[nq];B[lp];W[jq]
;B[np];W[ir];B[hq];W[hr];B[fq];W[ep];B[gr];W[fr];B[hs];W[jr];B[kp]LB[fp:a]C[B103 is a little hasty, now Black perhaps can only connect at 'a' steadily.];W[jp]
;B[jo];W[mp];B[mo];W[mq];B[lo];W[fp];B[gq];W[go]C[Black pushes and cuts with B103, after the hane of W112, Black's shape becomes defective.];B[gn];W[pr];B[fn];W[dl]C[W116 is a good move, pressing Black on the third line, White itself also forms thickness.]
;B[cl];W[dk];B[ck];W[dj];B[cj];W[di];B[dc]LB[ci:a][ch:b][cc:c]C[B123: If Black can answer at 'a' or 'b', after White protects the corner at 123, Black is not good. With B123 Black can strike the corner at 'c'. In the real game, I feel my situation is not optimistic, so I want to live bigger.];W[cc];B[cb];W[db]C[White's sequence following W126 are strong moves! Teacher Cho's strong style is live on the board.]
;B[ec];W[bb];B[cd];W[bc];B[ee];W[ge]C[Through W132, I am already worried that one of two black groups will die.];B[ce];W[hf];B[if];W[gf];B[jg];W[df];B[de]
;W[ih];B[ig];W[ef];B[eb];W[hi];B[fg];W[ff];B[kh];W[ki];B[ji];W[jh];B[kg];W[kj]C[Following W152, White must have miscalculated.]
;B[jc];W[kb];B[jb];W[je]C[White strikes with W154 then again with W156, Teacher Cho thinks he can kill Black.];B[ie];W[jd];B[lb]C[But he overlooks B159, White's loss is heavy!];W[ca];B[gb];W[hb];B[gc];W[hd]
;B[id];W[ho];B[ip];W[hn];B[hm];W[gm];B[hl];W[fm];B[kl];W[qq];B[rb]LB[oi:a][mi:b][ok:c]C[B175 is the losing move! Now Black only needs to atari at 'a', next W 'b' and B 'c', Black's winning position can't be altered.]
;W[ok];B[oi];W[mi];B[rh]LB[nm:a][lk:b]C[In the game, I overlook White's simple and strong tactic at 'a'. If knowing that earlier, with B179, I will simply reinforce at 'b', Black also will win the game.];W[ri];B[ph];W[ik];B[ea];W[nm]LB[ol:a][no:b][mn:c]C[After seeing W184, my brain went blank.

In fact, if I was calm at that time, with B185 I play at 'a', next W 'b' and B 'c', White still can't find a loophole!]
;B[nn]C[With B185 Black gets into a big trouble.];W[ol];B[mm];W[pm];B[fs]C[B189 is mistake again, at that time I want to find a ko threat.];W[re]C[But W190 is alert!];B[qe];W[ml];B[er];W[mn];B[no];W[kn]C[After White separates Black's big group with W192 to W196, Black must live by fighting a ko, the situation has been turned around instantly!]
;B[om];W[ha]LB[ia:a][ma:b]C[In the ko-fighting process, W198 is a mistake, White should make diagonal at 'a', this way later on B 'b' is not effective.];B[gi];W[pm];B[or];W[os];B[om];W[gg]LB[gj:a]C[Furthermore, W203 is almost a "stop" move, White surely should play hane at 'a'.];B[gh]

;W[rm];B[rp]LB[cq:a]C[B233 almost becomes the losing move! Black should capture White's stones in the corner at 'a'. In the real game, I thought I can at least capture one of White's two corners.];W[cq];B[da];W[bi]C[Following W236 White exploits Black, Black incurs a big loss!];B[bj];W[dp];B[be];W[bg];B[bf];W[rg]LB[bq:a]C[W242: White should descend at 'a', Black most likely will lose the game. W242 initiating a ko is an impulsive move.]
;B[qi];W[bq];B[ci];W[ch];B[ai];W[ah]LB[bh:a][dh:b]C[W248 again initiating a ko is the losing move! White perhaps should connect at 'a', the situation is chaotic.

In the real game, since the atari of B 'b' is sente, White's loss is very big, Black establishes superiority.];B[bh];W[fd];B[ed];W[bi];B[lj]

;W[jl]C[White again stirs a ko fight with W280. In the real game, I unexpectedly didn't see it, the good thing is that I have more ko threats, therefore I won the game luckily.];B[ks];W[kr];B[jk];W[aa];B[ac];W[jl];B[qr];W[rr];B[jk];W[bd];B[ad];W[jl]
