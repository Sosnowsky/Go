;W[di];B[ck];W[fd];B[hc]C[B9 seems a little unreasonable.];W[kd]C[White's pincer of W10 is a positive play.];B[dd]LB[cc:a][cb:b][bc:c]C[B11: If White attaches the corner at 'a', after White's hane at 'b', if Black hangs at 11 now, White has the severe tactic of playing atari at 'c'. In the game because Black already has B9, Black can make the simple diagonal of B11.];W[ec]LB[cc:a]C[The simple retreat of W12 is the original move, if White extends at 'a', Black will hane and cut at 12, White is no good.]
;B[cc];W[cb];B[bc]C[With B11, B13 and B15, Black forms a good shape in the corner.];W[he]C[But White gets to cap with W16 and encircle Black's stone B9, Black also can't give up this stone easily, Black's situation is severe.];B[jc];W[kc];B[ie];W[id];B[hd];W[if];B[je];W[jd]
;B[ge];W[hf];B[gd]C[Black fights back with B17 and B19 then gets to stick his head out with B25 and B27.];W[ee];B[gf];W[de]C[W28 and W30 are good moves.];B[dg]LB[cd:a][ed:b][cf:c][eg:d][gh:e]C[B31 is a bad move, Black should first connect at 'a', next W 'b', B 'c', W 'd' and B 'e', escaping his stones at the top is imperative, this way the situation would be still hard to judge.]
;W[cf]C[In the game, White resolutely elects to play the hane of W32.];B[df];W[cg];B[cd];W[ed];B[ch];W[bh];B[dh];W[ci];B[ei];W[eh];B[bg];W[bf]C[Next W442 and W44 are all strong moves.]

;B[hq];W[do];B[cp];W[el];B[fi];W[hh];B[nq]C[Because the board is still very big, with B57, B59 and B63, Black tries to break up the situation.];W[qn];B[ho];W[cl];B[cm];W[eq];B[ep]
;W[dm];B[cn];W[dp];B[cq];W[gq]C[W68 and W74 are classic moves to manage oneself, it is worthwhile for our Go fans to remember and absorb it carefully.];B[fq];W[gp];B[hp];W[er]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.];B[eo];W[hr];B[go]
;W[fp];B[fo];W[fr];B[gl]TR[nq]C[Through B85, although Black captures several white stones, but because the approaching direction of the marked stone is not good, White's shape with W56, W64 and W80 appears smooth and fluid.
