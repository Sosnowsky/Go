;B[fc];W[df];B[pm]C[Black starts to attack White's two stones with B55, otherwise Black's territory will be inadequate.];W[ro];B[rk]LB[pn:a]C[The attachment of B57 seems a little far-fetched, to attach at 'a' is the original move.];W[ql];B[rj];W[pn];B[nm];W[om]LB[pl:a][sn:b][so:c][qr:d]TR[mo]C[White plays wedge with W62 to confront with Black directly, which just fits Black's plan. Although at a glance Black seems very far-fetched, but Black just gets over a crisis, however even if White strengthen at 'a' to make life, but Black is still left with the knight's move at 'b', of course for Black to make the knight's move at 'b' right away is not working, White's block at 'c' is sente, then White can strike at 'd' to fight with Black in a capturing race, but White's marked stone can't be captured, otherwise the knight's move at 'b' will be effective.]

;B[jj];W[pl];B[md]C[B91: Black also has no good way to deal with White's seven stones in the center and has to start another fight somewhere else.];W[mc];B[ld];W[oe];B[od];W[nd];B[ne];W[kb]LB[of:a][qg:b][pi:c][rh:d]C[With just several moves following W98, White ruins this game. With W98 White certainly should extend out at 'a', next the attachment at 'b' is very severe, however Black is also reluctant to sell out all the sente moves at 'c' or 'd', this way White is much better than the real game.]
;B[nf];W[ng];B[ob];W[pg];B[rh]LB[rl:a]C[The exchange of W102 and B103 is also very damaging, for White to strengthen at 'a' becomes very urgent.];W[pe]LB[qb:a][lc:b]TR[oe]C[However in order to be able to extend at 'a', White incurs loss first by W94 and W104, White's loss outweighs his gain, because a dead group is left on the right side, even if it is such a big move of pushing at 'b', White has to ignore it, White clearly fails.];B[qe];W[oc]

;B[in];W[io];B[jn];W[hn];B[im];W[hm];B[il];W[em]LB[fl:a]C[The knight's move at 'a' is the last losing move, White can only make the knight's move at 'a', this way the situation is still relatively complicated.];B[gl];W[hl];B[gk]C[White obviously overlooks Black's strong moves of B127 and B129.]
