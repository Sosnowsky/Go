;B[ci]C[To prepare for this final match, Zhou Heyang has studied very hard in the opening, and Lee Changho's opening in this game with B1 to B7 is Heyang's main study topic.];W[od];B[mc];W[ob]C[W8 and W10, these two moves, are also prepared.];B[pf];W[ne];B[jc];W[qh];B[ph];W[pi];B[oh];W[qe]
;B[re];W[pd];B[qi];W[rd];B[rf];W[qc];B[qj]C[Through B25, it forms a not so popular joseki, as to this variation, Heyang also commented before, he thinks White is relatively easier to play.

];W[de]C[W26: White immediately breaks up Black's moyo.];B[fd];W[cc];B[cb];W[cd]
;B[cf]LB[bb:a]C[B31: The attack of B31 is a strong move, better than the extension at 'a'.];W[df];B[cg];W[fe];B[gd];W[db]C[W34 and W36 are a good sequence to fix the shape.];B[eb];W[ec];B[da];W[ed];B[fb]
;W[eh];B[dk]C[Through B43, White handles the situation very beautifully.];W[co]C[With the exchange of W44 and B45, White obtains some territory, but it has a very big impact on the group in the upper left corner, perhaps Heyang is not worried about Lee Changho's attack.];B[dn];W[bn];B[bm];W[qk]C[The attachment of W48 is a good move, taking some advantage by using Black's weakness.];B[pk];W[pl];B[rk];W[ql];B[rl]
;W[qn]C[Through B54, the pattern is set as imagined, so far, White is leading in territory, the offense and defense in the upper left corner will be the key for the game.];B[gg]C[B55: Black starts to attack, this attacking point is very cunning. Now starts the real test for Heyang.];W[gh];B[fh];W[fi];B[fg];W[dh];B[ch]C[In the study room, Chinese players think White is a little painful, now looking back, the earlier diagonal of W44  is perhaps questionable.];W[ej];B[gi];W[gj];B[hh]
;W[dj]LB[ij:a]C[W66: White should jump to 'a'.];B[cj];W[ek];B[hj]C[The tiger's move of B69 is a huge move! In this local variation, Black achieves a big success by attacking, White's situation is not good.];W[gk];B[bo];W[bp];B[an];W[dl];B[ck];W[hk]
;B[ok]C[The extension of B77 seems slow, playing at the lower side appears bigger.];W[kq]C[Now the situation is still relatively close, Black is thicker.];B[ij];W[ik]C[After this move, it is time for lunch break.];B[jk];W[jl];B[kl]C[The direction of B81 and B83 is to many player's surprise, this kind of situation is very complicated.];W[kk];B[jj];W[jm]LB[km:a]C[As to W86, some pros think White can atari at 'a', but the aji inside White's territory is no good.]
;B[lq]LB[ll:a]C[B87: For Black to extend at 'a' is common, the play in the game is active.];W[lp];B[ll];W[ln];B[fo];W[le]LB[en:a]C[The situation enters into a very difficult time. B91 and W92 are all huge points. With W92 for White to cross cut at 'a' is a desperate play, but the study result shows White is more dangerous.];B[kp]C[B93 probes White, it is excellent timing.];W[jq];B[pr]LB[pq:a][qq:b][qr:c]C[B95: For Black to attach at 'a' is better, next W 'b' and B 'c', Black is easier to make life.]
;W[qq];B[qr];W[nr]C[W98 is a good forcing move.];B[ep];W[eq];B[rq];W[rp];B[pq];W[qp];B[sq]C[Black makes life painfully from B101 to B105.];W[mp]LB[nq:a][ol:b][rs:c]C[W106 is loose, if White loses this game, this will be the losing move, White should extend at 'a', Black can only live by playing at 'c', then White can attach at 'b'. This makes a big difference in points, White has the hope of winning this game.]
;B[nq];W[mq];B[or];W[np];B[rm]C[B111: Black gets to live on this side, White incurs a big loss.];W[go];B[gn];W[eo];B[fn];W[fp];B[do];W[hn];B[hm]
;W[in];B[lg];W[ol];B[nl];W[nm];B[ml]C[Through B125, Black is leading in the game.];W[cp];B[gm];W[be];B[qm]LB[bc:a]C[B129 is hasty, if Black hanes at 'a', Black already can win the game by a small margin. In the game, Black gives White a chance.];W[pn]
;B[pm];W[om];B[kn];W[km];B[lm];W[em];B[en];W[il];B[mn]C[The ko fight following B139 is to White's advantage.];W[lo];B[on];W[nn];B[oo]
;W[no];B[op]C[In the study room, pros have showed a lot of variations, but it is all to White's advantage.];W[oq];B[mf];W[me];B[nq];W[cl];B[bl];W[oq];B[fj];W[fk];B[nq]LB[rj:a]C[White's ko threat of cutting at 'a' will make Black very miserable.]
;W[nk]C[W156 seeking ko threat is a mistake, the exchange in the game is not White's best result.];B[oq]C[Now the situation is again very close, Black seems to have more chance to win.
];W[nj];B[lj];W[pj];B[qf];W[kb]C[W162 is a questionable move.];B[kc];W[lb];B[lc];W[mb];B[ke]C[Black gets to play at 167, Black's chance of winning is bigger.]

;B[ap];W[aq];B[ao];W[bq];B[nc]LB[aj:a]C[B185 is a fatal mistake, this move is worth 3 points in sente, but White's move at 'a' (W186) is worth 5 points in sente, in this exchange Black incurs a 2-point loss!];W[aj];B[ak];W[af];B[cm];W[nb];B[mr];W[lr]
;B[di]C[B193 is not good! Giving White a chance! White takes 1+ points advantage.];W[ef];B[bc];W[bd];B[ab]C[Black will win the game by a very small margin.];W[ei];B[ge];W[fc];B[gc];W[mh];B[lh];W[ms]
;B[db];W[dd];B[fl];W[el];B[lf];W[gf];B[hf];W[li]C[W212 is a clever move.];B[mi];W[lk];B[mk];W[mj];B[kj]
;W[ni];B[ki];W[os];B[nf];W[ps];B[qs];W[ns]C[White's small loss is already decided.];B[rr];W[mm];B[pe];W[se]C[W228 is a good move.];B[qd]
;W[sc];B[sf];W[oe];B[of];W[ia];B[ha];W[ja];B[qe]LB[bf:a]C[B237 is inexplicable, if Black loses, this will be the losing move, now White wins by half point, with B237 Black should squeeze at 'a'.];W[sd];B[nh];W[mi];B[oc]
;W[pc];B[ld];W[mg];B[bf];W[ae];B[ng];W[ac];B[ad]C[White has many ko threats in the lower right corner.];W[bb];B[ba];W[ac];B[pb];W[qb]
;B[ad]C[Now only if he sees clear how to find ko threats in the lower right corner, Heyang will win the game.];W[hi];B[ii];W[ac];B[rc];W[rb];B[ad];W[ss];B[sp];W[ac];B[sb];W[sa];B[ad]
