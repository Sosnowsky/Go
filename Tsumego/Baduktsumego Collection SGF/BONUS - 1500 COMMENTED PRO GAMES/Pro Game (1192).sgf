;B[bo];W[cr];B[bd];W[cc];B[ci];W[qj];B[qi]C[The attachment of B23 is to seek efficiency.];W[pi]LB[ri:a][rh:b][qh:c][rg:d]C[The upper-hane of W24 is fine, but at this situation for White to hane at 'a' is better, since if Black plays double-hane at 'b', then W 'c', B24 and W 'd', Black is not favorable in the ladder and can't capture W22 in a ladder.];B[qh]
;W[pj];B[ph];W[pc];B[qc];W[oc];B[qd];W[md]LB[lc:a][qm:b][kc:c][oh:d]C[The knight's move of W32 is a very thoughtful move. If White makes two-space extension at 'a', Black will make two-space extension at 'b' for sure, in the real game, B 'c' is also a good point, instead Black is not easy to make choice. Besides, W32 is in high position, White's hane at 'd' is also very good, therefore in the game it leads to the questionable move of W33.];B[ni]LB[qm:a][kc:b][nh:c][oh:d]C[In fact, now Black has three choices: one, to extension at 'a'; two, to invade at 'b', if Black wants to stick head out, for Black to jump at 'c' is also playable, next B 'b' and 'c' become miai, Black is also not bad. In the game, White is left with the cut at 'd', Black is not good.]

;W[re];B[sg];W[pe]C[Through W60, the situation is also to White's advantage.];B[rj];W[pp];B[pq];W[ql];B[rk];W[op];B[np]LB[nq:a]C[Black's sequence following B67 are losing moves! At any rate, Black can't elect to play this joseki. With B67 Black should extend at 'a', this way although Black's situation is also not good, but the game is still long. In the end Black's big dragon suddenly dies.];W[qq]
