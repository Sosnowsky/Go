;B[jp]LB[pg:a][mc:b]TR[qd][pe]C[B19 making a big extension is originally just fine, however Black can also consider first to jump at 'a', first dealing with the two marked stones B1 and B7 and also aiming at the invasion at 'b'.];W[ne];B[pg];W[ph];B[nf];W[of]LB[oe:a][og:b]C[The hane of W24 is very strong and unyielding, if Black simply cuts at 'a' White will block at 'b', Black is a little far-fetched in the fight.¡£];B[nd]LB[og:a][ng:b][mf:c][pf:d]C[If Black blocks at 'a', then W 'b', B 'c' and W 'd', Black is also very difficult, therefore in the game, the simple clamp of B25 is a good move to get out of crisis.]
;W[od];B[oe];W[me];B[ng];W[oh];B[og];W[rf]LB[qf:a][pf:b][re:c][pb:d][ob:e]C[The knight's move of W32 is inexplicable. White certainly should strike at 'a', if Black takes at 'b', White can make the diagonal at 'c', this way when Black crosscuts at 'd', even if White tolerates by playing the clamp at 'e', Black would still have no eye shape. In the game, Black can capture two white stones, not only making life and also gaining some points.];B[pb]

;W[nm];B[mn];W[gp]C[In the game, Black extends out with B83 and White captures with W84, each side gains some profit.];B[om];W[pn];B[he]C[B87 serves as a ladder breaker.];W[hg]LB[hc:a]C[White certainly can't answer at 'a'.];B[hc]C[However the jump of B89 is very brave, White is also not easy to capture Black's two stones B87 and B89.];W[id];B[ec]
;W[fc];B[fb];W[gb];B[eb];W[gc];B[ed];W[ee];B[cb];W[de];B[dc]C[Black's handling sequence from B91 to B101 is not bad, after this variation, Black is already leading in territory.];W[nl];B[fe]LB[km:a]C[The cut of B103 is the losing cause of this game. Black should simply hane and capture at 'a', Black is favorable for the game.]
;W[ff];B[ge];W[hb];B[gg];W[gh];B[fg];W[fh];B[eg];W[dg]LB[ln:a]C[Although Black destroys White's territory of about 15 points with the sequence following B103, but Black has lost half move by the exchange of B111 and W112, the most important is, if Black ends in gote, White gets to escape four stone by playing at 'a', Black's loss clearly outweighs his gain.

Now Black should take tenuki and hane at 'a', this way Black would still have a chance of winning. if White pushes and cuts at 'b', then B 'c', W 'd', B 'e', W121, B 'f', W 'g' and B 'h', Black is alive (see var a), in the process with W 'g' if White crawls at 'i', Black can also live by attaching at 'j'.];W[cg];B[bg];W[bf]
;B[be];W[dk]C[The attachment of W126 is a good move!];B[ck];W[bh];B[af];W[cj];B[dj];W[bj];B[di];W[ek];B[bi];W[ej];B[cl]
;W[ln]C[White first makes himself thick then doubles up at 138, the situation has been turned around, Black already has no chance of winning.
