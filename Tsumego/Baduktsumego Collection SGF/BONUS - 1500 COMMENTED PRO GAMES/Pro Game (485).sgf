;B[po];W[qi];B[fq];W[lq]C[W10 is a bad move, it helps Black to double approach the corner with B11. Only when you can take an empty corner or grab a good point, otherwise nobody wants to be double approached. However Cho Hunyun doesn't ask for any price and allows Rui Naiwei to double approach, it is indeed hard to understand. Zhou Heyang 8p clearly indicates that he and many players all like to play Black and feel that Black's speed is faster and Black's shape is also very thick.
];B[cn]C[Through 11, although only several moves were played in the opening, but Black seems to have already taken advantage. The reason is that the two two-space extensions of W6-W8 and W4-W10 appear "senile". In the opening, both sides want to stress on speed and grab big points, however nobody likes to play the slow one-space or two-space extensions. However Cho Hunhyun ingores Black's approaching move at 9 and elects to play the two-space extension in the lower right, not sure whether it is a special strategy, or he may think that the game will be decided in the middle-game fight, to grab big points or play two-space extensions in the opening just serves as a foil.];W[fp];B[gp];W[fo];B[dq];W[eq];B[er];W[ep]
;B[gr];W[cq];B[dr];W[go];B[hp];W[dk]C[The sequence from W12 to W24 is a joseki in handicap games, Black has obtained territory, however you still can't say that White has controlled the outside.];B[ci];W[ho];B[ip];W[nc];B[qf];W[fc];B[df]
;W[cc];B[dc];W[db];B[dm]LB[eb:a][cd:b]C[B35 is severe. Based on what happens in the lower left corner, Black then consider whether to play the hane at 'a' or strengthen at 'b'. Generally, if Black invades White's territory, Black would always come under fierce attack. However when Rui Naiwei invades White's territory, not only she is not subject to attack, instead she threatens White, this proves that the joseki that Cho Hunhyun elects to play in the lower left corner is questionable.];W[ej];B[fm];W[hm];B[fk];W[eh];B[cg];W[gi]
;B[hk];W[jn];B[fj];W[fi];B[ij];W[eb]C[W48 is too greedy. White's one dragon on the left is not alive yet, White has another dragon in the lower left corner which is not alive either. White should look after the left side group or the lower left group. But Cho Hunhyun turns a blind eye to both of them, and elects to play at 48 to take advantage, it is really unreasonable!];B[cd];W[bc];B[ge];W[hf];B[lp];W[mp];B[kp]
;W[mo];B[kn];W[km];B[ln]C[Although the sequence from B53 to B59 is a way of attacking, but Zhou Heyang thinks if B55 was played at 56 it would be more severe.];W[qr]C[W60 is a tough move. Now White on the left and in the lower right corner are all dangerous, but Cho Hunhyun 9p still wants to take some advantages. This equals to tell Rui Naiwei: if you can kill one of my dragons, you win, otherwise you are going to lose!

;W[cp];B[bn];W[en];B[em];W[cr];B[hg];W[ig];B[fn];W[lm];B[mm]LB[mn:a]C[With the sequence from B61 to B77, Black starts to kill White's dragon, White is on the verge of death. Zhou Heyang thinks, the main reason for this is W68. White should first press at 76 to probe Black. If Black retreats at 'a', then White connects at 68; If Black plays the hane at 77, then White starts a ko at 69. White can get out of this dangerous situation by using the ko threat at 'a'.

;B[mk]C[B93 is a brilliant move. Rui Naiwei can win the champion by this clever move in this intense final match, it is indeed commendable.];W[gl];B[ek];W[hj];B[ik];W[mj];B[io];W[lk];B[ll];W[gk];B[gj];W[hl];B[hi]
;W[ml];B[hj]C[Through B107, Black has killed the left-side group successfully.];W[kl];B[mn]C[B109: After Black connects back, Black already has achieved a big victory.
