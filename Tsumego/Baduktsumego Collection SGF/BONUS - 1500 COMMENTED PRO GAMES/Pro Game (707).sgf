Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[pd]C[In the game 3 of 31st Meijin Title, the defending champion Cho U 9p defeated Takao Shinji 9p by resignation, but still trailing the series by 1:2.];W[dd];B[pq];W[dq];B[do];W[po]
;B[pm];W[mp]C[As to B7, W8 is rarely seen.];B[pp]C[B9 is the right answer, in my memory, White's result is not good, does Cho U have new study?];W[oo];B[qo];W[qn];B[pn];W[rn];B[rp]LB[qp:a][qk:b][no:c]C[B15 is never seen before, for Black to play the sequence of B 'a', W 'b' and B 'c' is relatively better.]
;W[ql];B[qj]LB[no:a][op:b]C[When B17, if Black plays at 'a', White can escape at 'b', Black is not good.];W[pl];B[nn];W[op];B[nr];W[ok]LB[nl:a][mn:b]C[W22 is unique, normally White will stick the head out quickly at 'a', in the game White puts importance on the tactic of W 'b', which is tasteful.];B[nl]
;W[nk];B[ml];W[mn];B[kl];W[jp];B[lj];W[pi]C[W30: White grabs the good point with W30, locally White can fight.];B[qi]LB[pj:a][ol:b][qh:c]C[B31 and B 'a' are heavy, B 'b' becomes sente and is also valuable, but Black incurs loss first, for Black to jump at 'a' is light and nimble.];W[pg]
;B[pj];W[oi];B[rg];W[sp]LB[rq:a]C[W36 is a clever move! If Black retreats at 'a', White will take two-point advantage.];B[sq]LB[rq:a]C[In the game, Black counterattacks strongly, but if thinking carefully, with B37 Black still should tolerate at 'a'.];W[or];B[oq];W[nq];B[mq];W[np]
;B[pr]LB[mr:a]TR[qo]C[B43: Black has no other choice, if B 'a', then White will play at 43, Black's key stone B11 (the marked stone) will be captured.];W[mr]C[From W38 and W44, White takes a huge profit.];B[ol];W[ro];B[qp];W[pk];B[rk];W[rl];B[os];W[li]LB[qf:a]C[W52 again is tesuji, if Black answers, White will strengthen the cut in sente then play diagonal at 'a', Black is not good.]
;B[qf];W[ki]C[W54: White takes control of the center, White's situation is vivid.];B[kj];W[mi];B[lq];W[lr];B[kq];W[jq];B[kr];W[jr];B[ij];W[co];B[dp]LB[cn:a]C[B65 is wrong direction, since White has plentiful eye shape and is not afraid of attack. Black should play at 'a' instead, allowing White to play on the lower side.]

;B[er];W[dr]C[After White handles well the lower side with W80, White's situation is favorable.];B[fc]LB[cf:a][ji:b]C[B81 is not good, with W82 White certainly will not answer at 'a'. For Black to play at 'a' and take control of center is relatively better.];W[hc];B[cc];W[dc];B[cd];W[de];B[db];W[eb]
;B[cb];W[ec];B[cf];W[nc];B[pb];W[ii];B[hi];W[ih];B[hj];W[oc];B[pc];W[oe]C[Through W100, White suddenly forms a big territory at the top, Black's situation has deteriorated.];B[fb]C[B101: Black must invade in order to have a chance to win.]
;W[fa]C[White's sequence following W102 is simple and powerful!];B[mb];W[df];B[ce];W[nb];B[hb];W[ic];B[ib];W[jc];B[jb];W[lc];B[kc];W[lb]
;B[ge];W[gf]C[Especially with W116, Black has no way to deal with it.];B[jd];W[gd];B[fd];W[fe];B[he];W[gb];B[ff];W[ee];B[id];W[gc];B[hg]
;W[kd];B[ke];W[ld]C[Through W130, White gets to defend the upper side, White is still leading.];B[ds];W[kp];B[ls];W[jm];B[cr];W[cq];B[br];W[cj];B[fg];W[dm]
;B[fo];W[bg]C[W142 is huge.];B[dj]C[Next if playing endgame normally, Black is difficult to give komi.];W[bi];B[kn]C[B143 and B145: Black wants to obtain the maximum profit by attacking White at the bottom, but Black selects the wrong target since the beginning.];W[km];B[ln];W[lm];B[mm];W[jn]C[Following W150, White handles easily the big dragon, the difference between them has been enlarged instead.];B[mo]
