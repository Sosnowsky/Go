;W[eq];B[dp];W[dq];B[co];W[cq];B[fp];W[gq]C[From B5 to B13, Black forms a thick shape. Black is willing to end in gote and tries to gain mastery by striking after the opponent has struck, this is common style of Japanese players.];B[dn];W[fc]C[W14: White seeks steadiness.];B[dc];W[ic];B[kc]C[But Black forces with B17, not allowing White to settle easily. Once it forms a fight here, Black's thickness in the lower left corner will be put into use.]
;W[oc]LB[nd:a]C[Therefore, with W18 for White to simply approach at 'a' is better.];B[pc];W[nd]C[After W18, the diagonal of W20 looks weird.];B[oe];W[jd]LB[pb:a]C[As to the knight's move of B21, with W22 at any rate White should play hane at 'a'.];B[od]C[In the game, Black gets to squeeze with B23. In the corner, it equals to White takes tenuki with W20, Black hangs with B23, White is clearly not good.];W[kd]C[Following W24 White doesn't know how to continue.];B[ld]
;W[lc];B[mc];W[lb];B[md];W[mb];B[nb];W[kb]C[But in the game, White ends in gote, which is clearly unacceptable.];B[qk]C[Black takes the big point with the extension of B33, Black establishes superiority very early on. 

It seems Kono Rin's state in this game is very questionable.];W[cm]C[White turns to fight in the lower left corner with W34.];B[bp];W[bq]LB[cj:a]C[But when B35, White is clearly over-zealous with W36. White can only make two-space extension at 'a' and tangle with Black slowly.]
;B[cj]C[Black gets to attack with the pincer of B37, White can't possibly attack Black.];W[dm]LB[el:a]C[W38: White must fly out at 'a' and handle lightly.];B[bn];W[bm]C[W38 are W40 are hasty moves.];B[fm]C[After the cap of B41, White completely sinks into passivity.];W[dk];B[fk];W[fj];B[gj];W[ej]
;B[gk]C[B43, B45 and B47: Black's calculation is accurate.];W[ch]TR[cj]C[White unexpectedly can't do nothing about B37 (the marked stone).];B[di];W[bj]C[White's sequence following W50 is miscalculation. There is also possibility that White tests whether Yamashita can answer correctly.];B[bk]C[However, Black answers all correctly following B51.];W[ci];B[dj];W[ck];B[bi];W[eh]
;B[dh];W[dg];B[aj];W[cg];B[ek];W[bh];B[bj];W[ei];B[eg];W[fg];B[ef];W[fh];B[al]C[B69 is good move, it leads to a ko.]
;W[am]C[This ko is heavy for White and light for Black.];B[em];W[bl];B[dl];W[cl];B[an];W[ak];B[fq];W[ai];B[er]C[Through B77 and B79, Black captures the corner in exchange, the game is over.];W[lq];B[nq]
;W[qn];B[no];W[pr];B[or];W[pq];B[pm];W[pn];B[om];W[gr];B[fr];W[jq];B[qm]C[B87 and B93 are slow moves.];W[oh]
;B[mh];W[qh];B[pi];W[of];B[qf];W[oi];B[ph];W[pg];B[pj];W[mg];B[qg];W[lh];B[mi]
;W[li];B[lj];W[mj];B[nj];W[mk];B[ni];W[lg];B[kj];W[lo];B[on]C[The following B87, B93 and B117 are all big slow moves!];W[eb];B[db]C[But after the exchange, the difference between them is indeed too big, White still suffers a big loss in the end.]
