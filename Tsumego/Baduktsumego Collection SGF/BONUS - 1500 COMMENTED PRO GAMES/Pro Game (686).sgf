Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[Recently Zhou Ruiyang's state is not good. In terms of game content, he still haven't adjusted back to his normal state.];W[dd]C[Hope he can come back to his early braveness and power and play better in the following games.];B[fc];W[pp];B[cf]
;W[ee];B[cc]C[The opening up to B7 is rarely seen.];W[dq]C[W8 apparently entices Black to approach the corner with B9.];B[do]C[However, Black falls into trap with B9, it is still fine, each side gets what they want.];W[dg];B[dc];W[co];B[cn];W[cp];B[dn];W[fq];B[dj]
;W[cg];B[be];W[fh];B[fj]LB[ci:a][bl:b]C[B21: Black can also consider to make diagonal at 'a', this way Black can guard against White's invasion at 'b', its value is huge.];W[nc];B[pc];W[jd];B[hd]LB[gd:a]C[B25 is important, here Black can't be seal off completely by W 'a'.];W[hh]
;B[qn];W[nq];B[rp];W[qq];B[qk];W[ne];B[pg]LB[ci:a]C[As to W32, B33 looks normal, but in fact this is the reason why Black is falling behind in the opening. At any rate, with B33 Black should grab the vital point at 'a', there is no big problem on the right side.];W[bl]C[W34 is alert!];B[bm];W[dl];B[el]
;W[dk];B[ek];W[cj];B[di];W[ci];B[cl];W[ck];B[dm]C[Through B45, Black is not happy but can only play this way. In this local variation, White destroys all Black's territory and also obtains some eye shape for himself, White gains a lot and establishes superiority at one stroke.];W[fd]C[W46 is an asking move.];B[gd]LB[gc:a]C[B47 is too impulsive, Black is left with a can-not-lose ko. Later on Black's play will be restricted. Black should tolerate at 'a'.];W[fo]LB[go:a]C[W48: For White to play at 'a' seems better.]
;B[fm];W[hn]C[After W50, Black's big group is being threatened, Black's situation is very passive.];B[bo];W[bp];B[bk];W[cm];B[al];W[bf]LB[cl:a][ch:b]C[W56 is tesuji, if White connects at 'a', Black can wedge at 'b'.];B[bh]LB[bg:a]C[B57 is local tesuji. However, for Black to play atari at 'a' and tie up White's big group is better.]
;W[ce]C[Next Black captures several white stones, but due to the addition of W58, the ko at top is already worry-free for White.];B[ch];W[dh];B[bi];W[ec];B[eb];W[fb];B[ed];W[ei];B[ej];W[ec];B[gc];W[db]
;B[ed];W[bj];B[cl];W[ec];B[ea];W[qm]LB[ql:a]C[W76: White can also consider to play ko threat at 'a', this way Black hopefully can destroy Black at one stroke.];B[pm];W[rn];B[rm];W[ql];B[rl];W[pl]
;B[pk];W[ol];B[ro];W[pn];B[qo]C[In the game, B87 is clever move to tolerate, although only one ko threat is enough, White doesn't have chance to initiate the ko.];W[po];B[ed];W[km]C[However, with W88 and W90, White forms huge territory at bottom, White's advantage is also very obvious.];B[md];W[nd];B[kd]LB[kc:a]C[B93: Normally Black will make knight at 'a'.]
;W[ke];B[le];W[kc];B[lc]C[It again forms a ko, Black plays desperately while in an unfavorable situation.];W[ld]C[As to this, White certainly has nothing to be afraid of.];B[ep];W[fp];B[kd];W[pe];B[qe];W[ld];B[eq]
;W[er];B[kd];W[pd];B[qb];W[ld];B[dr];W[cr];B[kd];W[rc];B[qc];W[ld]C[Afterwards, Gu Li responds properly.];B[gn];W[ho]
;B[kd];W[lf];B[kf];W[ld];B[fr];W[ds];B[kd];W[je];B[mf];W[lg];B[me];W[lb]C[W120 and W130 are two vital hane points.];B[jc]
;W[ld];B[mc];W[mb];B[kd];W[kb];B[mg];W[ic];B[lh]C[Through B139, Black gains nothing.];W[kg]LB[ok:a]C[W140: White can also consider to turn at 'a', this way it is simpler to play.];B[ob];W[nb]
;B[ml]C[The fight following B143 is also absolutely to White's advantage.];W[ok];B[kl];W[lm];B[jm];W[ll];B[jn]C[B149: Black destroys some white territory, but Black's outside also becomes thin.];W[jl];B[il];W[kk];B[jk];W[jp]
;B[oj];W[pf];B[qg];W[og];B[nk];W[nm];B[ko];W[kp];B[oh];W[qf];B[rf];W[ph]C[W166 is the fatal attack and very beautiful tesuji!];B[qh]
;W[nh];B[oi];W[ng]C[W170: White breaks through, the game for Black is as good as lost.];B[mh];W[jj];B[ni];W[ec];B[go];W[hp];B[ed];W[rg];B[rh];W[ec]
;B[kl];W[lj];B[ki];W[jl];B[ik];W[kj];B[jf];W[fa];B[ed];W[jg];B[if];W[ec];B[jb]
