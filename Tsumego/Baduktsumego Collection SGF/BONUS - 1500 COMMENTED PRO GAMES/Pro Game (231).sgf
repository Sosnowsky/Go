Translation:GoGameWorld.];B[pd]C[Black is Kobayashi Satoru 9p.];W[dp]C[White is Lee Sedol 7p.];B[pp]C[In the quarter-final of 16th Fujitus Cup, Japanese Kobayashi Satoru leads in the opening but the game was turned around by Korean Lee Sedol, and Kobayshi failed to advance to the semi-final.];W[dd]
;B[fq];W[cn];B[fc]C[B5 and B7 are Kobayashi's favorite plays.];W[hc];B[mc]C[B9 is also a new trend, this kind of opening stresses on speed.];W[eq]LB[ec:a][fd:b]C[The common play for W10 is to make the diagonal-bump at 'a' on the left or press at 'b'.];B[fp];W[ip]LB[jp:a][kq:b]C[W12: For White to make the three-space extension at 'a' would be better, in the game, Black is left with inevitable good point of clamping at 'b', White feels a little dissatisfied.]
;B[kq];W[jo];B[fm];W[lp];B[mq];W[dm];B[in];W[km];B[il];W[kk];B[hd]C[After Black presses out at 23, Black's opening is successful.];W[id];B[he]
;W[gc];B[fd];W[db]C[The jump of W28 is Lee Sedol's style, White wants to keep both sides.];B[fb];W[jc];B[de];W[ce];B[cf];W[cd];B[ee];W[cg]LB[bf:a]C[W36 is unreasonable, playing the hane at 'a' is the proper move.]
;B[ie];W[je];B[jf]LB[bf:a]C[In the game, B37 and B39 are absolute sente moves, then the descent at 'a' is severe.];W[ke];B[bf];W[df];B[dg];W[ef];B[ff];W[eg];B[dh];W[fg]
;B[bg]LB[be:a]C[B49 is a very "vicious" move, without the sente blocking move at 'a', White's corner would be ko-alive.];W[ei];B[ij]LB[hi:a]C[B51: Black can consider to make the knight's move at 'a', White is difficult to separate Black, if Black can link together his two groups, Black's advantage would be obvious.];W[ii]C[The attachment of W52 is a good move! This play shows Lee Sedol's sharpness in close contact fights.];B[kf];W[lf];B[ji];W[hi];B[ig]C[B57: Black has no choice but to reinforce.]
;W[jj]C[Being able to cut at 58, White already has retrieved the situation.];B[le];W[ld];B[me];W[md];B[kd];W[jd];B[nd];W[lc];B[lb];W[kc];B[lg];W[ki]LB[cj:a][di:b][dj:c][bi:d][ej:e][be:f]C[Although W70 and W72 are very thick plays, but it is too slow! White should make the knight's move at 'a', then B 'b', W 'c', B 'd' and W 'e', though White ends in gote, but later on, the block at 'f' becomes sente, so this move is quite valuable.]
;B[cj];W[jh];B[nb];W[ib];B[mf]TR[fq][fm]C[B73 and B75 are huge moves. Now White puts all his bet on killing the black stones in the center, however it is not that easy.];W[ho];B[hq];W[lq];B[lr]LB[iq:a][io:b]TR[ho]C[B79: For Black to crawl at 'a' is simpler and clearer, if White stands at 79, then Black can squeeze and capture the marked white stone, this way Black's advantage would be clear.]
;W[jr];B[kp];W[mp];B[kr];W[iq];B[nq];W[fo];B[cq];W[er];B[ko]C[In the game, although the push at 89 is also very big, but White has also captured the black stones, so both sides still keep the balance in territory.];W[jn];B[cp];W[do]
;B[ej]C[The attachment of B93 is a good move, if all center black stones are captured, this would be too big.
];W[di];B[dj];W[ch];B[bh];W[ci];B[bi];W[fi];B[cl];W[qj];B[bb];W[bn];B[ae]LB[ab:a][qi:b]C[B105 is a big-slow move! Although White can attach under at 'a' to make life with a ko, but this can't compare to 'b', which is much bigger.]
;W[rf]C[After White first strikes at 106, Black is already not optimistic.];B[rd];W[rp];B[qn]LB[qk:a][qi:b]TR[rp]C[The sequence after B109 to settle the shape are losing moves! Black should first play at either 'a' or 'b', see how White answers, then consider how to handle the marked white stone. This way the outcome of the game is still hard to imagine.];W[rn];B[qm];W[qq];B[pq];W[qo]
;B[po];W[qr]TR[rf][qj]C[Through W116, White lives very comfortably, however Black doesn't have any strong maneuver to attack the two marked white stones.];B[qg];W[rg];B[qi];W[ri];B[rh];W[sh];B[qh];W[rk];B[rm]

;B[nk];W[ol];B[on];W[mj]C[In the game, Black has totally failed in the attack from B117 to W142, not only Black hasn't gained any advantage, but also White has taken the opportunity and made some territory, Black already doesn't have enough territory to give White komi.];B[ql];W[qk];B[mm];W[nm];B[mn];W[ml];B[fk];W[nn];B[no]
