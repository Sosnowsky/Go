;B[dp];W[dq];B[co];W[fq];B[bp];W[cq];B[ci];W[ck];B[dn];W[ek];B[go]C[The opening is relatively steady.];W[de]C[After one-space high approach of W18, Lee Changho 9p went into deep thinking.]
;B[hq]C[After thinking for a long time, Black elects to make knight of B19 and pressure White in the lower-left corner. Generally speaking, White should defend the corner.];W[dh]LB[ei:a]C[White elects to play the shoulder-hit of W20, since Zhou Heyang thinks if White answers in the corner, after Black jumps to 'a', White is difficult. In fact, this way the situation is simpler and White's situation is not bad. Lee Changho didn't act immediately in the lower-left corner and instead went into deep thinking again.];B[bq]C[B21: Lee Changho decides to act right away in the corner.];W[hr];B[gr]C[The cut of B23 is a surprising move and very strong.];W[gq];B[ir];W[hp];B[iq];W[gp]
;B[nq]C[Black didn't hesitate to approach the corner with B29.];W[qn]C[W30: White defends the corner and Black obtains sente, Black may want to play at the top.];B[cg]C[The jump of B31 is again after deep thinking and unexpected as well.];W[dg];B[cf];W[df];B[ce];W[ch]C[With the push of W36, White aims to play thickness. Here the variation is relatively complicated.];B[dd];W[bg];B[dl]C[The peep of B39 is very good timing.]
;W[bn]C[The strike of W40 is the vital point.];B[bo];W[cm];B[dk]C[W42 and B43 are strong moves. Lee Changho starts to attack White in the lower-left corner.];W[dm];B[em];W[el];B[dj];W[bi]C[The hane of W48 is strong. It leads to a fight, both sides have no room to retreat. Black incurs a big loss in territory, Black's aji in the upper-left corner is also very bad.];B[ej];W[fj];B[fi]C[After B49 and B51, White is quite difficult.]
;W[gk];B[eh]C[B53: Black aims to connect the left side.

After this move, it is time for noon break.];W[gm];B[fm];W[hj]C[The tiger's move of W56 is resilient and better than one-space jump.];B[bj];W[bk];B[ai];W[cj];B[bh];W[di];B[ei]C[Black connects with B63 resolutely. Here I also feel Lee Changho's braveness, his play looks very confident.]
;W[bi]C[White takes ko with W64 to fix shape using ko fight.];B[gn];W[hm]C[The extension of W66 is simple and clear.];B[ci];W[cd]C[W68: If Black counterattacks, it will lead to a huge ko fight. It seems an exchange will result.];B[ag];W[bi]C[White takes the ko with W70 and continues to resist. However, White is difficult to resist using ko threats in the lower-left corner. If the exchange of lower-left and upper-right happens, Black succeeds. But if in the process of ko fight, Black plays damaging ko threats, Black will not be favorable any more.];B[ip]C[Black uses the extension of B71 as ko threat.];W[ho];B[ci]C[Black takes the ko with B73, White doesn't seem to have any good ko threat. Black is favorable.]
;W[fn]C[The cut of W74 is a big damaging ko threat. In order to win the ko fight, Zhou Heyang has no other choices.];B[fl];W[fk];B[fo];W[bi];B[hn];W[io];B[ci];W[gl];B[en]C[Black takes with B83, White is difficult.];W[bi];B[in]
;W[jo];B[ci]C[Black takes the ko again, White needs to find proper ko threat.];W[bf]C[W88 is big damaging ko threat.];B[be]C[B89: The ko fight becomes heavier and bigger. If Black stops now, Black will be in a big advantage for the game.];W[bi];B[kp]C[B91: Black turns around.];W[ah]C[White wins the ko fight by using big damaging move, Black obtains huge territory in the upper-left corner.];B[ln]C[B93: Black wants to kill White at the bottom, White is very difficult.]
(;W[bd];B[km]C[After the exchange, White incurs a big loss, the game is basically already over.];W[fc];B[hh];W[gh];B[gd];W[fd]C[W98 and W100: White is painful.];B[gi];W[hi];B[gg];W[ih];B[hg]
;W[ig];B[gc];W[gb];B[if];W[jf];B[he];W[ie];B[hf];W[ji];B[hb];W[fb];B[je]C[After the cut of B117, Black is still leading in the game.];W[kf]C[After the extension of W118, Black sinks into deep thinking. Zhou Heyang is already in overtime.]
;B[qg]C[The two-space extension of B119 is steady. Black's situation is favorable, but rarely players will defend this way.];W[id];B[ic];W[jd];B[fe]C[The hane of B123 is the urgent point, aiming at the thinness in the upper-left corner.];W[ee];B[ff]C[Black makes life with B125, fitting Lee Changho's solid style.];W[kq]C[W126: White makes some aji and aims to take advantage.];B[lq];W[lp]C[White crosscuts with B128 and wants to find loop hole.];B[jp]
;W[fr];B[hs];W[mq];B[lr];W[lo]C[With the hit of W134, White seems to have taken advantage already.];B[mr];W[ko];B[mo]C[B137: Black doesn't give an inch and wants to kill strongly.];W[mp];B[np]C[Please see variation.]
(;W[br];B[ar]C[B141 is right order.]
(;W[no];B[mn];W[nr];B[or];W[ns]C[W146: The aji is very bad.];B[os];W[oq];B[ms];W[nr]C[W150: It seems there comes a loop hole.];B[ns]C[Really?];W[op];B[nr]
;W[kr];B[ks]C[B155: White didn't find any loop hole, instead it all becomes losing moves.];W[gs];B[fs];W[es];B[dr]LB[gs:a][is:b]C[If White takes at 'a', Black will answer at 'b'.];W[pr]C[W160 is mistake, Black steps over crisis.];B[jr]C[If White played in the right order, Black is indeed very dangerous.];W[gs]
;B[hr];W[nn];B[qj];W[jc]C[W166: White turns the body around.];B[jb];W[kb];B[hd];W[pj];B[qi];W[pg];B[qf]C[B173 is steady.];W[jm]
