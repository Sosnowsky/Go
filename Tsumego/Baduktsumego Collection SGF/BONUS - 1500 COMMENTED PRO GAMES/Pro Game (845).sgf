;W[hc];B[nc];W[po];B[pl];W[mp];B[oo];W[on];B[no];W[qq]LB[pp:a][pr:b]C[W14: The old joseki is for White to bump at 'a', now the benefit of playing the attachment of W14 is next White can elect to play hane at 'b'.];B[nq];W[pp]
;B[oq];W[nn];B[mo];W[rp]C[W20 is simple and clear, this is also an old joseki.];B[hq];W[pi];B[qg]C[B23 is correct, if Black runs out B9, after White makes extension at 23, Black's large-knight's corner becomes thin, it makes a big difference, Black is not good.];W[ok];B[cn];W[fq];B[bp]C[Because White can invade at the bottom, Black attacks in order to defend with B25 and B27, taking chance to reinforce.];W[cq]
;B[ho];W[cf]LB[bq:a]C[W30: White takes tenuki, it is positive, the original move is to block at 'a'.];B[bq];W[en];B[dl];W[qh];B[pg];W[ol]LB[ri:a]C[The difference of W34 and W36 with Black's knight's move at 'a is huge, White takes tenuki again, testing Black's attacking skill.];B[dr]LB[gr:a]C[The strike of B37 is over zealous, Black should attack slowly by playing at 'a', this way the game would be still early.]
;W[hr]C[The attachment of W38 is a good move! Black suddenly doesn't have any answer.];B[gr]LB[ir:a][gq:b]C[B39: If Black plays hane at 'a', after White bumps at 'b', Black still can't take care of both sides.];W[gq];B[fr];W[hp]C[W42: White charges out, leading to an exchange, however it is not proportional, because Black's obtained territory is limited, however White's lonely stones turn into thick influence, its value can't be estimated.];B[iq];W[ip];B[jp];W[io];B[jo]

;B[pc];W[pd]C[W60 and W62 are excellent tactic to probe Black!];B[rd]LB[pe:a]C[B63: Black is reluctant to leave White the living tactic by playing at 'a', but due to this, White also obtains many outside uses for other purposes, overall, W60 and W62 are good moves, Black can't avoid to be taken advantage, Black is painful.];W[oc];B[pb];W[dj];B[db];W[fd];B[ec];W[gd]C[W68 and W70 are simple and clear, at first glance Black lives the corner in sente, but at the same time Black also incurs loss at the top, it is not damaging to White.];B[cc]
;W[bd];B[cd];W[ce];B[cj];W[dm]C[As to the attachment of B75, W76 is the winning move! This is very intense counterattack!];B[di]LB[cm:a][dk:b]C[B77: If Black blocks at 'a', then W 'b', White will enclose a big territory in the center, Black is not good.];W[cm];B[cl];W[bm];B[cr]
;W[ej]LB[ci:a][ck:b]C[W78: White pushes down in sente and then again comes back to continue attack with W82, Black's eye space is not enough, Black is already in a losing situation. With the earlier move of W76, if White plays hane at 'a' to enclose small side territory, B 'b', White couldn't seal off Black, the game would be still long.];B[ch];W[ei]C[The continuous press of W84 is tight!];B[eh];W[fh];B[eg];W[fg];B[ef];W[ff];B[ee]
;W[ed];B[bl]LB[de:a][bi:b]C[B93: If Black cuts at 'a', White can strike at 'b', Black is not good.];W[ko];B[kp];W[dh];B[dg];W[bi];B[ci];W[bh];B[cg];W[bg]
;B[bj];W[bc];B[gb];W[hb];B[bb];W[ab];B[ba];W[dc];B[cb];W[el];B[dk];W[ek]C[In the real game, White also can't kill Black strongly, White obtains overwhelming thickness on the outside with W112 and W114, leaving Black no chance to win the game.];B[je]
