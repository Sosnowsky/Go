(;B[rp]LB[nq:a][pk:b]C[B19: Generally Black will make the small knight's move at 'a', then W19, B 'b' and W 'c', the play in the game puts more emphasis on territory (see var a).];W[np]C[With the knight's move of W20, White should have nothing to complain.];B[nq];W[mq];B[oq];W[mp];B[pk];W[pj];B[nk];W[oj]
;B[ok];W[oh];B[pf];W[mi];B[lk];W[ki];B[jk];W[ii]C[W34 and W36 sticking the head out is impressive, here White definitely can't allow Black to cap.];B[gp]C[B37 is a good point.];W[gq];B[hp]LB[ip:a]C[However, B39 is slow, if Black jumps to 'a', White would be not that easy to connect together.

;W[iq];B[jo];W[jq];B[mc]C[B43: The decision where to play is hard to make, it seems that no matter where to play is not that good, but it looks like there should be a good move somewhere, I could't find one in a short time, if you are interested, try yourself to find a good move.];W[kc];B[le];W[oc]C[From the selection of B43, Kong Jie is also painstaking, but after the invasion of W46, Black still fails to enclose territory, the play in the game is not successful.];B[nd]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.];W[qc];B[pd];W[rc];B[ob]
;W[pb];B[nb];W[rd];B[re];W[rf];B[qf];W[se];B[qe];W[pc]LB[ra:a]C[W60: White can live completely by playing at 'a', but this way Black's cut at 60 would be sente, Black's outside is very thick and White can't be satisfied.];B[lh];W[mj];B[li]C[The push of B63 is a very bold move!]
;W[lj]LB[sd:a][sh:b][rk:c][pa:d]C[W64: Although White first gains 20 points by capturing with W64, but Black is left with some clever moves by using the aji of dead stones. Originally White can live the corner with the sente move at 'a', but Black's jump at 'b' is a brilliant move! Next White has to reinforce with the diagonal extension at 'c', then Black can kill White's corner by playing at 'd'.];B[kj];W[mk];B[ml];W[ll];B[kk];W[nl];B[mm];W[nm]
;B[mn];W[rm];B[he]C[The weird thing is that because Black invested too much earlier on, if Black directly kills the corner now, the situation is not necessarily to Black's advantage! Therefore Black first attacks White in the center with B75, seeking to take full advantage then playing to the clever move.];W[kh];B[lg];W[ik];B[km];W[il];B[jm];W[gk]LB[dn:a][fk:b]C[W82 is slow! For White to play at 'a' or 'b' is all better, this way White can ensure his superiority.]

;W[bc];B[hc]C[After Black takes chance to take full advantage, although B97 is very big, but killing White's upper right corner is much bigger. Black has missed a good chance!];W[nc]C[W98 should be reserved.];B[lb];W[sd];B[eb];W[ec];B[fb];W[gb];B[gc];W[db];B[cq]

;B[jg];W[gg];B[ih];W[ic];B[jb];W[ig];B[ri];W[rj];B[ih];W[ch]LB[od:a]C[W130 is an overplay! White should first find ko threats at around 'a'.];B[dh];W[ig]

;B[jd];W[ja]LB[mr:a]C[W172 is small, White should descend at 'a', this way White would be favorable again for the game.];B[oa];W[oe];B[of];W[pa];B[kq]C[B177 is a good tesuji! It is a huge move! The situation has been turned around again.];W[jr];B[kr];W[lr];B[kp]
;W[ks];B[ns];W[dm];B[cm];W[fk];B[mr];W[lq];B[be];W[bd];B[fm]LB[hn:a][ls:b]C[But B191 is the losing move! After White's knight's move at 'a', Black not only incurs loss in points and also makes White's ko at 'b' heavier, it is related to Black's big group's life-and-death, White can afford not to strengthen. With B191 Black could win the game easily with a slight margin by playing at 'a'.];W[hn]
