The two semi-finals were held on 7/5 in Tokyo, Japan. Japanese famous player Yoda Norimoto 9p made several mistakes under an absolute advantage, lost the game to Lee Sedol 7p by half point in the end and failed to advance to the final.];W[dp]C[White is Lee Sedol 7p of Korea.];B[cd];W[pp];B[qn]
;W[nq];B[cn];W[cl];B[ec];W[qo];B[pj]LB[pn:a][od:b]C[B11: For Black to extend at 'a' is normal, White will attack with a pincer at 11. Perhaps Yoda Norimoto doesn't want to get into a fight with Lee Sedol at this early stage of the game, so Black elects to play the steady moves: the extension of B11 and the corner enclosure of B 'b'.];W[pn];B[od];W[kc];B[cq];W[cp]
;B[dq];W[ep];B[bp];W[bo];B[bq];W[co];B[fq];W[cf]LB[ci:a]TR[kc]C[W24 seems somewhat unreasonable. The usual move is to make the two-space extension at 'a'. Now White already has one lonely stone at the top, however the extension of W24 is so wide, we can only explain this as Lee Sedol's style.];B[ic];W[ke];B[cj]
;W[ch];B[ej]C[The sequence of B25 through B29 is inevitable. Black certainly should initiate a two-pronged attack on White by exploiting White's weakness.];W[fg];B[ld]LB[ie:a][mc:b]C[However B31 is unnecessary. Normally Black should strike first then jump to 'a', but now since White didn't make one-space extension at 'b', Black should directly jump to 'a'.];W[kd];B[ie];W[gc]C[The counterattack of W34 is fierce and ruthless.];B[ee];W[ib];B[hb]
;W[hc];B[jb];W[id];B[ia];W[he]LB[hd:a][gb:b][gf:c]C[But the ensuing W42 is over-fierce. In fact, White should connect at 'a', then B 'b' and W 'c', White would connect and become thick, White should be very satisfied.];B[jd];W[hd];B[jc];W[je];B[if]
;W[jg];B[hf];W[gf];B[ih]C[Black gets out decisively with the sequence from B43 to B51, it is severe, White has been separated into two groups.];W[gi];B[gg]LB[jh:a][ig:b][ff:c][gh:d]C[B53 is a good move! If Black directly presses at 'a', White can push at 'b' to kill Black. In the game, after B53, if White answers at 'c', Black could press at 'a', White retreats, Black then connects at 'b'. Next if Black bumps at 'd', White would have no good answer.];W[hg];B[ig];W[gh]
;B[gb];W[kh];B[en];W[bn];B[cm];W[fp];B[gq];W[dl];B[el]LB[bm:a][em:b]C[The attachment of B65 is to fix Black's own shape. If Black turns at 'a' unyieldingly, after White's diagonal at 'b', Black couldn't move.];W[bm]LB[dm:a][dn:b][bl:c][bj:d]C[W66 is not good. White should turn at 'a', if Black connects at 'b', White can descend at 'c'. This way Black would become heavy, White is still left with the cross-over at 'd'.]
;B[ij];W[gk];B[eh];W[eg];B[ge];W[fe];B[fc];W[gd];B[fd];W[ge];B[hh]C[The sequence from B69 to B77 is very clever, Black has not only destroyed White's eye shape but also gained a lot of points.];W[gg];B[lg]C[B79: Black starts to attack White's big dragon, now Black has completely taken the initiative.]

Moreover, when B 'a', if White enters the corner at 'j', Black can connect at 'k', W 'l', B 'm', W 'n', B 'o', W 'p', B 'i', W 'q' and B 'c', it would be still a big victory for Black (see var b).]
