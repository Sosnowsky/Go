;W[df];B[od]C[The play of B7 is very popular recently.];W[qj];B[fq];W[hq];B[ch]LB[dk:a][cq:b]C[B9 and B11 are very thoughtful moves. Once if White pincers at 'a', Black will enter the corner at 'b'.];W[jc];B[lc];W[gd]LB[ec:a]C[Following W14, it seems White achieves nothing, with W14 White should make diagonal at 'a'.]
;B[gc];W[hd];B[db];W[cc];B[ee];W[ef];B[hc];W[id];B[cb]LB[fe:a]C[Through B23, Black obtains territory and also is left with the good extension at 'a', White can't be satisfied.];W[dk];B[cq]C[B25 is planned move.]
;W[dq];B[cp];W[do];B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[eq];B[cn]C[Through B33, Black succeeds in the opening.];W[nq];B[qn];W[pr];B[qq];W[no]
;B[ql]LB[mp:a]C[B39: Black can also first strike at 'a'.];W[qg];B[mp];W[mq]C[However, with W42 the value in lower side already becomes smaller, Black is also acceptable.];B[eh];W[di];B[dh];W[gj]LB[fe:a]C[W46: For White to play at 'a' is just the urgent point.];B[ff]C[White is being separated by B47 and sinks into a bitter battle.]

;B[kg];W[lf];B[lg];W[oe];B[pe]LB[mg:a]C[W64: White is forced to make damaging exchange with B65 in order to play hane at 'a'.];W[mg];B[kd];W[nf];B[gh];W[gi]LB[fi:a][je:b]C[W70: If White retreats at 'a', Black can separate at 'b' and capture several white stones.]
;B[mh];W[nh];B[kc];W[ie];B[ih];W[hf];B[ig];W[jd];B[mi];W[ni];B[nj]C[B81: Black fights by sacrificing, then takes chance to fix shape.];W[pc];B[pd]
;W[mj];B[lj];W[mk];B[lk];W[nk];B[og];W[ng];B[me];W[mf];B[jk]C[Through B93, Black is favorable.];W[qc];B[rd]C[The exchange of W94 and B95 is meaningless and a little damaging.]
;W[de];B[ei];W[fi];B[dj];W[ek];B[bf]LB[bj:a][bk:b]C[The order of B101 is questionable. Black should first jump to 'a' and exchange with B 'b', then play B101, this way Black is already alive cleanly.];W[ij];B[jj];W[bj]C[After W104, Black is a little uncomfortable.];B[ej]
;W[cj];B[bd];W[bh]LB[bg:a]C[W108 is mistake, White should attach at 'a'. White can also capture same number of stones but makes a big difference in points.];B[bg];W[bi];B[bc];W[cg]C[Although White obtains some profit by capturing several stones, ...];B[kp]C[..., Black gets to jump with B113, the situation is still to Black's advantage.];W[qr];B[lq];W[mo]
;B[iq];W[rc];B[ob];W[ip];B[hr];W[hp];B[ir];W[gr];B[jp];W[rq];B[rp];W[sr];B[oj]

;B[cm];W[in];B[lr];W[ro];B[qp];W[oc];B[nb];W[sp];B[rn];W[mr];B[il]LB[jm:a]C[The diagonal of B153 is overplay. Now Black is clearly favorable in territory, to jump at 'a' is the steadiest play.];W[pm]
;B[qo];W[si];B[sk];W[kl]C[After W158, both black groups are somewhat dangerous, this is also White's last chance.];B[kn];W[ll];B[jm];W[jl]LB[jo:a]C[W162: But White lost this only chance. White should hang at 'a' and destroy eye shape, then squeeze at 162, Black is very dangerous.];B[ik];W[im];B[fk]
;W[fj];B[hj];W[jr];B[kr];W[jq];B[js];W[hs];B[kq];W[hi];B[ii];W[rf]LB[jo:a][ls:b]C[W176: Since Black can turn at 'a', White can't destroy eye at 'a'.]
;B[gq];W[fr];B[gm]LB[re:a]C[B179 is inexplicable. If Black bumps at 'a', Black wins the game for sure.];W[jo];B[ls];W[sb]C[W182: White lives in the corner, the situation again has been turned around.];B[ln]C[But in the following endgame, White again gives his victory away.];W[dm];B[gk]C[First, the exchange of W184 and B185 is very damaging. White should play atari at 185.];W[le]
;B[nd];W[kb];B[lb];W[ja]LB[ib:a][ne:b]C[Next the play of W190 is weird. White certainly should hang at 'a', Black still has to reinforce at 'b' to make life.];B[pb];W[qb];B[ib]C[This game is very dramatic.];W[jb];B[re];W[ra]
