Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[pd]C[The final of Ahan Tongshan Cup was held between fast Gu Li and slow Qiu Jun, it is very interesting.];W[dd];B[qp];W[dq];B[do]
;W[oq]C[The opening for both sides is dignified.];B[cq];W[pn]C[The big slant of W8 is feint, the real purpose is to take territory.];B[op];W[np];B[oo];W[pq];B[on];W[qq];B[pm];W[ck];B[fq]LB[dr:a][kq:b][cr:c]C[The strike of B17 appears superficially clever, for Black to hane at 'a' is substantial. In the real game, after White makes extension at 'b', later on W 'c' pulling out is severe.]
;W[kq];B[cf];W[ch];B[fd];W[df];B[dg];W[cg];B[dc];W[ce];B[cc]LB[cr:a]C[From B19 to B27, both sides can be satisfied, White's tempo is steady and White aims to pull out at 'a', this is the hidden trouble of B17.];W[qf];B[nc]
;W[rd];B[qg];W[pg];B[qh];W[rf];B[ph];W[qc];B[pf];W[og];B[pc]C[As to W28, the play of B35, B37 and B39 is very strange. With B35, the common move is to answer at 36, this way the game is still long.];W[hc]LB[fc:a]C[After W40, Black becomes difficult, since Black now already can't end in gote by simply descending at 'a'.]
;B[ef];W[bf];B[gc];W[hd];B[kd]C[B43 and B45 are unusual maneuver.];W[fe]C[White attaches and cuts with W46, the situation enters into middle-game fight, Gu Li's talent gets chance to be utilized.];B[ge];W[gd];B[fc];W[ee];B[he];W[ie]
;B[if];W[je];B[id]C[Black fights strongly from B51 to B55, it appears far-fetched.];W[hf];B[gf];W[hg];B[gg];W[gh];B[hb];W[ic]C[The sequence from W56 to W62 is inevitable.];B[ig]LB[jc:a][ib:b][jb:c][ia:d][gb:e]C[B63: Black can only first play atari and is painful, if Black first wraps up at 'a', next W 'b', B 'c' and W 'd',  then Black can't play B63 any more, since after W 'e', then White crawls, Black is not good.

Although Black captures White, but White uses ladder breaker to play twice on the right side, the whole game is not to Black's advantage.]
;W[hh];B[jc];W[pl];B[qm];W[oh];B[kf];W[pj];B[rj];W[me]C[W72 is an asking move, Black is relatively difficult.];B[qb]C[B73: Black simply takes tenuki.];W[ke]LB[rk:a]C[W74 is a hasty move, White should attach at 'a', Black is difficult to handle.]
;B[le];W[ld];B[lf];W[jd];B[ib];W[kc];B[id];W[jb];B[ic]LB[of:a]C[The game enters into a chaotic fight, but at this crucial moment, Black surprisingly connects with B83! Now Black certainly should take tenuki and attach at 'a' simply, this way the outcome is still hard to imagine.];W[nd];B[nf];W[mf]
;B[mg];W[ng];B[of];W[mh];B[lg];W[lh]C[After W92, Black's center unexpectedly can't escape!];B[jf];W[kd];B[oi];W[nh];B[mc];W[md];B[rb]
;W[ih]LB[pi:a][cr:b]C[After White strengthens the big ko with W100, there leaves two good points 'a' and 'b'.];B[pi]C[However, with B101 if Black reinforces the lower left corner, the game perhaps will be a little complicated.];W[cr];B[cp];W[ep]C[White pulls out with W102 and W104, White's thickness gets to be fully used, Black is already in a losing situation.];B[jq]LB[cl:a]C[Black's sequence following B105 is completely not a place to play! Black should attach at 'a', which is just the right direction.];W[er]C[After W106, Black completely sinks into a difficult situation, eventually loses terribly!];B[kr]
