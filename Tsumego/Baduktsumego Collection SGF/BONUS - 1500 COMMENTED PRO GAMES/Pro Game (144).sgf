;B[qk];W[lp];B[nq];W[fq]C[Through W8, the opening is same as the game 1, however Black and White are switched.];B[cf]LB[fc:a][df:b][jd:c]C[B9: Black starts to vary, in the game 1, Ryu Shikun approaches the corner at 'a', next W 'b' and B 'c'.];W[fc];B[cj];W[nc];B[pf]
;W[qc]C[W14: White immediately enters the corner, it is rare.];B[pc];W[pb];B[ob]LB[qd:a]C[B17: For Black to block at 'a' to obtain sente is also playable.];W[qb];B[oc];W[re];B[jd]C[B21: Black first grabs the mutual good point and takes the whole game into consideration.];W[qe]LB[rf:a]C[W22 is to guard against Black's attachment at 'a'.]
;B[nd]LB[pe:a]TR[nc]C[B23 is a thick move, if Black connects at 'a', then the marked white stone has a very big room for maneuver.];W[md]C[W24: White probes Black right away.];B[mc]C[After B25, White first leaves it alone and takes chance to decide how to act, it is the advanced fighting strategy.];W[ch]LB[cl:a]C[W26: For White to make extension at 'a' is also possible.];B[cm]TR[cf]C[B27: Black first strengthens himself, treating the marked black stone as invasion to White's territory.

;B[qi];W[rq];B[rr];W[qq];B[qr];W[qp]C[Through W64, White lives cleanly. As for the whole game, White is leading in territory. However Black obtains sente, and Black also has a big potential in the center, the outcome of the game is unclear.];B[me]C[B65 leaves White unable to borrow any strength, Black becomes very thick, how White to reduce is a difficult task.];W[mr]C[The play of W66 is very practical,  White obviously thinks Black can't enclose the center with one move.];B[ip]C[B67 is feeling of professional players.];W[jq]C[W68 is the steadiest answer.];B[km]C[B69 is a mutual good point.
