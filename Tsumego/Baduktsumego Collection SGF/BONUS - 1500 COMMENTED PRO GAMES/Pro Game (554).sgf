Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[In the first round of south-north confrontation, Chang Hao 9p of south team meets Piao Wenyao 5p of north team. Chang Hao lost this game and south team lost by total score of 3:4.];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[fc]
;W[df]C[The play of W6 is often used by Chang Hao. He used this move to defeat Lee Changho recently.];B[oc]LB[kc:a][ic:b]C[B7 is variation. If B 'a', Black worries White's invasion at 'b'.];W[po];B[qo];W[qn];B[qp];W[rd];B[qc]LB[re:a][qe:b]C[B13 is rarely seen, it is commonly regarded that White takes advantage with W12. Black more often will play at 'a' ro 'b'.]
;W[ec];B[pj]LB[pn:a][qm:b]C[B15 is good move. If B 'a', White will extend at 'b', Black is not good.];W[fd];B[pn]LB[qm:a]C[After B15, now White doesn't have the tactic at 'a'.];W[fq];B[on]LB[kp:a]C[B19 is thick move and Piao's style. However if it is omitted, locally White still doesn't have any severe tactic. So B19 appears a little slow, for Black to play at 'a' is better.];W[kc]LB[kd:a]C[W20 is overly territory-oriented and not like Chang Hao's play. Since it is a territory race, W20 at 'a' is much better.]
;B[ke]C[B21 is good point.];W[id];B[ck];W[ci];B[cc];W[bd];B[cd];W[be];B[if]C[Next Black's sequence from B23 to B29 is also not bad. there is lot of aji left in White's upper-left corner. Black scores.];W[co];B[md];W[qh]C[W30 allows Black to enclose one more move with B31, then White invades with W32, it is very relentless. However to directly invade with W32 is more light and nimble.]
;B[gc]LB[qi:a]C[B33: At any rate, Black should play on the right side, for instance, to make diagonal at 'a'.];W[eb];B[he]LB[rj:a]C[Of course, B33 and B35 are big. However to attack W32 on the right side is more urgent. After White builds base at 'a' locally, Black's moyo comes to nothing, it is really painful.];W[rj];B[qf];W[qg];B[fe];W[gd]C[B39 is inexplicable. White gets to push and cut with W40.];B[hd]
;W[hc];B[ic];W[hb];B[ee];W[gb];B[jd]C[B47: Black again retreats and clearly incurs loss.];W[de];B[rk]C[Fortunately the strong attachment of B49 is working. However, Black may start crying.];W[rf];B[re];W[qj]LB[qk:a]C[Since the top is heavy, White can't play hane at 'a' and has to tolerate.]
;B[qk];W[pi];B[rg];W[oj];B[pk];W[nh];B[jq];W[ok]C[W60 is good point! Black is difficult to move.];B[ib]C[B61 is worth 20+ points and can't be omitted.];W[nn]C[The feeling of W62 is excellent.];B[nm];W[mm]
;B[mn];W[no];B[ol];W[pl];B[ml];W[lm];B[qm]LB[kp:a]C[But through B71, Black is not necessarily favorable, for Black to play at 'a' is not bad.];W[kp];B[jp];W[kq];B[jo];W[ko]
;B[jm];W[kl];B[jl];W[nk]LB[nl:a][mk:b]C[W80 is overplay. Black definitely wouldn't answer at 'a' and allow White to press at 'b'.];B[mk]LB[og:a]C[Black counterattacks with B81, at top the advantage of B 'a' is huge, White incurs loss. With W80 for White to play at 81 is better.];W[nl];B[om];W[mj];B[lk]
;W[kk];B[lj];W[kj];B[li];W[ni];B[og];W[oh];B[pg];W[ki];B[lh];W[rh];B[sf];W[ph]
;B[ij];W[kh];B[lg];W[nq]C[Through W102, the situation is not clear.];B[sj]C[B103 is relentless move. The left side is bigger, but here is double-sente endgame. White is reluctant to answer, but in the real game, the burden of carrying ko-living group is also very heavy.];W[si];B[sk];W[gm]C[W106 is of momentum and fits into Chang Hao's style.];B[gp];W[gq];B[hq];W[gj]C[W110: White is difficult to handle. If capturing small, White's territory is not enough; If capturing big, Black may not "agree".]
;B[kr];W[lr];B[ir];W[ks];B[fp];W[ep];B[ek]C[B117 is relentless, the game will be decided here.];W[fn];B[di];W[dj];B[ej];W[cj];B[gr]
;W[fr];B[dk];W[ho];B[hp];W[io]LB[gk:a][hk:b]C[W128 is losing move. After B 'a', Black connects together. White clearly fails in the attack. With W128 if White plays at 'b', the situation is still a little chaotic.];B[kn];W[ln];B[gk];W[in];B[jn];W[hk]
;B[hj];W[fk];B[gi];W[gl];B[ik];W[ng];B[dh];W[ch];B[cg];W[dg];B[bg];W[ei];B[eh]
;W[fi];B[fh];W[fj];B[hh];W[bk];B[bj];W[bi];B[bl];W[aj];B[al]C[B153 and B157: Black releases classic tesuji. White can't find ko threats and loses the game.];W[cl];B[cm];W[dl]
