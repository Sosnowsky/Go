;B[fq];W[hp]LB[dn:a][cn:b]C[As to the corner-approach of B5, White normally will answer at 'a' or 'b', the one-space high pincer of W6 is unexpected by Hu Yaoyu.];B[fo];W[dn];B[dr];W[cq];B[hr];W[go];B[fn];W[ck];B[ep]C[Through B15, it is a star joseki, Hu Yaoyu himself thinks that Black's speed is relatively slow, but his teammates think although Black's speed is not fast, the exchange of W12 and B13 is a big damaging move to White. After B13 becomes a iron head, B15 is one step slow but worthwhile.]

;B[no];W[oq];B[np]LB[po:a][pr:b][qp:c][qq:d][rr:e][nq:f][or:g][mp:h][jd:i]C[B31: If Black takes at 'a', then W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B26, W31, B24, W 'e', B 'f', W 'g' and B 'h', although this is also a typical corner  joseki, but comparing with the real game, the difference is whether to end in sente or gote. Because Black's tempo is already slow in the lower left corner, so when Black selects joseki in the lower right, he must select a sente one, in order to grab the big point at 'i' quickly.];W[pr];B[jd]
;W[qf];B[re];W[pi];B[oj];W[rf];B[ek];W[gk]LB[nq:a][mq:b][mr:c][lr:d][mp:e][nm:f][jk:g][or:h][kp:i]C[After Black obtains the vital point of B39, the play of W40 is a little inexplicable. White should crawl at 'a', then B 'b', W 'c' and W 'd', leaving the aji of the cut at 'e' and pulling out at 'f', then invade at 'g' to reduce Black's moyo, this is the proper play. After asking why Hu Yaoyu doesn't atari at 'a', forcing White to connect at 'h', this would eliminate the above aji, he said this exchange indeed can prevent White from pulling out at 'f', but later on White most likely will play at 'i' to make life from the root, so he wants to reserve the variations here.]
;B[cj];W[dj];B[dk];W[ci];B[cl];W[bj];B[bk]C[The moves from B41 to B47 are strong, White is hard to look after both the upper and lower sides.];W[cj];B[dm];W[cn];B[bm];W[cr];B[fj]
;W[gj];B[gi];W[fi];B[ei];W[fh];B[ej];W[hi];B[dg]LB[gh:a][fg:b][hh:c][ii:d][kp:e]C[B61: If Black directly runs out at 'a', White may extends at 'b', B 'c', White will enclose the left side at 61, when Black ataris at 'd', White will try to make life by playing at 'e' from the root. This way although Black still takes the initiative, but if Black can't kill White, the damage is huge, so Black elects a safe fighting strategy in the game.]
;W[cf];B[gh];W[hg];B[hh];W[ih];B[gg];W[gf];B[fg];W[ff];B[eg];W[ig]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.];B[jk]LB[he:a]C[B73 is a very proud move of Hu Yaoyu, with this move, Black has enclosed the center territory and also keeps an attack posture on White. Hu said, in the game, he originally prepares to attack White as a whole by playing at 'a', however after careful consideration, White only needs to grab the vital point at 73, then White would gain eye shapes and also reduce Black's moyo, and later on Black couldn't find any vital point to attack White. If Black plays at 'a' carelessly, the game may be over for Black!]

;B[nf];W[od];B[nq]C[B111 becomes a ko threat and also indirectly encloses territory, White is not optimistic.];W[nr];B[nd];W[me];B[mr];W[rr];B[pf]C[After White pierces through with B117, White's shape collapses.];W[og];B[pg];W[qe]
;B[pe];W[rd];B[cp];W[bp];B[do];W[br];B[ii];W[lr];B[lq];W[ms];B[kr]C[The retreat of B129 and B131 is the right play. If Black tries to kill White by playing the descent at 130, White certainly would make trouble inside Black's territory.];W[mq];B[lp]
