;B[fo];W[dn];B[ip];W[hp];B[ho];W[iq];B[jp];W[jq];B[kp];W[lq];B[lp]C[Liu Xing has some study on the press of B17, in this relatively short game, it is favorable to select your familiar openings.];W[mq];B[mp]
;W[nq];B[np];W[qk]LB[oq:a][op:b][pp:c][qq:d]C[The splitting move of W22 is steady, if White bumps at 'a', next B 'b', W 'c' and B 'd', Black can fight, White has no assurance of success.];B[qi];W[oq]LB[qn:a][qp:b]C[W24: For White to make two-space extension at 'a' is the original move, but after Black's diagonal at 'b', White is not good either.];B[op];W[qo]
;B[qm];W[ok];B[pn]LB[po:a]C[The diagonal of B29 is a slow move, Black should hang at 'a', this way in term of points, Black is much better than the real game.];W[oi];B[or];W[nr];B[qg];W[qq];B[kq];W[kr];B[lr]C[B35 and B37 are smooth and good moves.]

;B[cd];W[db];B[cl];W[eq];B[dh];W[nc];B[ne]C[B57 is a good point! If White gets to jump at 57, Black will be too passive for the whole game.];W[rh];B[qh];W[qc]C[White enters the corner with W60, showing Korean players' love to territory, and it forces Black to attack White strongly, otherwise Black's territory is not enough.];B[pc];W[qd]
;B[pe];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[pj];W[oj];B[pk];W[rf];B[rg];W[qf];B[pf];W[pl];B[qe]
;W[re];B[sf];W[rd];B[nh];W[mg];B[ng];W[ql]C[W74 and W82 are also completely territory-oriented moves. If Black fails to attack White in the center, Black's territory is definitely inadequate.];B[ol];W[pm];B[nl];W[qn];B[kg];W[ji]
;B[ig];W[hi];B[gf]LB[gd:a][gc:b][hk:c]C[B91 is a slow move, Black should probe White at 'a'. If White still atari at 'b', instead of making the knight's move of B91, Black can force at 'c', White wouldn't make life as easily as in the real game.];W[hl]C[Through W92, Black's situation is not good.];B[jl];W[dl];B[fl];W[dk]C[White again takes some territory with W94 and W96, White is really "relentless".];B[gd]
;W[gc];B[fj];W[kl];B[jm]LB[il:a]C[The retreat of B101 is too weak! Now if Black doubles at 'a', the situation will be more complicated.
];W[hn]LB[jk:a]C[W102: But White doesn't hane at 'a', it is really inexplicable! White basically already makes life this way!];B[ik];W[gj];B[gk];W[hk];B[ij]C[Black destroys White's shape in sente with B103 and B107.]
;W[hj];B[ii]LB[go:a]C[B109: But Black only captures half, it is not relentless enough, Black should connect at 'a', White's whole group is dangerous! Perhaps it is Liu Xing's misjudgment, in fact after White's atari at 'a', Black's territory is still not enough.];W[go];B[io];W[gn];B[om];W[po];B[on];W[rm];B[fi];W[cj];B[bi]
;W[le];B[hc];W[fb];B[hd];W[hb];B[ic];W[lc];B[md];W[ld];B[lf];W[bj]LB[cq:a][cm:b]C[The block of W130 is an overplay and the losing move! Since if Black enters the corner at 'a', White can't kill at all, White should hang at 'b', this way White's corner all becomes territory, White is favorable.]
;B[kb];W[ib]LB[lb:a]C[W132: White should simple block at 'a', it is better than the real game.];B[jc];W[nb];B[oc];W[oa];B[pa];W[qa];B[cq];W[dr];B[co];W[do]

;B[ro];W[rn];B[cb];W[ca];B[sg];W[sd]C[Black's victory comes when Black makes life following B139. Black lives with 5 points and also destroy's White's side territory, at any rate White will lose the game.];B[kc]C[The second phase of Nong Shim Cup will take place on 11/23-11/28.])
