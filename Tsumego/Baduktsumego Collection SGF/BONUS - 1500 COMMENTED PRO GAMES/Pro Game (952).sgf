;W[oc];B[de];W[dg];B[gd];W[dd]C[Just at the start of the game, "new moves" are released. First, Black's big knight's move of B9 leads to White's bump of W10, here the variation is worth study, but in terms of result, after this war, White already shows a losing trend.];B[ee];W[ce]C[This year, Kobayashi Satoru 9p's record is 32 wins and 6 defeats and ranks #1 in winning rate. Cho U 9p is 28 wins and 16 defeats and ranks #3 in most wins.];B[cf];W[df];B[bf];W[cd]C[Looking back, originally with W8 White attaches and retreats with W12 and W16, however Black doesn't connect and descends at 15 instead, White cuts and it leads to a fight, but in the crucial moment, W10 almost becomes a wasteful move! Therefore White is not good.

;W[fg]C[Before this game, the overall record between them is Cho U 5 wins and 3 defeats.];B[cl]LB[be:a][ck:b]C[In other words, with W16 even if the aji is not good, White still should block at 'a' to tighten liberties, with W18 White should pincer at 'b'. In the real game, Black gets to make two-space extension with B19 and also pincers White's one stone, B19 is an excellent move, however in the corner since White doesn't block at 'a', B7 and B11 two stones become light, White fails.];W[id];B[hf];W[fe];B[ge]LB[he:a]C[But White's bad moves continue, next White attaches with W22 to capture two stones and again ends in gote, this is fatal! With W22, White should crosscut at 23, next B 'a' and W22, only if White takes sente and attacks Black first, White may have a chance to win.];W[ed];B[kd]C[In the real game, Black instead gets to attack White with B25, White's strategy is very wrong.]
;W[of];B[qg]C[After this move, it is time for lunch break.];W[jd]C[W28: White has no other choice in this unfavorable situation.];B[kc];W[if];B[kf];W[ig];B[ib];W[hc];B[hb];W[gc];B[mc]C[Following B29 Black handles lightly, and Black strengthens steadily following B37, then Black grabs the big point at the bottom, Black already firmly takes control of the situation.]

;B[ck];W[gp];B[ep];W[en];B[fo];W[el];B[ip];W[go]C[After W46 White turns to fight in another place, but Black plays very steadily, White is forced to continue using some unusual tactics. For example, the crude move of W58.];B[fn];W[hn];B[gm]C[The diagonal of B61 is a good move!];W[fm]
;B[gn];W[io];B[jp];W[fr];B[bp]C[Black forces to do crude exchanges with W62, up to B67, Black completely handles all weak groups, Black's situation already is very favorable.];W[dj]C[Next White has no mindset to continue the fight and concedes defeat very early on.];B[bh];W[jo];B[kp];W[il];B[gk];W[bn]
;B[al];W[di];B[er];W[cp];B[cq];W[mo]C[Cho U has used 3 hours and 51 minutes, Kobayashi Satoru 3 hours and 41 minutes.

After this move, the game was closed for the first day.];B[ko];W[pn];B[km];W[fq];B[eq];W[hl];B[gl]
