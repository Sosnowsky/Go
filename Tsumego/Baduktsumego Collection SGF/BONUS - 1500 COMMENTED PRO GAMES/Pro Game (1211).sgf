;W[dp];B[cn]C[Black's opening following B7 is a little unacceptable.];W[fp];B[cf];W[fd];B[cc];W[cd];B[dc];W[ed];B[fb];W[bd];B[bc];W[dg]
;B[ck];W[pp]C[W20: White takes the empty corner and has nothing to complain.];B[ch]LB[gd:a]C[Black's play following B21 is weak, now Black must hane out at 'a' and initiate a fight to redeem his loss of the lower-right corner.];W[cg];B[hq];W[co];B[dn];W[bh];B[nq];W[qn];B[ho]LB[cq:a][cp:b][bo:c][eq:d][ep:e][fr:f]C[B29: Black still should strike at 'a', if White answers at 'b', Black already take advantage, if White counterattack at 'c', then B 'd', W 'e' and B 'f', Black will obtain a big territory.]
;W[fr];B[pj];W[pr];B[gn]C[In the real game, B29 and B33 are too heavy, this way how can you beat Lee Changho?];W[nn];B[pg];W[pc];B[pd];W[qk];B[qj];W[ob];B[pb];W[rj]
;B[pk];W[ql];B[ri];W[nc];B[qc];W[kd]C[The sequence from W36 to W48 is the typical settling pattern of Lee's style. The board becomes smaller and smaller, Black is more difficult to catch up.];B[lp]LB[eq:a][ep:b][fq:c][gq:d][gr:e][gp:f][er:g][hp:h]C[B49: Black should strike inside at 'a' in order to have a chance to win, here White can't tolerate and can only connect at 'b', next B 'b', W 'd', B 'e', W 'f', B 'g' and W 'h', this way although Black becomes thin on the right side, but White's loss in territory is also not small, Black still can fight.]
;W[bn];B[bm];W[bo]C[W50 and W52: White gets to play hane-and-connect, Black is falling way behind in territory.];B[dh]C[Black's play after B53 is even harder to understand, all crude moves! Does Black want to give up like this?];W[eh];B[bi];W[bg];B[ei];W[fi];B[fh];W[eg];B[ej]
;W[fj];B[fk];W[gk];B[ek];W[hi]C[After White jumps with W66, White is thick and also White has more territory.];B[gc];W[gd];B[nd];W[md];B[mc];W[nb];B[ic]C[As to Black's provocation of B71 and B73, White resolutely sacrifices three stones.]
;W[ne];B[od];W[hb];B[ld];W[me];B[kc];W[le];B[lc];W[jd];B[jc];W[id]C[Through W84, Black incurs a big defeat.];B[ji];W[jh]

;W[qs];B[kg];W[np]C[Overall in this game, Lee Changho didn't play any extraordinary moves, and Jo HanSeung unexpectedly suffered such a miserable defeat, it was really because of skill difference on the board? Or some psychological factor?])
