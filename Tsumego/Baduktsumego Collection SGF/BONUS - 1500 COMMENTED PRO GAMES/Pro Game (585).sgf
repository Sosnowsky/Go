Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[pd]C[This is one semi-final game of the 18th Fujitsu Cup between Lee Sedol and Yoo Changhyeok. So far this year, Lee Sedol keeps a very high winning percentage in international competitions.];W[dd];B[qp];W[dq];B[co]
;W[ck];B[hq]LB[fp:a]C[The counter-pincer of B7 is relatively new and fresh, for Black to play the "big slant" at 'a' is popular nowadays.];W[cp];B[do];W[fq];B[go];W[nq];B[lp];W[no]LB[qq:a]C[W14: White takes the whole game into account, for White to attach at 'a' is joseki, Black will take chance and become thick, Black can be satisfied.];B[pq]
;W[jp]C[W16: White starts to pound at Black's thinness, Lee Sedol's play is really sharp.];B[ep];W[eq];B[jq]LB[io:a]C[The attachment of B19 perhaps is miscalculation. Black should reserve the peep at 17, to jump at 'a' is the right shape.];W[hp]C[The attachment of W20 is a good tesuji, Black is a little difficult.];B[ip]LB[gp:a][iq:b]C[B21: If Black pushes at 'a', White can wedge at 'b', Black will collapse. Black has no other alternative but to play the sequence following B21. White takes the initiative very early on.];W[io];B[iq]
;W[gp];B[ho];W[jo];B[lq];W[hm]LB[lo:a]C[W28 is Lee Sedol's style, it takes some risk. For White to attach at 'a' is common feeling, White already should be very satisfied.];B[ln]C[The jump of B29 is very big. White must obtain considerable profit by attacking on the right side, so it seems Lee Sedol is very confident about his attacking ability.];W[kr];B[lr];W[en]C[The strike of W32 is good timing.];B[fo];W[jm]
;B[bp];W[bq];B[dp];W[cq];B[dl];W[dk];B[el];W[cm];B[gl];W[gm];B[fm];W[cl];B[fn]LB[fk:a][dm:b]C[B47: Black can consider to play at 'b', although White can strike at 'a', but obtaining half eye is very important.]

;B[hi];W[ji];B[hg];W[fg];B[jg];W[li];B[mm]C[Through B67, the local exchange comes to an end, White is a little favorable in the game.];W[qk];B[qm];W[qf];B[nc];W[md];B[mc]
;W[he];B[jh];W[ol]C[W76 is an overplay.];B[nk]C[The counterattack of B77 is good timing.];W[lk];B[pl];W[pk];B[ok]C[Through B81, Black captures one stone, the situation becomes much closer.];W[kd];B[jj]LB[lg:a]C[With the sequence from B83 to W88, both sides' eye shape has been damaged, Black can consider to reserve this exchange, with B83 Black can jump to 'a', this way Black can make life at any time.]
;W[hk];B[gk];W[ki];B[ij];W[kl];B[gf];W[qc]C[W90: White enters the corner, hoping to tangle with Black on both sides, but it is risky play.];B[qd];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[qe];W[pc]

;W[if];B[fh];W[gh];B[hh];W[gg];B[hf];W[ph];B[ne]LB[le:a][kf:b][oi:c]C[B117: Black is over "honest", Black should consider to push at 'a', next W 'b' and next Black can counterattack by jumping to 'c', this way Black can fight adequately.];W[ni];B[mh]LB[le:a][kf:b][mg:c]C[B119 is the losing move. Black should push at 'a', next W 'b' and B 'c', this way the situation will be very complicated.]
;W[nl]C[W120 is the winning move. Obviously Yoo Changhyeok has miscalculated.];B[hd]LB[ml:a]C[B121: At at rate Black should cut at 'a', after exchanging with White's cut, then Black can take tenuki. If White doesn't cut, White is also a little dangerous.];W[kg];B[ke];W[ml]C[In the real game, White captures two stones in sente with W124, it equals to Black conceding defeat.];B[om];W[le];B[ld];W[je];B[kc];W[kf]
;B[jc];W[ee]C[After W132, Black already has no chance to win.];B[cc];W[cd];B[dc];W[ec];B[eb];W[fc];B[fb];W[gc];B[gb];W[hc];B[id]
