;W[cf];B[db];W[od];B[oc];W[nc];B[pc];W[nd];B[qf];W[hc]C[In the opening, both sides seems to be well prepared.];B[hd]C[As to the pincer of W14, B15 is a prepared move.];W[ic]C[The sequence following W16 is common.];B[id]
;W[jc];B[gc];W[pd];B[qc];W[cc];B[jd];W[kc]C[Through W24, the local variation comes to an end.];B[fq]LB[hq:a]C[As to the corner-approach of B25, White has the mind to pincer at 'a'.];W[cn];B[jp]C[After B27, White is relatively difficult to select where to approach the corner.];W[qo]
;B[qm]C[As to W28, the tight pincer of B29 is a planned move.];W[oo];B[np];W[pl]C[W30 and W32 are Gu Li's style.];B[pm]TR[qf]C[But due to the existence of B23, after Black pushes and cuts with B33, the fight is not to White's advantage.];W[om];B[ol];W[ql]C[Following W36, White wraps up, .....];B[rl];W[rm]
;B[rn];W[qn];B[sm];W[pn];B[rm];W[qj];B[pj];W[ok];B[nl];W[pk];B[nm]C[......, but being ataried by B49, White's shape is not good.];W[on];B[ro]
;W[qp];B[qq];W[rp];B[rk];W[mn]C[W56 jumping out is imperative.];B[ll];W[pi];B[rj];W[mp];B[mq];W[nq]LB[lp:a]C[W62 looks like tesuji, but to extend at 'a' simply is better.]
;B[nr];W[lq];B[oq];W[mo];B[lr];W[ko];B[kq]C[Through B69, White doesn't have next move.];W[in]LB[ri:a][oj:b][mj:c]C[W70: If White first blocks at 'a', Black can escape one stone at 'b', which is severe, however with W70 White wants to make knight at 'c'.];B[mi]C[B71 is the vital point.]
;W[nh];B[ni];W[oi]TR[pj]C[W72 and W74 are damaging moves, but to prevent B45 (the marked stone) from escaping, White has no other choices.];B[mh];W[qg]C[W76 is tesuji.];B[qi];W[oj]LB[pf:a]C[But next W78 is very bad! White certainly should simply play hane at 'a'.];B[pg];W[qh];B[ri]
;W[pf];B[of];W[pe];B[ng]C[In the game, with the sequence from B79 to B85, Black is alert, and White is very painful!];W[mk]C[Following W86, White is forced to counterattack.];B[km];W[mj];B[lj];W[ph];B[rf];W[lk]C[As to the pound of W92,];B[kk]
;W[kj];B[jj];W[li];B[jo];W[jk];B[lm]C[B95, B97 and B99 are severe! White's stones in the lower-right corner are being captured, Black is favorable.];W[gd]C[The cut of W100 is inevitable.];B[fe]C[B101 is the correct move.];W[ge];B[gf];W[he];B[fd]
;W[ie];B[ig]C[B107 is good move.];W[je];B[fg];W[gh];B[hf];W[ef];B[ff];W[kg];B[ik]LB[cb:a]C[But Black's sequence following B115 is unnecessary, if Black crawls at 'a', White can't overturn the game.];W[jl]

;W[ij];B[fj];W[ji]TR[fj]C[The play of W128 and W130 equals to conceding defeat! At any rate, White should separate Black at 129.];B[jf];W[kf];B[dr];W[fp];B[gp];W[gm];B[fl];W[fn];B[fo]
;W[go];B[ep];W[eo];B[fp];W[en];B[dg];W[ei];B[fi];W[cg];B[dk]C[In the game, from B133 to B149, Black gains on both sides and makes life easily, it is completely not like Gu Li's game.];W[dq];B[cr]C[Recently, the momentum of Korean young players is very strong!]
