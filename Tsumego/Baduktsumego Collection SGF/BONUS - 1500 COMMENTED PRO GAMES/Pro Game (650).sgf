;W[ep];B[dn];W[jd]LB[cf:a]C[W8: For White to make knight at 'a' is rather steady, in the game with the pincer there will be more variations.];B[cf]LB[cc:a][dc:b][oc:c]C[B9: If Black enters the corner at 'a', then W 'b', Black will end in gote, then White will approach low at 'c', White can be satisfied.];W[ef]LB[df:a][ee:b]C[W10: For White to press at 'a' or make diagonal at 'b' is common, in the opening, O Meien seeks new variation, which is worth admiring.];B[cc]
;W[dc];B[cd];W[de];B[cb]C[B15 is good move to obtain sente.];W[db];B[hd]LB[nc:a]C[B17 pulling out immediately is strong move, to defend the corner at 'a' is also playable.];W[if]C[W18 is tight.];B[gf];W[ge]C[White's sequence following W20 is the strongest counterattack.];B[fe]
;W[he];B[ff];W[fd];B[gd];W[ed];B[id];W[ie]LB[je:a][jc:b][kc:c][kb:d]C[If W28 at 'a', then B 'b', W 'c' and B 'd', White is not comfortable.];B[jc];W[kc]
;B[kd];W[je]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.];B[jb];W[kb];B[ld];W[hb]LB[mc:a]C[W36: If White jumps out at 'a', the variation will be complicated, the play in the game is simple.];B[lb];W[ic];B[lc]LB[gc:a][ib:b][ka:c][ea:d]C[Through B39, it forms an exchange, Black gains a lot in the upper-right corner, but White obtains sente, the situation is still no clear. Moreover, B 'a' is not working, since White can play atari at 'b', after B 'c', White can crossover with diagonal at 'd'.]
;W[qp]C[W40: White defends the corner, seeking balance in territory.];B[hp]LB[pj:a]C[B41 is better than making extension at 'a'.];W[en];B[em];W[fn];B[do];W[fq];B[gq];W[gp];B[hq];W[ho]
;B[io];W[hn];B[lq];W[in];B[jo];W[kp];B[kq]C[Through B57, both sides are roughly acceptable, at a glance, Black is favorable, but considering in the beginning, Black is 3-to-1, so this result is normal.];W[qi]C[W58 is White's deserved compensation.];B[qg];W[qc];B[pc];W[pd]
;B[rd]LB[qe:a][oc:b]C[B63 is the strongest answer, if B 'a' or 'b', White all can live the corner easily.];W[oc];B[pb];W[pe];B[qf]C[After this move, the game was closed for the first day.];W[og]C[The play of W66 and W68 seems heavy.];B[gc];W[ib];B[ka];W[gb]
;B[fb];W[fa];B[kf];W[ig]C[W76 is to guard against Black's seal-off here.];B[pi]C[B77 is severe, White is not easy to handle.];W[pj];B[oi];W[mg];B[qj]C[After the cut of B81, White's loss on the right side is not small.];W[qk];B[rj];W[nb]C[Following W84, White tries to redeem his loss by attacking Black.]
