Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[pd]C[In the game 2 of the Chang-ki Cup, Zhou Heyang 9p took Black and defeated Kong Jie 7p, winning the champion by 2:0.];W[dd];B[qp];W[dp];B[fq]
;W[hq];B[oq];W[cn];B[qj];W[kq];B[fc];W[cf];B[db]C[Through B13, it seems the game will be a prolonged war.];W[nc]LB[cc:a][ic:b][qc:c]C[W14: White starts to change. If White makes diagonal at 'a', next B 'b' and W 'c', I feel it is a simple and good choice.]
;B[ob]LB[pf:a]C[B15 is more positive than jumping to 'a'.];W[hd];B[fe];W[gc];B[fb]LB[gd:a][hc:b][cc:c][ec:d][nb:e]C[B19: For Black to squeeze at 'a' as in joseki just fits White's intention, next W 'b', B20, W19, B 'd' and W 'e', White's configuration at the top is very adequate.];W[cc];B[kd]C[After B21, it leads to a complicated fight.]

;B[ie];W[qc]LB[kb:a][he:b]C[W36: White treats W16 and W18, White's thinking is nimble, since the territory is open at 'a', it is not big. And just because of this, Black is also no hurry to push at 'b', initiating a ko in the real game is a relatively positive play.];B[dg];W[df];B[bg];W[bf];B[dq];W[cq];B[ep];W[dr];B[er]
;W[eq];B[ba];W[ab];B[dq];W[he]C[Since there are no proper ko threats, White connects back two stones with W50, it is also playable.];B[ig];W[hg];B[ji];W[hj];B[cr]C[But after Black initiates the ko with B55, White's following sequence is very questionable, it directly makes White falling behind in the game.];W[eq];B[bd]
;W[be]LB[dq:a][bc:b][qd:c][ee:d]C[First, with W58 White can consider to eliminate the ko by connecting at 'a', next B 'b' and W 'c', White wouldn't incur any damage in the exchange; Second, with W58 White also should connect at 'b', this way W 'd' also becomes one ko threat.];B[dq];W[eg];B[eh];W[eq];B[ee];W[ad];B[dq];W[gh]
;B[fh];W[eq];B[de];W[bc];B[dq];W[cp]LB[cl:a]C[In the real game, White is one ko threat short, White can only make compromise with W72 and already incurs loss; Furthermore, if Black doesn't eliminate the ko, to force at 'a' is more positive, since this ko already becomes lighter.];B[cl];W[eq];B[qd];W[pc];B[dq];W[rp]
;B[qq];W[eq];B[jp];W[jq];B[dq];W[if];B[ds];W[kh]C[W84 and W86: White captures several black stones, but in fact it is not big.];B[mh]C[B87: Black first hangs.];W[mg];B[ng];W[lg]
;B[hb]C[Then Black jumps in with B91, here Black's play is very simple and clear.];W[od];B[qg];W[jc];B[ic];W[id];B[jb];W[kc];B[re]C[Through B99, Black is already clearly favorable for the game.];W[gb];B[ga];W[qk]
;B[rk];W[ql];B[rl];W[pj];B[qi];W[qm];B[mq];W[ip];B[kb];W[lc];B[rc];W[pi]C[The press of W114 is clearly a desperate play in an unfavorable situation, but in fact this speeds up White's defeat.];B[ph]
;W[oh];B[oi];W[oj];B[ni];W[og];B[ol]C[When Black strikes with B121, White already has no follow-up tactics.];W[pk];B[mk];W[nk];B[nl];W[nj];B[mj];W[ml]
;B[ll];W[mm];B[kk];W[lm];B[km];W[kn];B[on];W[jm];B[qn];W[kl];B[mi]C[After several white stones are captured, White has to concede defeat. Zhou Heyang wins the champion.])
