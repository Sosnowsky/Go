;W[nq];B[jd];W[qn];B[oo]C[With the diagonal's extension of B9, Black doesn't want to get tangled up too much.];W[qq];B[fc];W[cf];B[pm];W[pq];B[do];W[dl];B[fp]C[As to the pincer of W16, the small knight's move of B17 already becomes "a flying knife".]

;B[cn];W[bo]LB[hr:a][bq:b]C[W32: If White attaches at 'a', B 'b' would be a good move, the fight is not to Black's advantage and the variation is quite complicated.];B[iq];W[bn];B[gm];W[ip];B[jq];W[hm];B[hl]LB[el:a]C[The hane of B39 is the tempo of playing, if Black simply presses at 'a', then White will extend at 39.]
;W[gl];B[el];W[gk];B[dk];W[im]LB[cl:a]C[White makes two extension moves of W42 and W44 and must feel very good, otherwise with W44 White will consider to descend at 'a'.];B[cl];W[pn]C[W46: White originally wants to take advantage in sente, after seeing how Black to strengthen then consider how to invade the upper right corner.];B[on];W[ro];B[nc]LB[oc:a][om:b][qc:c]C[B49: Black elects tenuki and it is a inevitable counter-attack, however, Black should consider to make the diagonal's extension at 'a', if White still cuts at 'b', it would make a big difference from the real game. In retrospect, W46 and W48 are White's wishful thinking, here White should directly enter the corner at 'c'.]
;W[om];B[nm];W[ol];B[nl];W[ok];B[nj];W[qd];B[qe]C[The outer-hane of B57 is questionable, leaving White the chance of making life in the corner.];W[pc];B[od];W[nk];B[mk];W[oj]
;B[oi];W[pl]TR[qe]LB[qc:a]C[After White pushes with W60, White comes back to reinforce with W64, White has succeeded in the fight, the marked black stone should be played as the hane move at 'a'.];B[ni];W[ml]LB[lk:a]C[After the cut of W66, Black's outside is already very difficult to handle, although for Black to extend at 'a' is a gote move, but Black has no other choice.];B[ql];W[qm];B[pk];W[pm];B[qc]C[In the game, Black tenukis to reinforce the corner, it is unexpected.]
;W[lk]LB[pi:a][mj:b]C[W72: White should first cut at 'a', Black still has to play as in the game, then White can cut and atari at 'b' tenaciously, because Black is thin in the center, the fight would be favorable to White.];B[mj];W[pi];B[qi];W[ph];B[rj];W[ll];B[rl]LB[ki:a]C[B79 is a huge move! However it seems Black's knight's move at 'a' would be more important.];W[mh]
;B[og]LB[li:a][ki:b]C[In the game, Black lacks thorough considerations as to the game-deciding move of W80, Black gives way with B81 and is reluctant to get into a fight and take a risk by playing the diagonal's extension at 'a'. Therefore B79 is obviously no better than the knight's move at 'b'.];W[lj];B[li];W[lh]LB[id:a][hc:b]C[W84 is a big crude move! White certainly should answer with either the attachment at 'a 'or the invasion at 'b', this way there will have a lot of aji left in the center, for White the whole game is vivid.];B[ki];W[mi];B[ng]C[After Black doubles up with B87, Black already has gained a big profit, and Black still wants to escape his two stones tenaciously! Next it leads to a complicated fight. However White has incurred some damage first and can't see clear benefit.];W[kh]

Black should first pound White at around 'a' and then looks for opportunity to play the pincer at 'b' in sente (because if White doesn't reinforce, the simple hane of B 'c' is a good move), next Black can grab the point at 'd'.]

Because in the corner besides the jump of B 'a', Black can also live by playing the tiger's move at 'b'. White does't want Black to connect at 'c' (it is a gote move in fact), if so, now White should cut at 'd' to probe Black, no matter how Black to answer, White will all get the chance to strengthen the corner.]
