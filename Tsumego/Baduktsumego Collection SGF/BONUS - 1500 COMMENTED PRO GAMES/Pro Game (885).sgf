Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[pd]C[I will introduce the final game 2 of the 30th Meijin Title between Kobayashi Satoru 9p and Cho U 9p. Before this match, Cho U is leading 1:0.];W[dd];B[pq];W[dq];B[do]
;W[po];B[pm];W[qk]C[The counter-pincer of W8 is Cho U's favorite, for White this local variation is perhaps worth study.];B[qm];W[no];B[qo];W[qf];B[ph];W[qh];B[qi];W[pi]C[W14 and W16: White attaches and cuts to sacrifice, they are good moves. Although Black is thick but hard to find any effective way. Looking back, White has already prepared for this tactic by the exchange of W10 and B11.];B[oh]C[Although the set pattern following B17 is about even, Black is a little dissatisfied.

;W[ri];B[qg];W[rh];B[pp]LB[fp:a]C[B21 is a thick play of Japanese style, but it seems slow. Black wants to make the knight's move at 'a'.];W[co];B[cn];W[cp];B[fc];W[cf];B[dm];W[fq];B[ci]
;W[db];B[pf];W[rg];B[jc];W[pg];B[of];W[ke];B[ld];W[qc]C[W38: White enters the corner and again obtains profit.];B[pc];W[qd];B[gf];W[kh]
;B[eb];W[cc];B[jf]C[Black must make some profit by attacking. Black starts to attack following B45.];W[kf];B[jg];W[mf];B[oi]LB[kg:a][lg:b][lh:c]C[B49 itself is not big, Black can consider to push at 'a', next W 'b' and B 'c'.

;B[mh]C[Following B65, Black changes the attacking direction.];W[lh];B[mj];W[kj];B[ll];W[jk];B[kp]C[Through B71, Black also gains some profit.];W[jn];B[il];W[km];B[ik]C[B73 and B75 are questionable moves, Black mistakenly judges White's thickness/thinness, in fact White already has adequate eye space. With B73 Black should play at 74 or 76, enclosing a big territory, this way Black's situation is not bad.
];W[lo]C[W76: White takes chance to enter into Black's territory, Black's territory instantly appears inadequate.]
;B[mq]LB[kk:a]C[B77: At any rate Black should diagonal-cut at 'a' to fight desperately.];W[gn];B[hp];W[nl]C[W80 is a good move to force Black make the exchange from B81 to W84 by counterattack. So far, White's big dragon is very safe.];B[jl];W[kl];B[lk];W[kk];B[pj];W[bh]C[White gets to grab the big endgame of W86 in sente, Black's territory is already clearly inadequate.
];B[ep]C[Following B87 Black separates White to fight desperately for victory.]
;W[fp];B[fo];W[gr]C[But White's calculation is accurate, after White takes profit with W90...];B[go];W[bi];B[cj];W[hn]C[..., then White connects back one stone with W94, not giving up anything.];B[ko]C[Following B95, Black starts to attack angrily.];W[lm];B[mm];W[ln];B[nm]
;W[gl];B[hj];W[jo];B[jp];W[mp];B[nq];W[iq];B[ip];W[gd]C[But through W108, White's big dragon is alive completely, Black is losing.];B[fk];W[gc];B[gb];W[ol]
