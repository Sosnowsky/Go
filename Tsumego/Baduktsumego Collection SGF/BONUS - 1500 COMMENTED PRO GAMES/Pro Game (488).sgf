;W[qo];B[eq]C[Black elects to defend his two corners with the sequence from B1 to B7, this opening is returning to very old times.];W[cj];B[cl];W[fc]LB[df:a][ej:b]C[As to the three-space extension of B9, with W10 White usually will jump to 'a' or 'b', the play in the game is to seek high efficiency, hoping to jump to 'b' next to form a good shape, of course Black doesn't want to follow White's good plan.];B[be];W[cd];B[ch];W[ej];B[eh]
;W[el];B[gh]C[The sequence from B11 to B17 is normal.];W[fp]LB[co:a][do:b][cn:c][dm:d]C[W18: If White attaches at 'a', Black will hane at 'b', Black becomes thick and White is no good; If White invades at 'c' instead, then Black will fight by making the diagonal extension at 'd'. Because White has considered all the above, White elects to play the conservative move in the game with W18.];B[ep];W[fo]LB[fn:a][eo:b]C[The shoulder hit of W18 perhaps can be considered, the questionable move is the extension of W20. With this move, for White to jump at 'a' instead is the right move, this way next White can aim to invade, if Black extends at 'b', at any rate White wouldn't connect at 20. In the game, White has incurred a big loss in territory and White can only hope to cultivate his center.];B[eo]
;W[fn];B[gr]C[But with the sequence from B19 to B23, White is over care-free.];W[pi];B[qg];W[hq];B[gq];W[io];B[hc]C[Black continues to take cash (territory) with B25 and B29.];W[oh];B[pn]LB[nn:a]C[When White extends with W30, Black invades with B31, White has only one way to go: attack strongly. With B31, for Black to play at 'a' instead would be better.];W[nn]C[The cap of W32 is inevitable, Black is somewhat looking for trouble.

After this move, it is time for noon break.]
;B[po];W[qn];B[pp];W[qp];B[oq];W[pm]LB[pr:a]C[W38: If White descends at 'a' instead, Black will extend out at 38, White can't kill Black.];B[pr];W[qq];B[mq]C[However, Black handles lightly from B33 to B41, it is not a bad strategy. Since White is not good in the opening, now the situation is to Black's advantage.];W[oe];B[he]C[As to the cap of W42, Black takes tenuki to strengthen himself completely, making White's three stones in the corner weaker, this is also a key move for Black to keep advantage for the game.]
;W[qe];B[re];W[rd];B[qf];W[pe];B[rc];W[pc];B[qc];W[nc];B[ob]C[White didn't gain much profit with the sequence from W44 to B53, but there is also no other good tactic.];W[op];B[np];W[oo]
;B[qi]LB[or:a]C[The attachment of B57 is a good move! This prevents White's tactic of playing the cut at 'a' to make a ko.];W[qj];B[qh];W[ii]C[In an inferior situation, White has no choice but to bluff with W60.];B[nf];W[of];B[ng];W[og]C[After this game, the game was closed for the first day.];B[bd];W[bc];B[bb]
;W[cb];B[ac];W[cc];B[cf];W[hb];B[ib];W[gb];B[nr]LB[rj:a]C[Black's play from B61 to B75 is steady, but Black can elect to play the hane at 'a' more positively.];W[jf];B[ke];W[rj];B[lg]
;W[id];B[ic];W[jd];B[gc];W[fd];B[if];W[kd];B[ge];W[kf];B[jg];W[kg];B[kh];W[le]
;B[jh]C[From the push of W80 to B93, White's loss outweighs his gains, White's situation has been deteriorated.

After this move, it is time for noon break.];W[cm];B[bm];W[bn];B[bk];W[dm];B[bj];W[co];B[bp];W[gi];B[fi];W[gj];B[il]
;W[hl]LB[kj:a]C[W106: White definitely should counterattack at 'a', in the game Black makes a ponnuki, White's defeat  has been already decided. In the game Black makes the game simpler through exchanges.];B[fj];W[fk];B[hk];W[ik];B[ij];W[jk];B[gl];W[gk];B[hm];W[hj];B[jl]
