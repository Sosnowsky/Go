Translation:GoGameWorld.];B[qd]C[In the league game 6 of the 34th Korean Myungin title between Cho Hunhyun and Yoon HyunSeok, although there are only 140 moves, but it fully shows the  "fast gun" style of Cho Hunhyun.];W[dd];B[pp];W[oc]C[The direct approaching move of W4 is Cho Hunhyun's favorite play, its purpose is clear, aiming for a chaotic fight.];B[dp]
;W[qn];B[pe]C[The diagonal's extension of B7 is a steady move, but White can double approach and should be very happy.];W[nq];B[np];W[mp];B[no];W[oq];B[pq];W[mo];B[mn];W[ln]LB[op:a][nn:b][pn:c][kq:d]C[W16: If White instead pushes at 'a', then Black will turn to take territory, if White cuts at 'b', after B 'c', it would lead to a fight, moreover for White to strengthen at 'd' is also playable, the move in the game is a novel play. Overall, White aims to make the extension on the right side after some false attack.]
;B[qo];W[pm];B[op];W[qi];B[jp]TR[nq][oq]C[The pincer of B21 is the right move, capturing two white stones would be too small!];W[lq]LB[kq:a][lr:b][ko:c]C[After the exchange of W22 and B 'a', later on White still needs to guard against Black's hane at 'b', White would be hard to deal with. Perhaps the simple tiger at 'c' is better. We can see the remained problem later in the game.];B[kq];W[ko]
;B[jo];W[cq];B[dq];W[cp]C[W28: It looks like that White wants to leave Black the side territory.];B[cn]LB[do:a]C[B29: Black elects to obtain sente, probably for Black to simply extend at 'a' is better. However, this is not the main problem.];W[bn];B[cm];W[dr];B[er];W[cr];B[do]
;W[fr];B[es];W[bm];B[kp]LB[lr:a]C[B39: Black starts to attack White, White should stand at 'a' to get one eye at the bottom with sente, running out is not a problem, but ...];W[jn];B[in];W[jm];B[im];W[il]LB[eq:a]C[With the play of W40, W42 and W44, regardless of his own defects, White instead aims at the cut of W 'a', maybe it can be regarded as Cho's style.];B[lr]
;W[mq];B[jl]LB[nn:a][mm:b]TR[mn]C[B47: Black decides to separate White and initiate a fight, whether it is a good or bad move, we shall not comment, the problem is: when White separates the marked black stone at 'a', this is the key point for Black's connection, Black unexpectedly didn't extend at 'b' and just ignored it? Even a novice knows a ponnuki in the center is worth 30 points!];W[nn];B[ik]LB[mm:a][lm:b];W[hl];B[hk];W[gl];B[fq]
;W[mm];B[jk];W[fk];B[fi]C[Because Black appears so weak and powerless, when Black initiates the attack with B57, White dares to use any counter-attack maneuver.];W[gn];B[ho];W[fp];B[gq];W[gj]C[After W62, Black surprisingly comes under attack.];B[hh];W[ii];B[hi]
;W[dl];B[cl];W[hj];B[ij];W[ji];B[ki];W[kj];B[jj];W[ig];B[kh];W[jg];B[lj];W[fh]C[Through W78, Black unexpectedly couldn't pull out his two stones.]

;W[gc];B[fd];W[hb]TR[ec]C[Through the whole game, it's just White's one-side show, after White ataris with W92 and W94, Black has to take the marked stone which is worth only 1 point! It is too sad that Black has inflicted such a crushing defeat!];B[eb];W[ga];B[dc];W[cc];B[ed];W[db];B[ec];W[cb];B[be]
