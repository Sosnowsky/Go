Copyright by gogameworld.com and weiqi.tom.com.]RE[B+R];B[qd]C[Zhou Heyang guessed Black, because Nong Shim Cup uses Korean Go rules, the komi is 6.5 points , and since it is a fast game, the format is relatively favorable to Black.];W[cp];B[dc];W[pp];B[eq]C[B5: Black elects to play low approach, which is the style of fight and strength.]
;W[gp];B[eo];W[dn];B[ip];W[de]TR[dc]LB[cf:a][ce:b]C[As to the pincer attack of B9, because of the position of the marked black stone, White has the state of mind to take tenuki, so White didn't tangle with Black in the lower left corner, the common play is to make the large knight's approach at 'a' or low approach at 'b'.];B[dl]C[B11 is a very momentum play, since White didn't elect to play here, Black plays here.];W[en];B[fo];W[dq]
;B[er]LB[dr:a][cr:b][fn:c]C[B15: If I were Black, I will elect to play hane at 'a', when W 'b', then Black turns at 'c'.];W[fm]LB[di:a]C[After the diagonal of W16, Black seems to lack one move at the bottom, but Black already can't continue to play here any more, otherwise if White gets to pincer at around 'a', Black can't tolerate, but at any rate Black always feels uncomfortable at the bottom.];B[cg];W[ef];B[gc];W[dh];B[ch];W[di]
;B[ci];W[dj];B[cj]LB[bk:a]C[B25 is a strong move, if Black crosses over with the knight's move at 'a', then White will easily obtain sente and strike first at the bottom, Black appears no good.];W[ck]C[The hane of W26 is inevitable, here starts a surprisingly fierce fight.];B[dk]LB[cl:a][bk:b][bl:c][bm:d]C[B27: If Black pincers at 'a', then W27 and B 'b', this result is not bad; If White descends at 'b', then B27, W 'c' and B 'd', White is no good. In the game, the cut of B27 is a little relentless.];W[cl];B[dg]
;W[eg];B[ek]C[B31 looks like "a clever move with an inefficient shape".]
(;W[fj]LB[cm:a][eh:b][ei:c][fh:d][fi:e][gh:f][gi:g][hi:h][hh:i][hg:j][ih:k][gg:l][hj:m][bd:n][ig:o]C[W32: If White retreats at 'a', next B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f', W 'g', B 'h', W 'i', B 'j', W 'k', B 'l', W 'm', B 'n' and W 'o', this way the situation is still hard to judge (see var a), in the game with the jump of W32, an exchange on the left side already can't be avoided.]
;B[cm];W[bm];B[bn];W[dm];B[cn];W[bj];B[am]LB[aj:a][fk:b][bk:c][bl:d][al:e]C[B39: For Black to pincer at 'a' is a local tesuji, followed by W 'b', B 'c', W 'd' and B 'e', it will lead to a ko, but unfortunately Black doesn't have ko threats, so this tactic is not working.];W[bk]
;B[do];W[fk];B[fn];W[em];B[co];W[cd];B[cc]TR[am][bk]C[Through B47, Black obtains the lower left corner by sacrificing the left side, it forms an exchange, locally I feel both sides are acceptable, Black is not bad at all, in the meantime it is better to reserve the exchange of the marked black and white stone.];W[oc]TR[dg][cg][ch][ci][cj]C[The corner-approach of W48 is positive, although Black can live the five marked stones, but now it is more important for White to open a new fighting field, otherwise White can't utilize his thickness.]
;B[pe];W[qj];B[nq];W[pn];B[pc];W[od]LB[oq:a][np:b][kp:c]C[W54: If White wants to take initiative, White can also make the diagonal hit at 'a', next B 'b' and W 'c', this also will lead to a fight.];B[lc];W[me];B[jd];W[qg]C[Through W58, although White is falling behind in territory, but White's left side is very thick, it seems the fight will last very long.]
;B[oe];W[mc];B[ld];W[ne];B[pg];W[qf];B[qe];W[pr];B[lp];W[ph];B[og];W[oh];B[nh]LB[mg:a][mf:b][le:c][jf:d][lb:e][kb:f][pb:g][qb:h][nb:i]C[I feel the play of B71 is of favorable consciousness, the common play is to jump at 'a', next W71, B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f', W 'g', B 'h' and W 'i', leading to a ko, Black has no certainty of success, in the process when W 'e', Black can consider to play at 'i', the variation is a little complicated, it seems Black can fight.

In the game, perhaps Zhou Heyang feels it is also not bad for Black to grab the hane of B71.]
;W[ng];B[mg];W[nf];B[ni];W[pb];B[qb];W[nb];B[pa];W[lb];B[kb];W[kf];B[ol];W[ql]C[Through W84, White gains a lot of territory, now I feel Black's situation is not very optimistic.]
;B[la]LB[jb:a]C[B85: Black threatens White's eye shape and also guards against White's tactic of clamping at 'a'.];W[lh]C[W86 is a good move, taking advantage before reinforcing the cut.];B[mh];W[le];B[li];W[hd];B[hc];W[oa]C[The timing of initiating a ko with W92 is not bad.];B[ob];W[ki];B[na]C[B95: Black has no choice but to eliminate the ko.]
;W[kj]C[Through W96, although Black obtains some territory at the top, but White takes control of the center, so the situation is still not clear.];B[pk];W[qk];B[kl];W[lk];B[lg];W[kg];B[qh];W[rh];B[ll];W[mp]LB[ml:a]C[W106 prepares for the hane at 'a' with W108.]

;B[jr];W[mr]C[Through W134, although White captures three stones, but the center is damaging, so far Black is favorable for  the game.];B[qi];W[ri];B[pi]C[Since White starts the ko with W92, White didn't gain anticipated result by attacking in the center, however Black gets to live the left side in sente, now White is way behind in territory.];W[im]C[The sequence following W138 is not to White's advantage.];B[nn];W[lm];B[om];W[mm];B[mo];W[km]
;B[op];W[nr];B[in]C[Through B147, if there is no surprise, I think Black will win.];W[hn];B[ho];W[ie];B[kh];W[jh];B[hm];W[il];B[bc];W[ec];B[eb]
;W[id];B[gd];W[ge];B[je];W[jf];B[ic]C[Through B163, Black achieves a big victory.];W[kr];B[if];W[he];B[fe];W[gf];B[ir];W[gn]
