After two days of intense fight, Meijin Yoda Norimoto took Black and defeated Kisei Yamashita Keigo by 7.5 points, pacing one solid step to his four consecutive titles.];W[dc];B[dq];W[co];B[pp]
;W[oc];B[cf];W[de]LB[jd:a][kd:b]C[As to the large knight's approach of B7, the play of W8 is unexpected, W8 is usually played when White has stones at around 'a' or 'b', White can expand his moyo on the upper side. But now White has no any stone at the top, White instead elects a joseki which is damaging to territory, it is no appropriate.];B[bd];W[dh];B[df];W[ef];B[eg];W[dg];B[ee];W[ff]
;B[dd];W[ed];B[ce];W[fe];B[ec];W[de]LB[fd:a][db:b][pe:c][ep:d][gd:e]C[W22 is again questionable. Now White has two approaches of W4 and W6 on both sides, White should connect at 'a', forcing Black to atari at 'b', next White can knight-press at 'c' or 'd', making a moyo on the upper or left side by using the thickness in the upper left. Overall, it is a must for White to expand his moyo by taking sente. In the game, White takes with W22, after being wrapped up by Black, White still need to take one stone at 'e', Black gets to stick his head out at 'c', White is no good.];B[db];W[cd]

;W[cp];B[eo]LB[eq:a][dn:b]C[B39 is a move that puts more emphasis on the whole game. According to joseki, Black should connect at 'a', White cuts at 39, Black extends at 'b'.  However in the current situation, White's thick wall is waiting there in the upper left, it would be certainly unreasonable for Black to fight this way.];W[eq];B[fq];W[er];B[gp]C[So Black gives up the corner territory with B39 and B43, it is a clever play.];W[dr]LB[dm:a][fo:b][fr:c][gr:d][cn:e][dn:f][cm:g][cl:h][bl:i][dl:j]C[W44 is a wrong sequence play. White should first make the knight's move at 'a', Black takes at 'b', then White can capture one stone at 44. Perhaps Yamashita Keigo didn't think Black would jump to 'a', or he maybe fear that when White makes the knight's move at 'a', Black can block at 44, however White can atari at 'c', then B 'b', W 'd', B 'e', W 'f', B 'g', W 'h', B 'i' and W 'j'. Because the upper left corner is White's thickness, Black can't start a direct confrontation with White like this.

After this move, it is time for lunch break.]
;B[dm]LB[fo:a][eh:b]TR[pe]C[B45 is a good move. In most of times, to take at 'a' to eliminate the hidden trouble is the first choice for professionals. However, in this situation, Black has no only ruined White's side territory and also given support for escaping at 'b'. The marked black stone is a small diagonal's extension, White doesn't have any effective tactic of playing the ladder breaker.];W[qn];B[eh];W[di];B[gg];W[cl];B[gi]C[The sequence from B47 to B51 is severe, White has incurred a big territory loss in the upper left to exchange for a tremendous thickness, but now Black still can challenge on White's thick wall, this can show White's earlier selection of joseki in the corner is very dubious.];W[jd];B[bn]
;W[ek];B[dl];W[dk];B[bq]LB[br:a][cn:b][bl:c][cq:d][fr:e]C[B57 is an excellent timing. If White answers at 'b', then the block of B 'b' would become sente, Black can omit a move at 'c'; If White answers at 'd', then the block of B 'e' would become sente, White is very painful.];W[cq];B[bl];W[gk];B[fr]
;W[br]LB[bp:a][ap:b][ao:c][aq:d][bo:e][cr:f]C[W62: If White tenukis, Black can extend at 62, followed by W 'a', B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e' and B 'f', White would die unconditionally.];B[fl];W[fm];B[gl];W[gj];B[gm];W[hi]
;B[nq];W[qj];B[nd]LB[hh:a]C[B71 is a very clever move. If Black hangs at 'a', although Black can manage to make life, but Black would come under severe attack.

After this move, the game was closed for the first day.];W[ig];B[ii];W[hj];B[qh];W[rp];B[qq];W[pl];B[kp]TR[nd]C[In the game, Black first presses White at the top with the marked stone, next gets rid of the burden in the center, then makes the side extension with B75 and B79, Black takes a commanding lead.]
;W[qb];B[kd];W[nc];B[je];W[id];B[md];W[kc]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.];B[jl];W[km];B[jm];W[rc];B[qc];W[rb]
;B[pm];W[qm];B[pk]LB[om:a][pn:b][qo:c][ro:d][ol:e]C[B93 and B95 are sharp! If White counterattacks at 'a' with W94, then Black can draw back at 'b', followed by W94, B 'c', W 'd' and B 'e', White would have no answer.];W[ql]C[W96: White is painful.];B[ke]C[After Black connects with B97, Black is leading in territory and thick on the whole board, White will suffer a big defeat for sure.];W[mp];B[mq]
