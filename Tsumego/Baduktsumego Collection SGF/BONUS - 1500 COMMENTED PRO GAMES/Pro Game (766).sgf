Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[In the semi final of the 10th NEC Cup held in Fuzhou, I defeated Kong Jie 7p and advanced to the final for the second consecutive year. In the last year's final, I played one careless move in the middle game and failed to win the champion, this year I will not make the same mistake. In the other semi final game, Gu Li 7p defeated Zhou Heyang 9p.];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[fc]
;W[hd];B[cc];W[dc];B[cd];W[de];B[db];W[eb];B[cb];W[ec];B[cf];W[oc];B[pe];W[nd]C[I once used the opening up to W18 in a game between Wang Lei 8p and me.]
;B[pc]LB[fb:a]C[B19: Black can also clamp at 'a'.];W[of];B[pg];W[pb];B[qb];W[pf];B[qf];W[oe];B[ob];W[ce];B[be];W[pd]C[After the diagonal extension, through the throw-in of W30, both sides have no way to back down. If proceeding normally, White can't win this ko.]
;B[od];W[bf]C[But in this situation, White just has the big ko threat of cutting with W32, the result after the exchange is very exciting, both sides can be acceptable.];B[nc];W[bd];B[fb]LB[hb:a][qn:b]C[The clamp of B35 is impulsive. Black doesn't expect White will counterattack by jumping to 'a', in the game Black incurs loss, with B35, Black should directly protect the corner at 'b'.];W[hb];B[qn];W[dk];B[jp];W[fq]
;B[ge];W[he];B[gf];W[hf];B[gg];W[fd];B[hg];W[on]C[W48 is a common reduction maneuver.];B[op];W[lo];B[lq];W[jo]TR[ge][gf][gg][hg]C[With W50 and W52, White is eyeing for Black's four stones at the top from far away.]
;B[ip];W[qp]C[W54 is an asking move.];B[nn]LB[qq:a]C[B55: Black usually will block at 'a', perhaps Black feels his situation is not optimistic, so he elects to attach out, leading to a fierce fight. So far, the reserving time for both sides has run out, each of the following moves has to be done within 30 seconds, it is a challenge for both sides.];W[nm];B[mn];W[po];B[qq];W[ol];B[mm];W[ml];B[ll]
;W[mk];B[lk]LB[km:a]C[B65: For Black to hang at 'a' is the original move, but Black is worried that after White turns at 65 in sente, Black's four stones at the top can't connect together with the bottom.];W[no]LB[mj:a][km:b]C[White's counterattack following W66 is inevitable. If White extends at 'a', then Black will hang at 'b', clearly Black takes advantage.];B[mo];W[mp];B[lm];W[lp];B[kp];W[ko]
;B[io];W[jm];B[jn];W[kn];B[in];W[km];B[oo];W[pn];B[np];W[mq];B[il]C[Through B83, both sides refuse to make compromise, go fans who is watching the game alive feel very enjoyable. Most people think this kind of play doesn't look like both of our styles.];W[kq];B[kr]
;W[lr];B[jr];W[im];B[hm];W[hl];B[jl];W[hn];B[gm];W[gn];B[fn]LB[fm:a][hq:b]C[The hane of B95 is the losing move! Black should extend at 'a',  this way White can jump at 'b', it would be still a ko fight, but Black's situation will be much better than that of the real game.];W[hk]
;B[ik]LB[go:a][kl:b]C[B97: Black also can only capture two stones by playing at 'a', after White pushes out at 'b', although Black is also not good, but Black can still hold on for a while.];W[fm];B[gl];W[fo]C[In the game, White captures one stone in sente with W98 and W100, the bottom and corner turn into White's territory.];B[gk];W[ir];B[jq];W[hq];B[nr];W[ls]
;B[lq];W[hp];B[mr];W[kq];B[bg];W[ae];B[lq];W[qh];B[kl];W[qg]C[Next with W114 and W116, Black incurs a heavy loss! In the following process, White basically keeps the favorable situation on the board.];B[ql];W[kq];B[ms]
