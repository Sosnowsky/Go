;B[cj]LB[bd:a][cg:b][ch:c]C[After the corner-approach of B5, the three-space extension of B7 is a trend, if Black makes the knight's move at 'a' instead, Black is worried about White's attachment at 'b', but the defect of the invasion at 'c' clearly exists with the three-space extension in the game.];W[od];B[oc];W[nc];B[pc];W[nd];B[qf];W[jc];B[co];W[ep]
;B[dn]C[The sequence from W8 to B17 is quite dignified for both sides.];W[ch]C[W18: White aims to open up the situation.];B[cc]TR[fd]C[Because the marked white stone is in a high position, Black enters the corner lightly with B19, it is the correct choice.];W[cd];B[bd];W[dc];B[bb];W[cb];B[bc];W[eh];B[ej]LB[cg:a]C[B27 is a questionable move very earlier on. Black should bump at 'a', it is just right timing.]
;W[db]C[After White connects with W28, Black is very painful.];B[df];W[fg];B[bh]LB[bg:a]C[B31: Black finally has managed to attach over, Black is left with a more severe hidden trouble of the hane at 'a', Black's opening is already half-step slow.];W[nq];B[qn];W[pr];B[mq];W[mp];B[lq];W[qq]
;B[np];W[nr];B[mo];W[fj];B[lp]LB[no:a][og:b][hp:c][mp:d]C[The lower right corner is joseki, but it is unnecessary to spend two moves (B41 and B43), Black should extend at 'a', this way when White plays at 'b', Black can get to play at 'c', for White to pull out one stone at 'd' is still too early.];W[og];B[rp];W[qp];B[qo]
;W[rq];B[mg]LB[bg:a]C[B49 is a game-deciding move. Black must dive into White's territory in order to have a chance to win. However, White is favorable in ko threats, White's hane at 'a' is very severe!];W[pe];B[qe];W[kg];B[mi];W[ki];B[me];W[oi];B[ke]LB[lj:a]C[B57 is unreasonable, to make the diagonal's extension at 'a' is the original move.]
;W[ld];B[le];W[mj]LB[nh:a][bg:b]C[In the game, after White seals off Black strongly with W60, Black can only seek life by a crude peep at 'a', White's hane at 'b' on the left side will immediately become reality.];B[jd]C[The diagonal's extension of B61 is an asking move.];W[nf]C[W62: White resolutely cuts Black's way back, as a result, it leads to a very complicated fight.];B[kc];W[lc];B[ic];W[jb];B[jg]LB[ge:a][id:b][hc:c][bg:d]TR[bh]C[B67: The crucial fight over here will decide the outcome of the game, however surprisingly Black has missed a good opportunity! Black certainly should play at 'a'! This is an absolute move for both defense and offense! It not only guards against the cut at 'b' (if cutting, Black can extend at 'c', White's cutting stone can't escape) and also forces White to strengthen himself, this way White can't easily hane down at 'd'. Even if Black plays at 'a' instead, the outcome would be hard to imagine, but it is still not sure whether Black can get away from this bitter battle, but after missing this good point, Black is clearly losing the game, the basic reason is the marked black stone, which results in Black's passivity on the whole board.]
;W[bg];B[cg];W[id]LB[bi:a]C[In the game, because White has the severe tactic of playing the atari at 'a' following the hane of W68, White dares cut with W70, enclosing territory and also taking the chance to snatch away Black's base, Black already has no way to look after both the center and left side.];B[ie];W[hd];B[kd];W[kb];B[ge];W[gd];B[dh];W[jh];B[ig]
