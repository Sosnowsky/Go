(;SZ[19]EV[10th Samsung Cup final game 2]DT[2006-01-12]KM[6.5]PC[Seoul, Korea]PB[Lee Changho]BR[9p]PW[Luo Xihe]WR[9p]C[Commentary: Wang Lei (s) 5p,
Copyright by gogameworld.com and weiqi.tom.com.]RE[B+3.5];B[pd];W[dd];B[qp];W[dq];B[oq]C[Today Lee Changho starts with the steady worry-free corner by B1, B3 and B5, apparently he prepares for a prolonged war.]
;W[co]LB[qj:a]C[W8: Normally White will split the right side at around 'a', in the real game Luo Xihe perhaps wants to take Lee Changho into an unfamiliar situation.];B[fc];W[cf];B[db];W[hc];B[cc];W[fd];B[ec];W[gd];B[iq]LB[pj:a]C[B15: For Black to play at 'a' is also a good point, since White already takes influence at the top, so Black should first contain White's moyo on the left side. If Black runs a territory race with White, White's outside influence at the top will be put into play, so Black elects to make extension with B15, it is reasonable.]
;W[qf];B[nc];W[rd];B[qg];W[pg];B[qh];W[rf];B[qc];W[ph];B[qi]C[Through B25, now two josekis are played in the upper-left corner and upper-right corner, Black continues to take territory.];W[lc]LB[pi:a][pe:b]C[W26: White's hope is, when Black turns at 'a', White doesn't need to hang at 'b'.]
;B[pi];W[of]TR[pd][nc][qc]C[W28 is rarely seen, but it is a good move in this situation, now White is not alive locally, so Black definitely will pull the marked three stones out and try to threaten White.];B[ld];W[kd];B[md];W[ke];B[mf];W[nh];B[ni]C[B35: Black hopes to enclose territory on the right side.];W[lg]C[W36 is a good move not allowing Black to borrow strength. However, it seems White incurs territory loss in the top joseki and White's thickness doesn't bring into play, so White's situation appears a little constrained.]
;B[pe];W[pf];B[oh];W[ng];B[li]C[B41 makes White very painful.];W[rc];B[rb];W[pb];B[qb];W[nb];B[mb];W[mc];B[ob]
;W[oc];B[na];W[nd];B[nb];W[me]C[In the real game, White has to strengthen the cut in sente! But White's loss is big! Looking back, after W16, White incurs a lot of territory loss and also Black becomes thicker on the right side, White fails in the fight.];B[od];W[oo]C[W56: White has to open another battle field.];B[pn];W[on];B[om];W[nq]C[W60 is a good feeling to mess up the situation.];B[nm]C[B61 is a steady move.]
;W[pq];B[pp];W[or];B[op];W[qq];B[rq];W[jp];B[jq];W[ip]C[W68 and W70 are unusual tactic, however they seem very crude, even if Black just answers normally, White wouldn't be any good, now White tries all he can to complicate the game.];B[hp];W[ho];B[gp];W[go]
;B[kp];W[kq];B[kr];W[lq];B[fo];W[in]C[White's series of provocation has been calmly negated by Black! It is not to White's advantage and the board becomes smaller.];B[fp];W[gr];B[fr]LB[lr:a][mr:b]C[The opinion from Korean study room: with B83 Black should first play at 'a', after W 'b', then B83, White will be more difficult this way.];W[lr]
;B[fm];W[ir];B[hq];W[jr]TR[jp][ip][ho][go][in]C[W88: White grabs territory desperately, but White's five stones in the center are very heavy, in this kind of situations, Lee Changho is very skillful.];B[cm];W[ck];B[ko]C[Black wants to enter into White's influence by attacking White's five stones.];W[np]C[W92 treating five stones lightly is the correct play.]
;B[jn];W[dn];B[dk];W[mn];B[rr];W[io]C[W98: White connects out five stones, it looks heavy, Luo Xihe's only purpose is make the situation complicated.];B[il];W[hl]LB[hm:a][im:b][jm:c][gm:d][gl:e]C[If Black plays hane at 'a', next W 'b', B 'c', W 'd' and B 'e', it will lead to a ko.]
;B[gl]C[B101: Here is the pivotal battle, after thinking for a long time, Lee Changho elects to play steadily and avoid fight, now the situation is still to Black's advantage.];W[jm];B[km];W[jl];B[hm];W[im];B[hk]C[Now Black is leading about 15 points on the board.

After this move, it is time for lunch break.];W[jj]TR[ck]C[W108 is the only move, next Black's normal move is to hane and capture the marked white stone.];B[cq]C[B109 is an asking move.];W[dp]C[W110: White has to retreat, this exchange is not to Black's advantage.]
;B[dr];W[cr];B[er]C[B113 is the right move, this way Black can take the center.];W[bq];B[ll];W[fn];B[en];W[dm];B[cj];W[gn];B[em];W[eo];B[hr]

(;W[dl]LB[gs:a][is:b][ks:c][eq:d][hs:e][gq:f][js:g][fs:h][ep:i][ds:j]C[Now W 'a' will lead to a ko, next B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f', W 'g', B 'h', W 'b', B 'i' and W 'j', but for this ko White is also very heavy, so basically White dares not initiate the ko (see var a).
];B[ek];W[bj];B[bk]
;W[cl];B[ci];W[lk];B[ne]C[The play of B131 is somewhat hard to understand.];W[mk];B[nk];W[el];B[fk];W[gj]C[W134 and W136 are Luo 9p's top-rated strong moves, Lee Changho's play is questionable. Now Luo's situation takes a better turn, the game becomes chaotic.];B[kk]LB[jk:a]C[B137 is a good move at this time, White should connect at 'a'.];W[kj]LB[jk:a]C[The block of W138 should not work, if Black pushes at 'a', White will very difficult to handle.]
;B[ei]C[B139 is really inexplicable.];W[kl];B[ml];W[fl];B[bl]C[B141 and B143: Lee Changho calls off his troops calmly. Although White gains a big profit, but it is not enough to turn the game around.];W[gk];B[lj];W[le];B[gi];W[fj];B[bi]C[Although White captures several stones in the center, but Black grabs two big endgames on the left side, locally White gains, but overall for the whole game, Black also successfully simplifies the situation.];W[si]
;B[sj];W[pr];B[ln]LB[jk:a]C[It seems Black's play in the center is relatively messy, but Black didn't make any big mistakes. With B139 Black may feel the play in the game is more straight and clear and Black is willing to take a little loss. In fact if Black pushes at 'a', White is already going to collapse, now Black is still leading about 10 points on the board.];W[po];B[qo];W[qn]C[W156 is a game-deciding move, White can only live unconditionally in order to have a chance to win, just initiating a ko is not enough.];B[no];W[pm];B[nn];W[rj];B[ri]
;W[sh];B[sg];W[sk];B[rg];W[ro];B[pn]LB[rp:a][rm:b][so:c][sn:d]C[B167: Black should play at 'a', next W 'b', B 'c', W 'd' and B167, this way the right side is ko.];W[rm];B[rp];W[rl]C[W170 is an excellent move, Black perhaps ignores this good move.]
;B[hj];W[gs];B[is];W[ks];B[eq];W[hs];B[gq];W[js];B[fs];W[is];B[ep];W[gm];B[ds]
;W[hl]C[W184: Although White lives one group on the right side, but White can't win the ko in the center, White is still not good.];B[qk];W[sn];B[gl];W[bd];B[cd];W[ce];B[ed];W[ee];B[hl];W[bc];B[bb];W[ab]
;B[ba];W[dh];B[lh];W[dj];B[ej];W[di];B[fi];W[nd]C[Through W204, Black still keeps 10+ points lead on the board, since the opponent is Lee Changho, White basically loses the game.];B[bn];W[gb];B[fb];W[pl];B[mp]
