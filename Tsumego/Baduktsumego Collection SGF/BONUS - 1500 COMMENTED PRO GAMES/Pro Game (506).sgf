;W[qj];B[de];W[dh];B[cn]C[B9: Black tenukis to approach the corner, it has the implication of probing White.];W[fd]C[W10 is a punishment to Black's tenuki, it appears that Lee Sedol is not afraid of Black's double approaches.];B[fq];W[fp];B[gp];W[fo];B[cq];W[eq];B[cp]
;W[gq]C[Through W18, it is a common joseki.];B[ck]LB[cl:a]C[B19: Black guards against White's extension and check at 'a', and also supports Black's one stone in the upper left.];W[nc];B[qf];W[ne]C[W22 is a bold conception.];B[pb]C[B23: Black prevents White from entering the corner at 3-3.];W[ef]C[W24 is the vital point, White has formed a moyo at the top.];B[cc];W[cb];B[ec]LB[db:a][bb:b]C[B27 is rarely seen, the usual move for Black is to cut at 'a' or hane at 'b'.]

(;W[cd]LB[eb:a][dd:b][db:c][fc:d][ed:e][gc:f]C[W28 is strong, if White hane at 'a', then B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e' and B 'f', it would lead to a complicated fight, from the whole board's configuration, Black can fight (see var a).];B[dd];W[bc];B[db];W[cc];B[hc];W[jc]C[W34 is the vital point for attack and defense.]
;B[ed];W[fe];B[eb];W[cf];B[ic];W[jd];B[he];W[ie]C[W42 is a good move, Black is not comfortable.];B[df];W[dg]
