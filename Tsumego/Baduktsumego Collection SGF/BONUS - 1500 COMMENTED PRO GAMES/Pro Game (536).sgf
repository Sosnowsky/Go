Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[pd]C[On 10/30, in Korean league tournament, Lee Changho 9p meets Yoo Changhyeok 9p, the game between them is already very rare nowadays.];W[dd];B[qp];W[dp];B[fq]
;W[cn];B[kq];W[qj];B[pk]C[As to the splitting move of W8, the sequence following B9 is new study trend recently.];W[qk];B[pl];W[ql];B[qm];W[qg];B[pm];W[pj]C[W14 and W16 are Lee's style.];B[nc]
;W[ko]C[Then with the cap of W18, White reduces territory slowly.];B[ip]LB[lo:a][qq:b]C[B19: If Black encloses territory by attaching at 'a', White can attach at 'b' to probe Black, Black will be difficult. So, in the game, Black adopts the tactic of attacking after White's invasion.];W[oq]C[Due to support of W18, White bravely plunges into Black's territory with W20. Korean league tournament is fast game, here it leads to a fierce fight, both sides have no certainty of success.];B[mq];W[qq];B[rq];W[rr];B[qr];W[pq];B[sr]
;W[rp];B[rs];W[qo];B[oo]C[B31 is the vital point for the shape.];W[np];B[mn];W[nn]C[W34 is tesuji!];B[nm]LB[no:a][mp:b]C[B35: If Black pushes at 'a', then White will take chance to press out at 'b', Black is not good.];W[no];B[on]
;W[mm];B[ln];W[nl]C[W40: White is very happy!];B[om];W[pp]C[Then after White takes one stone with W42, it seems Black is very dangerous.];B[nq];W[op];B[mk]C[B45 is tesuji to get out of crisis.];W[ml]LB[nk:a][km:b][mp:c]C[Since there is no time to think in fast games, White dares not attach at 'a' with W46. Moreover, for White to simply net at 'b' is tesuji, however Black can simply reduce liberties at 'c', White's liberty is short in capturing race.]
;B[ok];W[km];B[kn];W[jn];B[lo];W[lp];B[kp];W[jo];B[mp];W[rn];B[rm];W[po]LB[sp:a]C[After wrapping up, White makes eye with W58, it seems White is successful, however White is not alive completely, with B 'a', it will form ko-kill.]
;B[oj];W[oi]LB[ph:a]C[As to the turn of B59, the play of W60 allows Black to pierce through by B 'a', it is perhaps playing psychology, but it is always not good, with W60 for White to make small diagonal at 'a' is steady.];B[ph];W[pi];B[mj];W[ng];B[ik]C[The jump of B65 is a very good move, White instantly feels restricted to stick head out.];W[im];B[jl];W[jm];B[lg]
;W[pr];B[qe];W[qh];B[dm]C[Plus, White is hurry to strengthen with W72 in gote, when B73, Black already takes control of the game.];W[hp];B[hq];W[gp];B[gq];W[jp];B[jq];W[io];B[fp];W[mo]C[W82 is a forcing move under time pressure in overtime.]
;B[cm]C[B83: Black shouldn't take tenuki.];W[lm];B[cq];W[dq];B[dr];W[iq];B[ir];W[eo];B[fo];W[en];B[br];W[fn];B[ci]
;W[gc];B[cf];W[ek]LB[fl:a][gn:b][gm:c][hm:d]C[W98 is huge, if Black makes the knight's move at 'a', then Black has the strong tactic of B 'b', W 'c' and B 'd'.];B[cc];W[cd];B[dc];W[ed];B[eb];W[ck]
;B[ef];W[fb];B[ec];W[bc]C[W108 initiating the ko is game-deciding move.];B[bb];W[be];B[ac];W[ad];B[bd];W[jj];B[mh];W[bc];B[ab]
;W[fc];B[bd];W[bf];B[cg];W[fe];B[ae];W[gg];B[ce];W[md]C[Next through B125, White obtains sente and gets to attack with W126, White turns the game into even situation.];B[mc];W[ld];B[jh];W[nk]

;B[co];W[kr];B[dn];W[ls];B[gf];W[ff];B[hg];W[ge];B[hf]C[Next it is complicated endgame fight, but endgame is clearly Lee Changho's strong point, although there are many moves and it has eye-dazzling ko-exchange, in the end it is still Lee Changho who gets the upper hand.];W[he];B[ch];W[cj];B[me]
