Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[The match between father and daughter is very rare in Go scene. Although only one player can win, but as to them the win or defeat is already not important any more. In the opening stage of the game, Izumi takes the initiative to attack, her beautiful moves once made her father unable to withstand, in the end she lost the game since her strength seems still a little childish, otherwise it would be a huge upset.];W[pp];B[cd];W[dp];B[jc]C[The unique opening of B5 is a special play that Kobayashi Izumi's husband Cho U has studied, Izumi used this to play against his father ... so it seems that in her eye Cho U is a little stronger than her father Koichi.]
;W[oc];B[cn];W[dk]C[W8: White hopes Black to enter the corner at 3-3, this would enter a prolonged war which is Koichi's specialty.];B[en]C[Of course,  Izumi knows, Black jumps out with B9 to start a fight.];W[fp];B[di];W[fk];B[gn];W[hp];B[in];W[hk];B[jk]
;W[gh];B[eh]C[The cap of B17 and the diagonal of B19 all put the biggest pressure on White.];W[jl]LB[ii:a]C[W20 seems a little unreasonable, to make the knight's move at 'a' is steady.];B[il]C[The hane and cut of B21 is inevitable, here Black can't allow White to stick the head out.];W[ik];B[kl];W[jm];B[im];W[km];B[kk];W[jp]
;B[jo]C[The diagonal of B29 is a good move!];W[kp];B[lm]C[Black pushes out with the hane of B31, Black is successful.];W[kn];B[ko];W[ln];B[lo];W[mn];B[lp];W[on];B[ji]LB[gj:a]C[B39: The feeling of the jump is first-rated! Strengthening herself and also aiming at White's weakness at 'a'.]
;W[dm]LB[fm:a]C[The peep of W40 is careless! White should first peep at 'a', waiting for Black to connect then playing W40, then there will be no other variations.];B[el];W[ek];B[eo]C[Koichi clearly underestimates Izumi's strengthen, Black obtains sente with B41 and B43, Black is alert!];W[cq];B[gk]C[Then, Black wedges with B45, White unexpectedly can't look after both sides! After this move, it was just time for lunch break, don't know whether Koichi praised Izumi in the lunch: it seems Izumi improved a lot since she got married with Cho U!];W[gj];B[gl]C[It is time for lunch break.];W[fi];B[hj]
;W[hi];B[ij]C[Black captures White's key stones and connects herself all together with B51, Black is thick on the board, so far Black is overwhelmingly favorable for the game. However, many years' trained skill makes Koichi not panic even in a losing situation, now White is leading in territory, Black needs to exert power in order to win the game, regrettably in this area Izumi is inexperienced.];W[ff];B[de]LB[df:a]C[The shape of B53 is not right, Black should make the knight's move at 'a'.];W[dc];B[ed];W[lc];B[hg];W[gg];B[hf];W[fd]
;B[ec];W[df]TR[de]C[In the game B57 and B59 look fierce and ferocious, but White's crude moves following W62 are very practical, White has just used the weakness of the marked black stone (B53).];B[cf];W[dg];B[cg];W[ee];B[db];W[dh];B[ci];W[bj];B[bi];W[dn]
;B[do];W[co];B[bo];W[cp];B[dl];W[cm];B[cl];W[bl];B[bk];W[bm];B[ck];W[ei]C[Through W84, White makes life and scores a lot of points, Black's attack fails.];B[pc]LB[qn:a]C[Black's biggest losing move is B85, the direction is completely wrong! In fact, White is not afraid of making a two-space extension, with B85 Black should pound at White in the lower right by playing at 'a', because Black in the center is extremely thick, Black definitely will gain some profit in the fight, after taking all the advantage, then Black plays B85. Go is like a war, strategic mistake can't be redeemed.]
;W[od];B[pf];W[qj]C[White just has defended his weakness by W88, Black's territory is already inadequate.];B[ob];W[nb]C[After W90, White's task is to make life for all his groups, however this is just what Koichi is good at.];B[pb];W[ke];B[ne];W[id];B[pk];W[pj];B[ok]
;W[oj];B[om];W[pm];B[qm];W[qn];B[pl];W[pn];B[rk];W[qh];B[rg];W[qf];B[rf];W[ng]C[W108 and W110 are all very beautiful moves. In the end, Black is in a hurry to make life, Black didn't gain anything.]
