;B[ci];W[nc];B[lc];W[qf];B[nd];W[qc]C[W12 directly entering the corner is popular nowadays.];B[qd]LB[pc:a]C[B13: For Black to block at 'a' is also playable.];W[pc];B[od];W[nb];B[rd]
;W[rc];B[pg]C[The variation up to B19 is common.];W[pj];B[pl]LB[pm:a][qo:b]C[B21 is a strong move, Black can also pincer-attack at 'a' or approach at 'b'.];W[qn]LB[md:a][mc:b][me:c][jd:d][mg:e][qg:f][hc:g]C[W22 is a good point, for White to play hane and cut at 'a' is also a good point, next B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f' and W 'g', White is favorable.]
;B[om]LB[ql:a]C[B23 is to prevent White from crossing over at 'a'.];W[mj]C[W24 is a good move.];B[qg]LB[po:a][qo:b][pq:c][qp:d][pn:e]C[B25 appears slow, now Black should make the knight at 'a', next if W 'b', then B 'c' is a good move; If White answers at 'd', Black clearly gains advantage, if White pushes at 'e', Black can wedge at 'd'.];W[np]C[Through W26, White can be satisfied.];B[ml];W[kj]
;B[kl];W[ij];B[do]LB[lq:a]C[B31: In terms of the result, for Black to make extension at 'a' is better.];W[jq];B[nj]LB[ok:a]C[B33: Black starts to attack first, Black is reluctant to allow White to strengthen at 'a'.];W[ni];B[oi];W[nk];B[oj];W[mk]
;B[ok];W[nl];B[nm]LB[rl:a]C[Through B41, Black gains some profit in territory, but White obtains sente and later on White still can fly to 'a', so the outcome of the game is still unclear.];W[cm]C[The invasion of W42 is good timing.];B[co]C[Although B43 is thick, Black seems to have been taken advantage.];W[eq]C[W44: White probes Black.];B[er]LB[fr:a]C[After B45, White can take chance to play hane at 'a'.];W[cg]C[W46: White invades and tries to take initiative.]
;B[ee]C[Follow ng B47, Black faces the fight directly.];W[fe];B[ef];W[dh];B[fd]C[B51: Black takes a big risk.];W[cd]LB[gd:a][fc:b][gc:c][eb:d][gb:e]C[W52 is good order, if White plays atari at 'a' directly, then B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', if W52 now, Black can play hane at 'e', White is not good.];B[bd]
;W[gd];B[fc];W[gc]LB[be:a][de:b][bc:c][dd:d][ad:e][ec:f][db:g]C[W56 is a little overplay, now to cut at 'a' is a good move, next B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f' and W 'g', this variation is better than the real game.];B[ec];W[dd];B[db];W[cb]
;B[de];W[cc];B[gb];W[hb]C[White dares play W64, since White is favorable in the ladder.];B[ge];W[ff];B[fg];W[gf];B[he];W[hd]LB[fb:a][eb:b][ga:c][hg:d]C[W70 is a good move, if White directly plays atari at 'a', next B 'b', W 'c' and B 'd', Black can seal off White in sente, White is not good.]
;B[id];W[hc];B[di]LB[eh:a][ig:b]C[B73: Black can simply hane at 'a', next if W73, then B 'b'.];W[hf];B[ie];W[eg];B[eh];W[dg];B[fh];W[bc]LB[if:a]C[W80: White certainly should stick the head out at 'a'.]
;B[ig];W[ej]LB[be:a]C[W82 is a rare big mistake, White certainly should atari at 'a', although Black can seal off White, White is leading in territory, only if White handles the center stones, White can fight.];B[hg]C[After B83, White dies suddenly and can only concede defeat.])
