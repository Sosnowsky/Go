;W[ec];B[hd];W[cg];B[de];W[fm]LB[bq:a][em:b][di:c]C[W24: The opening is steady. Zhou Junjie 5p and Chang Hao 9p both think, White should play at 'a' with W24. The following variation is, Black needs to hane out at 'b', White takes chance to hane two stones then hang and can save W28, this is much better than the real game.];B[cn];W[bn];B[bq];W[di];B[dc]
;W[nc];B[pc]C[As to W30, the answer of B31 is too inconvenient. Zhou Junjie suggests, with B31 Black should pincer-attack W30. In the game, White's shape is too vivid.
¡¡¡¡];W[kc]C[From opening's perspective, today Peng Quan wants to delay the game to endgame fight, since the play of W30 and W32 are all relatively peaceful.];B[qm];W[ed];B[db]LB[ee:a][gc:b]C[The descent of B35 appears passive, Liu Xing thinks, now at any rate Black should play at 'a', White perhaps will make one-space jump at 'b'. In the game, White's shape is too adequate.];W[ee]C[W34 and W36 are good moves, Peng Quan's play is very positive today.];B[df];W[fg]
;B[dg];W[dh]C[Through W40, White's shape is vivid and can adequately fight. In terms of result, Black is a little passive. Chang Hao thinks, with B29 for Black to protect the corner at 30 is better.];B[bg];W[ch];B[cf];W[eb];B[jd];W[kd];B[je];W[ke];B[jg];W[kf];B[hg]
;W[eg]LB[ic:a]C[Yu Bin 9p thinks, W52 is not the best play, this is only a dame and not efficient. White should strike at 'a' and take advantage first, this way on the side White can crossover and at top White can connect out.];B[bh];W[bi]C[Through W54, Liu Xing thinks, the game already enters into Peng Quan's tempo. Gu Li also agrees, with current configuration, White can fight adequately at bottom.];B[ji];W[mq];B[lh];W[of];B[qf];W[pe];B[qe];W[oc]LB[nb:a]C[Through W62, Chang Hao thinks, the game will be decided in endgame. Gu Li said, Peng Quan generally will gain 2 points in endgame.

The purpose of W62 is to guard against Black's attachment at 'a'.]
;B[ir];W[jf];B[if];W[hi]LB[pb:a][da:b][pg:c]C[W66 is not simple enough, Chang Hao thinks, now White should play hane at 'a', then play hane at 'b', next make diagonal at 'c', this way White can easily win the game.];B[gh]C[After B67, the situation becomes complicated.];W[da];B[ca];W[ea];B[cb]LB[bb:a]C[B71: Gu Li thinks, Black should make tiger move at 'a'. In the game, if somehow B41 and B53 are being captured in ko fight, the whole group is dangerous, so White gets two more ko threats.]
;W[ih];B[ig];W[jh];B[gi];W[hj];B[gj];W[hk];B[kg]LB[ge:a][fe:b][eh:c]C[B79: Black misses a good chance to win the game at one stroke. Pros think, if Black makes diagonal at 'a', White needs to double at 'b', afterwards, White can cut at 'c'. White's big dragon in the upper right corner can make life but will suffer heavy loss. In the game, B79 lacks power.];W[ej];B[lj]
;W[pg]C[Through W82, White is closer to victory.];B[rh];W[pb];B[qb];W[pd];B[qc];W[pl];B[ql];W[pj];B[pi];W[oj];B[qi]C[Through B93, Zhou Junjie 5p and Liu Xiaoguang 9p think, so far Peng Quan's play is always not bad, but Black's territory is not small. Peng Quan needs to work very hard in order to win this game.]
;W[ic];B[nh];W[mi];B[li];W[mg];B[mh];W[lg]C[After W96, the purpose of W98 and W100 is to enclose territory at top. Chang Hao thinks, these several moves are a little crude, the whole board becomes thin, now the game is close.];B[kh];W[bo]C[W102: White takes more territory, it is a little relentless. If White's several stones in the center are killed, White may lose the game ......];B[no];W[mp];B[on]
