;B[cn];W[fq];B[kc]C[The play of B7 and B9 is very unique, the biggest character of Yamashita's style is that his opening conforms to no conventional pattern.];W[de]LB[rd:a]C[White approaches the corner with W10 and stresses on speed, the hane move at 'a' is steady.];B[dh];W[ec];B[eb];W[ed];B[fc];W[fb];B[db]LB[gb:a]C[B17: For Black to atari at 'a' is common, because Black is advantageous in strength and number of stones, Black connects and initiates a fight.]
;W[gb]LB[op:a]C[W18: White can also consider to play the ladder breaker by attaching at 'a'.];B[fd];W[fe];B[gd];W[bc]C[W22 is a good move! First see how Black answers, then decide how to play.];B[bb]LB[dd:a][bd:b][cd:c]TR[ec][ed]C[B23: If Black wants to capture W22, Black needs to atari at 'a' first, White connects, B 'b', this way White can wedge at 'c' and sacrifice one stone, White would be already satisfied, because the atari of B 'a' is too vulgar! If Black doesn't atari at 'a' and directly attaches at 'b' instead, White could hane at 'a' and elect to sacrifice the marked two white stones.]

;B[mc];W[ld]LB[ib:a]C[W38 is the only move, if White strengthens to live by playing at 'a', then Black takes at 38 and White would fail.];B[le];W[md];B[nd];W[me];B[ne];W[mf];B[mb];W[qe];B[oc];W[pd]
;B[nf];W[mg];B[hc];W[hb];B[ib];W[jb];B[fa]TR[qd]C[The sequence from B39 to B55 is inevitable, although Black has captured several white stones, but White can make use by reducing liberties, and also White has captured the marked black stone, so both sides has gained some profit.];W[cj];B[bd]LB[ab:a][ei:b][co:c]C[B57 is slow. Black obviously worries about White's tactic of making a ko by the hane move at 'a', in fact this is not that terrible. First, White must have adequate ko threats, second, even if Black gives way, Black can kill White by reducing liberties. Black should make the diagonal's extension at 'b', it is imperative! In the game after the addition of a white stone at 'c', the diagonal's extension is already one step late.]
;W[co];B[ei];W[bh];B[dk];W[dj];B[ej];W[ek];B[bo];W[bp];B[dl];W[fk];B[fm];W[cg]LB[hg:a]C[W70 is slack. White certainly should make the knight's move at 'a', Black would be in a bitter battle.]
;B[hg];W[hk];B[bm];W[ao];B[gh]C[After Black connects with B71 and B75, Black doesn't need to worry about capturing White by reducing liberties.];W[hm];B[an]C[Because of the ko fight at 77, Black's big group is quite resilient.];W[bn];B[gl]LB[gj:a][bi:b]C[But the diagonal's peep of B79 as a ko threat is too damaging! The jump at 'a' in sente has been forfeited, this has a big impact on the ensuing fight. Black should first find the ko threat by attaching at 'b'.];W[gk]
;B[bo];W[ia];B[ga];W[bn];B[bi];W[bj];B[bo];W[ng];B[ap];W[of]C[W88 and W90: White hanes in sente.];B[qb];W[rb];B[pb]
;W[aq]C[White ataris at 94 and continues to play the ko with Black, it is a strong play.];B[qm]C[B95: Because there are no proper ko threats, Black can't start the ko, to grab a big point is always the right choice.];W[ao];B[ci];W[di];B[ap];W[nq]LB[eh:a][ch:b]C[W100: White breaks away from the main battlefield! White should cut at 'a', completely capturing the three black stones, White would be favorable! In the game, White is left with a hidden trouble of B 'b', which is the key for this game.];B[gp]C[The shoulder hit of B101 is a good move!];W[ao]
;B[gq];W[jp];B[ap];W[qq]LB[eh:a]C[W106: White still should cut at 'a'.];B[pq];W[qp];B[po];W[pr];B[or];W[qr];B[oq];W[qo]

;W[mm];B[mn];W[ml];B[hn]LB[kj:a][ol:b]C[The atari of B155 can't be omitted, if Black simply nets at 'a', White tenukis to extend at 'b', if now Black ataris, White can give up.];W[gn];B[kj];W[mk];B[lj];W[pl];B[pm];W[oo]
;B[on];W[hr];B[hq];W[ho];B[ol];W[er];B[eq];W[dr];B[ch]C[The connection of B171 is the winning move! Capturing White's stones at the top is huge! The most important is that White needs to make life in gote.];W[eh];B[eg];W[fh];B[fg]
