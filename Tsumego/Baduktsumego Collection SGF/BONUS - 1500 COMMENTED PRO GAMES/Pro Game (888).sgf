Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[pd]C[Wang Lei 5p is a very brave player, he dares try "mirror go" in official games, recently he will play "Chinese Fuseki" whenever taking Black. In this Samsung preliminary final, he defeated Korean "Gold Kid" Kang Doonyoon 3p and advanced to the main event.];W[dd];B[pq];W[dq];B[qk]
;W[kq];B[cn];W[cp];B[ck];W[ci]C[The opening up to W10 was played by Kang Doonyoon recently, and he won that game, guess Wang Lei already saw that game.];B[em]LB[en:a]C[B11: Therefore Black starts to vary, Wang Xi probably first played this move, the common move is to jump at 'a'.];W[nc]C[W12: White takes tenuki, not sure how to deal with B11.];B[pf];W[pb];B[qc];W[kc]
;B[mq]LB[nq:a]C[But after B17, White's shape at the bottom is not good, and White is also hard to reinforce, so with W12 White should make the extension at 'a', it is bigger.];W[cf];B[fq]C[The invasion of B19 is severe, White is not easy to handle.];W[hq];B[lo];W[gp];B[ep];W[do];B[dp];W[eo];B[cq]
;W[bq];B[cr];W[co];B[dr];W[fn];B[bo];W[bp];B[bm]C[In the process up to B35, B25 is a good move, Black captures one stone with B27, Black's profit is huge, White incurs loss.];W[fp];B[eq];W[ok]C[The cap of W38 is a good point for reduction.];B[qi]
;W[qo];B[qp];W[op];B[pp];W[mp]LB[gl:a]C[But White's sequence from W40 to W44 appears not right-timing. With W40 White should first stick the head out at 'a' and aim to attack Black on the left side, then take chance to fight again on the right side, this is much better than the real game.];B[lq];W[lp];B[kp];W[nq];B[nr];W[mo];B[ko]
;W[mn];B[oq];W[kr];B[km];W[np];B[lr];W[po];B[gl]C[Through B59, White's big dragon is being sealed off, White's situation is not good.];W[ao];B[bn];W[hn];B[il];W[ec]C[Although W63 is big, it is not urgent.]
;B[io]C[After Black strengthens himself by exploiting White with B65, White at the bottom appears very thin and weak.];W[hr];B[ho];W[es];B[br];W[ar];B[ds];W[ks];B[jq];W[jr];B[iq];W[ir];B[go]
;W[fo];B[mr];W[fr];B[er];W[gr];B[bs];W[fs];B[ol]LB[ql:a]C[The push and pound of B85 is severe, White is difficult to handle, so with W64, White should play at 'a'.];W[ro];B[rq];W[pl];B[pk]
;W[om];B[nl];W[ql];B[nm]C[After B93, Black establishes superiority early in the game.];W[on]C[After this move, it is time for lunch break.];B[le];W[md];B[je]LB[nf:a][ld:b]C[But after B95, White gets into Black's territory by playing at 'a', B95 is a little questionable, Black should enclose territory at 'b'.];W[nf];B[mf]

;W[lb];B[kd];W[lc];B[ib];W[ka];B[cc];W[cd];B[eb];W[db];B[lj];W[ei];B[gh]C[After B137, Black's advantage is obvious.];W[gf]
;B[fb];W[dc];B[gd]LB[ic:a]C[B141 is a little questionable, Black should connect at 'a'.];W[ic];B[id];W[hc]C[W142 and W144: White captures one stone in sente, it is very big.
