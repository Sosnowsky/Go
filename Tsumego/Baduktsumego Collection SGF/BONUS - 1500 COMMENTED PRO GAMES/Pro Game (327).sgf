;B[ci];W[cc]C[After both sides have prepared this game for a long time, they all have some apprehensions, the opening up to W34 is steady and common.];B[gd];W[cb]C[Since Korean players loves territory, Chang Hao elects to take territory, which is correct thinking.];B[mp]C[The shoulder-hit of B37 is to serve as ladder breaker.];W[np];B[mo];W[lr];B[dd];W[de];B[ee];W[fe]
;B[fc]LB[ef:a]C[After playing two consecutive moves, with B45 Black suddenly realizes that there wouldn't be any good result even if Black runs out at 'a', so Black changes the tone and connects instead in the real game.];W[ef]LB[gf:a]C[After White takes with W46, White clearly takes advantage. However, for White to make diagonal at 'a' is more efficient.];B[cd];W[bd];B[be]C[B49: Black allows White to take ponnuki in order to capture W34 and W36 two stones, we have to say Black is too tenacious.];W[bf];B[bc];W[ae];B[bb]
;W[ql]LB[qo:a][pn:b][on:c]C[Through W54, White already takes the lead. White has a strong favorable consciousness. For White to make diagonal at 'a' is more positive, next B 'b' and W 'c'.];B[qp];W[qq];B[po]C[Black initiates a ko with B55 and B57, showing Korean players' sharp judgment on the game, if proceeding normally, Black will lose the game for sure.];W[rp];B[ro];W[qo];B[rc];W[sd]
;B[qp];W[ph]LB[pf:a]C[W64: For White to turn at 'a' is better, this way Black is not easy to find ko threats.];B[rq];W[qo];B[pc];W[pd];B[qp];W[qh]LB[oo:a][pr:b]C[W70 is clearly a mistake! White should first hang at 'a', forcing Black to take. Later on even if White wants to strengthen, White also should descend at 'b'.];B[pq]
;W[jq]C[The knight's move of W72 is being snubbed. The atari of B71 is very huge, White as a whole is not alive and can only make the knight's move with W72. This is all due to the mistake of W70.];B[qb];W[qd];B[og];W[pf];B[oc];W[nc];B[nb];W[mc];B[mb];W[lc];B[rb];W[kd]
;B[no]LB[qj:a]C[The turn of B85 is a thick play but slow. For Black to invade at 'a' is positive, White will be very difficult to handle.];W[pj]C[After White jumps with W86, White is leading in territory.];B[iq];W[ir];B[kq];W[kr];B[jp];W[jr];B[hq];W[or];B[fi]
;W[ji];B[jf];W[hf];B[jd];W[ke];B[je];W[jc];B[kf];W[hi];B[he];W[ab];B[db];W[hk]C[When W108, only if Black doesn't enclose a big territory in the middle, White wins the game for sure, but the following process is surprising.]
;B[fk];W[ac];B[ca];W[dh]LB[kk:a][jk:b]C[W112 is slow, White should play at 'a' or 'b' instead to reinforce White's stones in the center, Black definitely has no chance to win.];B[pk];W[qk];B[oj]C[B113 and B115 are all "urgent moves".];W[pi]LB[pl:a][ok:b][oh:c]C[The play of W116 is a little careless, White should first play atari at 'a' to probe Black, if Black connects at 'b', with W116 White can attach out at 'c', this will more echo the center.]
;B[gh];W[ch];B[le];W[kc];B[ij]C[From B121, Black starts to attack White, White still has a lot of chances to simplify the situation and keep the lead. But regrettably, Chang Hao plays a series of inexplicable moves.];W[jk];B[ik];W[il];B[jl];W[hj];B[hl];W[im];B[jj]
;W[kj];B[kk];W[ii];B[jk];W[gl];B[hm];W[gk];B[dq];W[cq];B[di];W[fj];B[bh];W[ig]LB[bg:a][ek:b]C[White connects back with dame, W142 is the losing move. White should cut at 'a' to capture B31 or play atari at 'b', White's big dragon certainly doesn't have life-and-death problem.]

;W[qr]LB[dk:a]C[W156 is wrong order! White should first peep at 'a', after Black reinforces the side with one move, then White can grab the big endgame with W156.];B[ek]C[B157: Black connects back one stone strongly! White needs to strengthen the center, here the gain or loss is huge.];W[li];B[lf];W[ne];B[op];W[rr];B[mq];W[mr];B[mi];W[ni]
;B[mj];W[mh];B[pl];W[er];B[fr];W[gr]LB[bj:a][bl:b]C[The play of W172 is common thinking, but in fact now White should peep at 'a', after Black connects, White can attach at 'b', although Black can connect in gote, but Black's loss is huge, White still can get to play W172.];B[gq];W[fs];B[bm]C[After B175, the situation has been finally turned around.];W[fq]
;B[fp];W[sq]LB[rm:a]C[W178: For White to play at 'a' is bigger, but it is not enough to change the result of the game.];B[rm];W[rl]C[Afterwards, White plays endgame hastily and concedes defeat.];B[ap];W[aq];B[qm];W[sl];B[nh];W[oi];B[mg]
