;B[pj];W[nc];B[pf];W[jd]C[The opening looks like a momentum fight, Hu Yaoyu knows Zhou Junxun loves territory, he still wants to play his own big moyo, his courage is worth admiring.];B[fq];W[hq]LB[hp:a]C[W12: White can consider to play high pincer at 'a'.];B[cn]C[B13: Black elects to play double approaching, this one joseki will decide the trend of the whole game.];W[fp];B[gp];W[gq];B[cp]
;W[cq];B[ep];W[fo];B[dq];W[do];B[eo];W[en];B[eq];W[dn];B[fn];W[go];B[co];W[dl]
;B[cr];W[bq];B[br];W[cm];B[bm];W[bl];B[an];W[ho];B[ck];W[cl]C[Through W40, most pros more like Black.];B[cc]LB[el:a]C[B41: Black completely executes his strategy, taking territory. However, I think Black can consider to probe White at 'a', White is a little painful.]
;W[cd];B[dc];W[fc];B[fb];W[ec];B[eb];W[gc];B[bd];W[be];B[bc];W[cf];B[jj]C[B53: Black takes a good point, the game enters into Zhou's tempo.];W[lp]LB[lj:a]C[W54 is a very bad move! It is the root cause of White's defeat in this game. Now White can only play at 'a' to separate Black's one stone. Normally I believe Hu Yaoyu wouldn't make this kind of mistake.]
;B[mo]C[Being knighted by B55, White instantly becomes very inconvenient.];W[kn];B[lm];W[km]C[W56 and W58: White has to play near his steel wall, very painful!];B[kl]LB[lk:a]C[B59 is not necessary, if simply jumping to 'a', Black is already very favorable for the game.];W[ll]C[White cuts with W60, hoping to find a chance and fight.];B[ln];W[lo];B[ko]C[The cut of B63 is clever move.];W[jo]LB[jn:a]C[Even if painful, with W64 White can only turn at 'a', this way the situation would be still complicated.]
;B[jn]C[Next the cut and atari of B65 is beautiful.];W[jm];B[jl]C[Black gets to play atari with B67 in sente.];W[kp];B[lj]C[B69: Black again jumps, easily mitigating White's pound.];W[nn]C[The strike of W70 is good move.];B[no]C[B71 is strong and unyielding, not giving up an inch.];W[qj];B[qk];W[pk]C[W72 and W74: White continues to mess up the situation.]
;B[qi];W[rj];B[rk];W[lk];B[mn];W[mj];B[li];W[mi]LB[oj:a][pi:b]C[But next the attachment of W82 is the losing move. White must first exchange, W 'a' and B 'b', this way the situation is still not to White's advantage, but White would still have chances.];B[oj]C[After Black extends with B83, the game is over.];W[nk]
;B[mh];W[nh];B[kk];W[oi];B[ok];W[lh];B[mg];W[of];B[oe];W[nf];B[nl]C[B87, B89 and B95: Black elects to play simply, already seeing the light of victory.];W[pg];B[qf]
;W[kh];B[nj];W[ni];B[mk];W[ii];B[gk]LB[md:a]C[B103: Black should make knight at 'a'.];W[ne];B[oc];W[nb];B[og];W[ng];B[gb]LB[fj:a]C[B109: Black should make diagonal at 'a'.]
;W[hk];B[hl];W[hj];B[gl];W[fr];B[er];W[es];B[dr];W[ej]C[White encloses territory with W118, the situation becomes much closer.];B[hc];W[hd];B[ic]C[However, the board also becomes smaller and smaller.]
;W[id];B[mq];W[lr];B[ob]C[In the end, Black plays flawlessly in the endgame.];W[nr];B[or];W[nq];B[oq]C[Finally Hu Yaoyu didn't cross over this half-point natural moat.];W[os];B[ps];W[ns];B[pr]
