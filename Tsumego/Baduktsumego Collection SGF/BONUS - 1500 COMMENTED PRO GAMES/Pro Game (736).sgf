Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[pd]C[In the first round of the 10th Samsung Cup, 5 out of 9 Chinese players get to advance to the next round. This game is between Luo Xihe (Black) of China and Jo HanSeung of Korea.];W[dd];B[qp];W[dq];B[oq]
;W[co];B[qg]LB[pj:a]C[B7 protecting the corner with the large knight's move is Luo Xihe's unique style, to connect all together at 'a' is relatively common.];W[jp];B[cf];W[fc];B[bd];W[ic];B[cc];W[mq];B[hq];W[iq];B[hp]
;W[in];B[fn]LB[eq:a][ep:b][dr:c]C[The dodging sequence following B19 is also very unique. The general thinking, is with B19 to attach at 'a', next if White hanes at 'b', then Black will counter-hane at 'c'.];W[fq];B[fp];W[ep];B[fr];W[fo];B[go];W[gp];B[gq]
;W[fp];B[ho];W[kn]C[The jump of W30 is the original shape. So far, it seems White can be satisfied.];B[hm];W[fl];B[ci]C[B33: Black takes tenuki and is positive. The two-space extension of B33 contains White's development of thickness.];W[en];B[hk];W[jk];B[er];W[dr];B[ir]
;W[jr];B[hs];W[qc];B[pc];W[qd];B[qe];W[re];B[rf];W[pe];B[qf];W[pb];B[ob];W[rp]C[The attachment of W52 is an asking move and White also aims to create ko threats. If Black continues to answer, then White will take advantage or obtain some ko threats.]
;B[qb]C[Black takes tenuki resolutely, it is understandable.];W[qq];B[ro];W[pp];B[qo];W[pq];B[rq];W[rr];B[sp];W[on];B[pm]C[Through B63, the result of exchange is to White's advantage.];W[oe]
;B[nd];W[og];B[jc]C[B67: Black seeks to strengthen the cut in sente.];W[jb]C[Following W68, White starts to counterattack, it again leads to an eye-dazzling exchange.];B[kb];W[kc];B[jd];W[lb];B[ib];W[ka];B[hc];W[od]
;B[oc];W[nc]C[White pushes and cuts with W76 and W78 to take advantage in sente, White is happy.];B[nb];W[mc];B[rc];W[df];B[dg];W[eg]LB[ef:a][id:b][ke:c]C[Following W84, White ends in gote, it is hard to understand. With W84, White should extend at 'a', next B 'b' and W 'c', this way White is favorable for the game.];B[id]
;W[dh];B[cg];W[ff];B[ne]C[The attachment of B89 is severe, the situation becomes chaotic.];W[kd];B[jf];W[nf];B[of];W[pf];B[pg];W[of];B[me];W[kf]
;B[oh];W[if];B[mf];W[je]C[Through W102, it forms another exchange, how Black to dodge himself is the key for the game.];B[fd];W[dc];B[eb];W[fb];B[gd]C[The dodging sequence from B103 to B107 is fresh and new. Luo Xihe's talent is really extraordinary.];W[be]C[W108 is also a good local move. Otherwise, White locally already has no good shape.];B[ce];W[de]
;B[ie];W[jg];B[hf];W[cd];B[bf];W[bc];B[ae];W[hg];B[gf];W[cb]LB[om:a][gg:b]C[W120 is the losing move, it is not very big. White should press at 'a', this way White's situation is not bad. Locally with W120 White should press at 'b', Black's descent at 120 is not working, this makes one move difference from the real game.];B[jo]
;W[pn];B[qm];W[io];B[om]C[After Black presses with B125, the situation already turns to Black's advantage.];W[ck];B[eh];W[mj]C[The reduction following W128 is also worth study.];B[ni];W[ok];B[nn];W[op];B[nl]
;W[nk];B[ml];W[kj];B[pk]C[Through B137, Black is leading a lot in territory.];W[bj];B[fg];W[ef];B[dk];W[dl];B[ds];W[cs];B[es];W[cr]
;B[cj];W[bl];B[np];W[nq];B[mp];W[lq];B[ip];W[jq];B[bi]C[After this move, it is time for lunch break.];W[oj];B[pj];W[oi];B[pi]
;W[hn];B[gn];W[gm];B[gs];W[ek];B[hh];W[gg]LB[ei:a]C[W166 is the game-deciding move, for White to simply atari at 'a' is relatively common, but White's territory is inadequate.];B[fh];W[di];B[dj];W[ge];B[he]
;W[ej];B[gh];W[ei];B[ig];W[ag]C[After White strikes with W176, locally it is ko-killing.];B[aj];W[ak];B[bk];W[hr];B[gr];W[bj];B[bh];W[ac]
;B[bk];W[mh];B[ng];W[bj];B[ah];W[ad];B[bk];W[qn];B[cl]C[B193: Black eliminates the ko, it is correct judgement, the situation already has no suspense.];W[rn];B[rm];W[sn];B[cm]
