;W[ce];B[qj];W[nc];B[pf];W[pb];B[mc]LB[qc:a]C[When the left side is white, the play of B11 is somewhat unreasonable, for Black to make diagonal at 'a' is common.];W[md];B[lc];W[od];B[oe];W[pc]C[W14 and W16 are novel moves.]
;B[ne];W[qd];B[nd];W[pe];B[qe];W[pd];B[qf];W[nb];B[le]C[Through B25, the result is about even.];W[fq]C[But since White's configuration is better on the left side, White is not bad for the whole game.];B[jp]LB[oo:a]C[W26 induces Black to expand on both sides with B27, White aims to cap at 'a'.]
;W[oo]C[In this shape, the play of W28 is a superb move, Black is painful and has no good answer.¡£];B[np]LB[pn:a][nq:b]C[If B29 at 'a', then White will attach at 'b', Black is also not good.];W[pk]C[W30 is good move.];B[qk];W[pl];B[ql]C[White condenses Black strongly to a low position, White's shape is smooth.];W[pp];B[pq];W[qo]
;B[qm];W[no];B[mo];W[mn];B[lo];W[qn]LB[pm:a]C[W42: If White plays at 'a' first, then B42, White is not easy to handle.];B[rp];W[pm]C[W42 and W44 are beautiful tactic to fix shape.];B[ml]LB[ck:a]C[B45: In fact, Black already couldn't possibly attack this white group, to split at 'a' and conduct a long war is common.]
;W[pj];B[pi];W[oi];B[mi];W[ln];B[kn];W[ll];B[lm]C[White forces Black to wedge and cut with B53.];W[mm];B[km];W[nl];B[mk];W[nk]C[White takes chance to play W56 and W58, this group is already alive in sente.]
;B[mj];W[dj]C[White successfully grabs the big point with W60.];B[cl];W[ck];B[dl];W[fj]C[W64 is simple and clear, now only if Black doesn't form a big territory in the center, White will be leading in territory.];B[bp];W[cq];B[ff];W[fd];B[dg]C[B67 and B69: Black clearly notices his unfavorable situation, but since Black at the bottom is not settled, these moves are a little unreasonable.];W[fm]C[W70 is severe!]
;B[do];W[co];B[cn];W[dn];B[eo];W[bn]C[Next W72, W74 and W76 are very tight, Lee Sedol gives a full play to his very strong talent on close-contact fighting.];B[ep];W[cp];B[eq]C[B77 and B79: Black has no choice but to turn body around.];W[en]C[W80: But White captures the left side and gains a lot.];B[cm]C[B81: Black probes White.]
;W[er]C[W82: White counterattacks intensely.];B[fo];W[dq];B[gq];W[go]C[Next the bump of W86 is severe.];B[fr];W[fn];B[fp];W[gp];B[fq];W[bo]C[White wraps up in sente and then comes back with W92, Black didn't gain any advantage.];B[gn]
;W[gl];B[hn];W[fh]C[W96 is the vital point for the shape, Choi Cheolhan must feel very painful.];B[fg];W[eh];B[ci];W[cj];B[de];W[cf];B[dd]LB[df:a]C[B103: Knowing it is unreasonable, Black still plays this way, since if Black connects at 'a', White will be very happy to hit at 103.];W[cd]
;B[ec];W[df];B[db];W[cc];B[ed];W[fe]C[W110: They again starts close-contact fight, Lee Sedol rarely loses in this kind of places.];B[ef];W[ee];B[fc];W[hd];B[hb];W[hf]C[W116 is vital point.]

;B[oj];W[nj];B[mh];W[lb];B[ni];W[oh];B[qh]C[B161: Black can't kill White strongly, otherwise if White descends at 161, Black itself will be in tatters.];W[ro];B[el]C[B163 finally tests Lee Sedol's calculation skill.];W[fl];B[ek];W[jk]
;B[jj];W[kk];B[ii];W[jm];B[kl];W[jn]C[W166 and B172 give beautiful answer.];B[lk]LB[ko:a][im:b]C[B173: Black seeks a way to concede, if B 'a' or 'b', since Black can't tight liberty, left side is also going to die.];W[ko];B[kj];W[io]
