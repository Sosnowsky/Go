Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[In the round 2, Chang Hao 9p lost to Wang Yao 6p and again lost the right to challenge Meijin.];W[dc];B[pp];W[dp];B[ce]
;W[oc];B[md];W[mc]LB[lc:a][ld:b]C[Generally speaking, next if Black plays at 'a', White will crosscut at 'b', Black is difficult to play.];B[nd]C[B9: Therefore Black releases novel move.];W[nc]C[But in terms of result, Black clearly incurs loss, so new move failed.];B[ld]C[Mingren is national tournament, it is just a good time to think and play boldly. If it were international tournament, I guess Chang Hao wouldn't try this new move easily.];W[pe]C[The knight of W12 is severe.];B[pd]LB[qe:a]C[B13: Black has no other choices, if crawling at 'a', the three stones on the outside are hard to handle.]
;W[od];B[oe];W[lc];B[kd];W[qe];B[re];W[rd];B[rc];W[sd]C[W22 is tesuji.];B[pf]LB[sc:a][qc:b]C[B23 is the only move. If B 'a', White will wrap up at 'b' to force Black to form a cramped shape, the game will be over immediately.]
;W[qf];B[rf];W[qg];B[pb]LB[qc:a][rg:b][sc:c]C[The original move of B27 is to play at 'a', after W 'b' and B 'c', W27 is sente, Black is also not good.];W[rb];B[qc];W[qb];B[pc];W[pa];B[ob]
;W[nb];B[sc];W[oa];B[se];W[rg];B[sg]C[B39: Black is tenacious.];W[sh]LB[rh:a][kc:b]C[If W40 at 'a', then B 'b', it will form ko-killing in the corner, White is also painful.];B[rh];W[sf];B[sb]
;W[kc];B[sg];W[qh];B[jd];W[ib];B[si];W[of];B[ne];W[qj];B[ql];W[hd];B[og];W[ri]
;B[ra];W[oi]C[In the game, White's play to settle the shape is very good.];B[nf]C[Through B59, in originally Black's corner, White gets to play on both sides, now White is simply favorable.];W[jq];B[cn];W[fp];B[gd]C[The play of B63 is an unusual tactic.];W[de]LB[hc:a]C[As to this, W64 is mistake and helps Black give up stones beautifully. White should tolerate at 'a'.];B[dd]C[B65 is good move.];W[ed]
;B[cd];W[ee];B[ec];W[fc];B[eb];W[db];B[hb]C[B73 is clever move.];W[hc];B[ic];W[gb];B[df];W[co];B[dn]
;W[cj];B[he]C[B81 again is clever move. Black takes so much advantage and inside is still left with some weird ko, locally Chang Hao has played very well.];W[ge]C[However, overall for the game, the situation is still to White's advantage, Black is way behind in the opening.];B[jb];W[jc];B[ia];W[id];B[ie];W[gc];B[cb];W[fb];B[cc]
;W[ea];B[ch];W[cl];B[kb];W[ib];B[cq];W[bp]LB[bo:a]C[As to B97, W98 is good move and better than descending at 'a'.];B[er];W[dq];B[dr];W[cr];B[br]
;W[bq];B[fq];W[gq];B[gr];W[gp];B[cs];W[hr];B[ar];W[nq];B[fm]LB[pq:a][qq:b]C[B113: For Black to protect the corner at 'a' is better, after White takes corner at 'b', Black's territory is inadequate.];W[fk]
;B[hm];W[qq];B[qp];W[pq];B[op];W[oq];B[ic];W[sj]LB[qn:a]C[After Black takes ko with B121, White takes tenuki and W122 looks weird, in fact it is a strong and good move. Because after W122, W 'a' can create numerous ko threats, White is no longer fearful of the ko at top.];B[bm];W[mo];B[hk];W[qn]
;B[pn];W[rn];B[rq];W[rr];B[qm];W[on];B[pm];W[rp];B[ro];W[sq];B[qo];W[bl];B[eo]
;W[ep];B[ho];W[ib]C[After making a circle, White turns back and reinforces with W142, White's advantage becomes more obvious.];B[jp];W[kp];B[ic];W[gs];B[fr];W[ib];B[iq];W[ip];B[hp];W[hq]
;B[io];W[jr];B[ic];W[lb];B[ma];W[ib];B[ko];W[lo];B[ic];W[ka];B[na];W[ib];B[bj]C[When B165, White only needs to settle this one weak group to win the game.]
;W[em];B[en];W[fl]C[Following W168, White makes trouble for himself, which is really unnecessary.];B[dm];W[gm];B[el]C[The fight following B171 is just what Black is looking for.];W[gn]C[However, even if playing this way, White also has assurance of success. Overall, White is good at fight.];B[go];W[fo];B[fn];W[hl];B[il]

Black can only connect back at 'a', next W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 'e' and W 'f', this way Black makes life in gote. However even like this, since White can push at 'g' and Black can't block, White still will win the game.]
;W[pj];B[oi];W[nm]C[White captures key stones with W228, Black already can't continue the game.])
