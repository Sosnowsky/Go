Copyright by gogameworld.com and weiqi.tom.com.]RE[W+2.5];B[qd]C[Since when all other Go players comment, Chinese players seem to lose more, so today I will comment and hope Yu Bin can win :-)];W[pp];B[dd];W[cp];B[nq]
;W[lp];B[no];W[pn];B[pr];W[qq];B[lr];W[mo];B[nn];W[qk]C[W14: Cho Hunhyun will make the small knight's extension in this situation.];B[eq];W[od];B[md];W[kc]
;B[op];W[do];B[qi]LB[ql:a]C[B21: Black aims to play at 'a'.];W[of];B[qf];W[qc]LB[fp:a]C[W24 to W26: White puts emphasis on settling the shape, reducing Black's power of thickness, White wants very much to play at 'a'.];B[rc];W[pd];B[qb]LB[eo:a]C[Black can consider to attach up at 'a'.]
;W[pc];B[re];W[rb];B[pb];W[ob];B[ra];W[ld]C[Through W34, the situation is steady, Black's thickness has potential, Yu Bin's Black is not bad.];B[ql]LB[fp:a]C[The timing of B35 is very difficult to control, I feel it is a little early, if Black ends in gote, White will first play at 'a'.];W[pl];B[rk];W[qm]
;B[rl]C[White's set pattern in the upper right corner is to counter B35.];W[cf];B[fc];W[fp]C[Through W42, it seems White is relatively easy to play.];B[ci];W[ck];B[gq];W[cd];B[cc];W[bc]LB[rm:a]C[Black can find a chance to start attack at 'a'.];B[ce]
;W[bd];B[de];W[be];B[cb];W[df];B[bg];W[bf];B[ei]C[Black doesn't give an inch, the shape is a little thin, but White is also not easy to control.];W[gp];B[hq];W[hp]C[W60: White is hard to decide whether jumping out in the upper left corner or making the two-space extension at the top, so White first presses with two moves to threaten Black. Through W60, I feel White is a little better.];B[ip]C[B61 is unexpected, the common move is to extend, here if it leads to a fierce fight, White is also not comfortable, Black may not have time to attack on the left side.]
;W[fq];B[fr];W[iq];B[dr]C[The purpose of B65 is not allowing White to sacrifice W64, taking the chance to tangle with White, however  locally White is clearly favorable, Black still needs one move in the corner.];W[ir];B[hr];W[hs];B[gr]C[After this move, it is time for lunch break.];W[jp]LB[kq:a][ep:b][eo:c][io:d][cq:e][kr:f]C[W70: White elects to play a steady set pattern. If White makes the diagonal at 'a', next B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e' and B 'f', this variation is complicated, White has no assurance of success.]
;B[io];W[kr];B[ep];W[eo];B[cq];W[bq];B[br];W[dp];B[dq];W[gn];B[lq];W[kq];B[qr]C[Black again grabs territory, also Black has some tactic at the bottom, in terms of result, B61 is very successful, now the game seems to be long one.]
;W[rm];B[om];W[pk];B[rj];W[pm];B[rq];W[rp];B[sr];W[nk];B[jo];W[ko];B[jm];W[ll]
;B[jk]C[If Black can successfully handle his two weak groups, Black can win the game. At the top, both sides want to play two-space extension. Now how White to strengthen is very difficult.];W[ek]C[W98: White strives for W98, it seems White is not optimistic, now let's see how Yu Bin pounds at the center.];B[ml];W[mk];B[lm];W[mm];B[kl]LB[mn:a]C[B103: If Black plays at 'a', White can atari then wedge, Black is reluctant, now Black wants to take the chance and gain benefit.];W[nl];B[fk];W[fl];B[gk]
;W[ej];B[fi]C[Black handles very well in the center, two weak groups have connected and Black also obtains some points.];W[hc]C[W110 is the last big point, however White dares not push and cut, Black is very happy. Now the situation is to Black's advantage.];B[gl];W[mq];B[mr];W[mp];B[fe];W[bb];B[id];W[ic];B[jd]
;W[jc];B[ba]C[Now Black has more territory and plays endgame in sente, Black is optimistic.];W[ff];B[ge];W[gf];B[hf];W[hg];B[ef];W[eg];B[ee];W[bh];B[ch];W[cg]
;B[bi];W[he]C[If White wants to capture B55 and makes life, it equals to dying peacefully, the counterattack is inevitable.];B[if];W[gg]LB[cm:a]C[Now on the left side there is aji at 'a' inside White's territory, White can't attach and take B55 to make life, White can't tolerate with Black's all sente moves, White wants to stick his head out.];B[ig]LB[hd:a][hh:b]C[B137: If Black captures W134, then White will play at 137, Black forces White to make life. Now if W 'a', then B 'b', White is not good.];W[ih];B[hh]LB[mn:a][kn:b][gh:c]C[Black cuts with B139 to form a capturing race, Cho U is indeed very tenacious. B 'a', W 'b', in this area Black has many sente moves, now White is very painful, if White plays atari and push at 'c', after Black blocks, Black takes on the first line, Black is not afraid of capturing race, if White makes life, W138 is a big damaging move.]
;W[gh];B[hi];W[hd];B[fg];W[fh];B[eh];W[dg];B[gi];W[fg];B[le]C[B149: Black is relentless, with W140 White wants to take two-point advantage but now White suffers a fatal attack.];W[ag]C[Now Black lives at the top, White is hard to look after both the top and the left side.];B[gb]C[W150 again is miscalculation, Black makes the diagonal of B151 in sente, it makes a big difference in points.]
;W[hb];B[ga];W[jh];B[kg];W[kh];B[mg];W[lh];B[nc];W[me];B[ne]C[White's sequence following W138 is very vicious, now Black's victory is not far away.];W[nd];B[mc];W[mf]
;B[nf];W[lf];B[lg];W[ke];B[kf];W[le];B[ng];W[oc];B[oe];W[pe];B[pf];W[mb];B[np]
;W[kj];B[fm];W[el];B[gm];W[bo];B[aq];W[hn]C[W184 is a desperate move, Yu Bin should be careful.];B[bl];W[bk];B[ak];W[cl];B[aj];W[im]
;B[jn]LB[kn:a]C[B177: Black perhaps is soft-hearted, now the situation is not clear, B191 should be at 'a'.];W[il];B[jj];W[ln];B[kk];W[km];B[jl];W[bm];B[ah];W[ai];B[jq]C[B201 is small, Black should find ko threats in the center, Black wins the game for sure if capturing five stones.]

;B[ij];W[nh];B[og];W[qo];B[pq];W[qp];B[ho];W[go];B[kn];W[lm];B[lo]C[Regrettably, in the second half of the game, the situation is chaotic and Black is also soft-hearted, eventually Black lost a good game.];W[mn]C[Sorry to Tom friends, it seems my luck is not good either, thanks!]
