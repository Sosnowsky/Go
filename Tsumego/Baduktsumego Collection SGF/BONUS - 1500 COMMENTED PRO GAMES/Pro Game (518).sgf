;W[oc];B[ld]C[The opening from B1 to B7 is often used by Gu Li recently.];W[qn]C[As to this, Liu Xing is also prepared with the strategy in the real game.];B[pk];W[nq];B[pn];W[qq];B[pq];W[qp];B[po];W[rm];B[qm]
;W[qo];B[ql];W[pr];B[or];W[qr];B[pc]LB[pe:a][md:b]C[As to the diagonal of B23, after the knight of W 'a', the attachment at 'b' is common nowadays.];W[dg];B[ee];W[fd];B[hc];W[cd]
;B[be];W[pe];B[pd];W[md];B[od]C[B33: Black has many choices, but it is difficult to judge which one is better.];W[le];B[mc]LB[kd:a]C[However, B33 and B35 in the game are definitely questionable moves. At least with B35 Black should retreat at 'a'.];W[fe];B[ef];W[id]C[The shoulder-hit of W38 becomes an excellent move.];B[kd]
;W[ic]TR[hc]C[The earlier B27 (the marked stone) is being separated, White succeeds in the opening.];B[di]LB[ch:a]C[The original move of B41 is to make extension at 'a'.];W[hd];B[cn]LB[ng:a]C[B43 and B45: Black should enclose at around 'a' to ensure basic territory.];W[fq];B[bp]C[B41, B43 and B45 are all overplays.];W[me]C[W46 is strong!]
;B[ke]LB[nf:a]C[B47: Black can only fly out at 'a' to seek exchange.];W[lg];B[kf]C[B47 and B49: Black sails the boat against the tide.];W[ng];B[jb];W[ib];B[lf];W[mf];B[mh];W[mg];B[nd]
;W[ph]C[Through W58, White achieves a big success.];B[oq];W[jp];B[lq]LB[no:a]C[B61: Black has no choice but to invade at this small place, however White jumps to 'a', Black's thickness becomes unstable and Black can't tolerate.];W[bg]TR[di]C[B62 is a planned strategy, which is reserved after the pincer of B41.];B[ch];W[cg];B[eg];W[cj];B[ci]
;W[bj]LB[bi:a][eh:b]C[After W66 and W68, with B69 Black can't block at 'a', otherwise White plays hane out at 'b', Black has to reduce liberties and is too painful!];B[fi];W[cl];B[en];W[el];B[bi];W[ei]LB[eh:a]C[The wedge of W74 is a good move! For Black to retreat at 'a' is too inconvenient.];B[ej];W[eh]
;B[fh];W[dh];B[dj];W[fj];B[ah];W[gj];B[ag]C[After White cuts with W80, Black is forced to reduce liberties with B81 and B83, so perhaps early on for Black to retreat at 76 is better.];W[cq];B[bq];W[fg];B[gh];W[hh];B[gg]
;W[ff];B[hi];W[fn];B[fo];W[gn];B[em];W[fl];B[dd];W[ed];B[de];W[ii]C[In a favorable situation, White starts to play conservatively, White's questionable moves are unstoppable.];B[hg];W[ih]
;B[if];W[jg];B[jf]C[White shouldn't exchange from W100 to B105.];W[bd];B[cc];W[bc];B[cb];W[bb];B[db];W[ec];B[ba];W[eb];B[kg]

;B[do];W[bo];B[co];W[cm];B[ao];W[dk]LB[af:a][bf:b][gl:c][ek:d]TR[fj][gj]C[With W144 and W146, White should first exchange W 'a' and B 'b', this way when Black plays at 'c', White can reduce liberties at 'd' in sente and treat W80 and W82 (the two marked stones) lightly.];B[gl]
;W[hk];B[ik];W[hl];B[ir]C[B151 is a game-deciding move!];W[fp];B[iq]C[Gu Li is very alert to win/loss.];W[jq];B[ip];W[js]LB[af:a][hm:b][ek:c][io:d][gk:e][am:f]C[W156 is the losing move! White should play hane at 'a', this way when B 'b', White can settle the shape in sente at 'c', then play at 'd', Black dares not cut at 'e', since after W 'f', Black's corner will get captured.]
