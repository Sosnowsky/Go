;W[hq];B[jr];W[fp];B[dq]LB[eq:a]TR[hq]C[B21 is a variation in the current situation when Black is very thick on the right side, if playing by joseki, Black extends at 'a', White will happily block at 21, sacrificing the marked leftover stone in sente.];W[eq];B[er];W[ep];B[cq];W[fr];B[bo];W[dr]
;B[cr];W[es];B[co];W[dn];B[ar]C[Through B33, the local exchange comes to an end, both sides have gained some profit, but White obtains sente and can be satisfied.]
(;W[ce]LB[nc:a][pf:b][kd:c][de:d][ee:e]C[W34: For White to approach at 'a' first is more positive, followed by B 'b', W 'c', B 'd' and W 'e' (see var a).];B[ic];W[nc];B[oc];W[nd];B[pf];W[kc];B[fc]C[The sequence up to B41 is almost one-way street, it already leads to a situation where they have to fight their "inner strength" in the second half of the game.]

;B[jb];W[ld]LB[kd:a]C[W56 is no better than the direct connection at 'a', being hit by Black here White is always not comfortable.];B[ke];W[kd];B[eb];W[qc];B[qd];W[ob];B[pb];W[pc];B[qb];W[od]
;B[rc];W[de];B[cj];W[ch];B[ej];W[ph];B[ok];W[nh];B[lj]C[B75 is a good point! The thinness and thickness in the center is very important.];W[bn]C[W76 is also a thick play, first cutting Black's way back, automatically there will be a loophole in the center.];B[eh];W[ci]
;B[dj];W[ff];B[hj];W[jj];B[dg];W[cg];B[lh];W[qf]C[Although W86 is a little damaging, but White has to play this way to obtain sente.];B[qg];W[pg];B[rf];W[of];B[qe]

;B[fi];W[ji];B[fj];W[ii]C[With the sequence from W96 to W108, White captures one stone, becomes thick and also threatens Black's big dragon. So far White is a little favorable for the game.];B[kg];W[im]LB[fg:a][if:b][nj:c][li:d]C[W110 is not good and almost a dame! White should simply peep at 'a', then jump to 'b'.  This way not only White exploits Black's big dragon, the most important is that next White jumps to 'c' and can aim at the severe tactic of wedge and cut at 'd', Black is hard to resist.];B[ee]C[After B111, Black basically has connected.];W[lm]LB[nj:a]C[Although White is happy with the sente move of W112, but the aji of jump to 'a' is also lost, here White has incurred some loss.]

;W[oe];B[me];W[md];B[oc];W[gb];B[ga];W[pc]LB[oa:a]C[White takes with W156 and falls into a trap, White should descend at 'a', this way White is favorable by 1 point!];B[bj];W[bi];B[cf];W[bf];B[ma]C[The strike of B161 is a clever move! Black takes almost 2 points advantage.]
;W[na];B[mb];W[mc];B[rm];W[rn];B[ql];W[ho]LB[fl:a]C[W168: White perhaps should first peep at 'a', then protect at 168.];B[fl];W[do];B[cs];W[os];B[ns]

Originally if White descends at 'a', Black can only atari at 'b', now after the push of W202, if W 'a', Black can connect at 'c', here White again has incurred a small loss. So far, the outcome of White's small defeat for the game can be changed.];B[rh];W[bk];B[bl];W[al];B[cl];W[mj];B[bb]
