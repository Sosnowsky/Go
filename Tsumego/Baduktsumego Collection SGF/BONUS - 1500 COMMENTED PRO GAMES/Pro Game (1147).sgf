;W[cf];B[db];W[od];B[oc];W[nc];B[pc];W[nd];B[pe];W[hc]C[The first 14 moves are quite normal.];B[cc]C[Through B15, basically it forms the situation of White's outside influence vs. Black's territory.
];W[ec]LB[fd:a][gd:b]C[W16: White should simply press at 'a' instead, next B16 and W 'b', this way Black will have one less ladder breaker, White's efficiency is relatively higher.]
;B[eb];W[fd];B[gd];W[gc];B[fb];W[ge];B[nf];W[jd];B[qn]C[Black is able to take two good points with B23 and B25, Black can be satisfied.];W[kq];B[fq];W[eq];B[fp]

;B[op];W[os];B[cl];W[bn];B[qi]LB[pj:a]C[The position of B47 is a little weird, the common move is to make high extension at 'a'.];W[oi];B[ci];W[og];B[of];W[pg]C[Black maybe fears White's invasion, but White gets to destroy territory with W50 and W52, Black is definitely not good.];B[pk]
;W[fr];B[gr];W[er]C[The connection of W54 and W56 are very big.];B[li]LB[le:a][ke:b]C[B57: Before attacking, Black should first make the exchange by making the knight's move at 'a' and extension at 'b' in sente.];W[ok];B[pl];W[mh];B[le];W[ld];B[ke]LB[mf:a]C[After White attaches out alertly with W64, the exchange of B57 and W60 is clearly damaging, also White is still left with the tactic of attaching at 'a', Black is very uncomfortable.]

;W[ng];B[ne];W[ol];B[kk];W[ik]C[Following W94, it leads to an eye-dazzling offense and defense fight. Perhaps only Luo Xihe himself can get hold of it.];B[ij]C[B95: Black fixes his shape by borrowing strength.];W[in]C[The attachment of W96 is a good move! If Black is allowed to connect easily, White's situation is not good.];B[ln];W[om];B[pj];W[mk];B[mo]
;W[kl];B[jj];W[pm];B[qm];W[kn];B[lp]LB[hn:a]C[B107: Black should simply hane at 'a', the play in the real game gives White a chance to show tesujis.];W[jq];B[hn];W[mp]LB[jo:a]C[W110 looks like a "cheating move", to simply bump at 'a' is the original move.];B[lo]LB[no:a][im:b]C[B111: Black unexpectedly connects! B111 is the losing move of the game, since White can wedge at 'a', at any rate Black can't tolerate. With B111 if Black ataris at 'b', the situation is still hard to judge. In the real game, whenever White plays at 'a', it is the time Black will incur a big defeat.

After this move, it is time for lunch break.]
