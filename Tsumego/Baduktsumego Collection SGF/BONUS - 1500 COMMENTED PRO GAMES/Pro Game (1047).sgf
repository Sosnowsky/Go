;B[fq];W[cn];B[pk];W[eq];B[fp];W[jp];B[lp];W[jn];B[fm];W[dm];B[im]C[Through 15, the situation is the same as this year's 57th Honinbo Title game 6 between O Meien and Kato Masao.];W[jm]LB[ln:a][kl:b][mq:c]C[W16 starts to change, Kato pressed at 'a' in their game, followed by B 'b', W 'c', from the later result it seems Black can fight.]
;B[jl];W[go]C[W18 is a test move.];B[ho]LB[fo:a][gn:b][fn:c][il:d]C[If B19 was at 'a', then W 'b', B 'c' and White will cut at 'd', not good for Black.];W[nq]C[W20 invades immediately, its purpose is to test Black's moves then decide how to play on the left.];B[io]C[B21 aims to enforce himself in sente.];W[no]C[After W22, each side plays his own way.];B[jo]
;W[po];B[fc];W[cf];B[mc];W[qp]C[Through 28, White's territory is more solid, the central issue is how Black convert the upper thickness to territory.];B[fe];W[ec];B[fb];W[qf];B[qh];W[qc];B[qd];W[rd]
;B[pc]LB[re:a][rc:b][qe:c][ob:d]C[If W37 block at 'a', then W 'b', B 'c', and W 'd', Black is not satisfied.];W[rb];B[qb];W[rc];B[qe]C[B41 is obvious to expand his moyo.];W[re];B[pf];W[if]C[W44 is a safe place to reduce Black's moyo.]
;B[id];W[jh];B[on];W[oo];B[nr]C[B49 is a good move.];W[or]LB[mr:a][mq:b][rq:c]C[W50 is the right move, if hane at 'a', Black will play at 50, White connect at 'b', Black jump at 'c' to make his corner alive, White's loss outweights the gain.];B[mr];W[oq]C[Through 52, White got the four corners, the key for the game is how Black can profit while attacking White's weak stones in the center.];B[hg]C[B53 is the most fierce attack.]
;W[kj];B[kl];W[kf];B[je];W[jf];B[fr];W[eb];B[lh]C[B61 is a move that worths more study.];W[ij];B[dg]C[B63 "invest" first, and it takes a big risk.];W[cg];B[gj]
;W[mj];B[nh];W[oj];B[lk];W[lj];B[nk];W[mk];B[ml];W[ok];B[nj]C[B75 quits attacking White, instead try to get some territory.];W[ni];B[nl];W[mh]C[Through W78, it looks like White can fight. It's time for 1 hour lunch break, each side has 5 hours in the game, O Meien has 1 hour and 59 left, Cho Chikun has 31 minutes left.]
