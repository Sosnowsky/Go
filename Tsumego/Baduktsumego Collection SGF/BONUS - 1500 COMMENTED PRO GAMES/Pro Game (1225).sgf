;W[qd];B[gm]LB[oe:a][pf:b][od:c][pg:d]C[If B73 captures at 'a' in a ladder, after W 'b', B 'c' and White's extension at 'd', Black can not look after two sides.];W[fm];B[hl]LB[hm:a][oe:b]C[B75 aims to lead the ladder at 'b', if White cuts at 'a', B 'b' will capture White in the ladder.];W[pf]C[The counter-attack of W76 has foiled Black's plan.];B[hm]
