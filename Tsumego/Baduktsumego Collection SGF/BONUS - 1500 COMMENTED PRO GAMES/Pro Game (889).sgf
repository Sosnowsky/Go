;W[jp];B[lq];W[dj]C[But W6 and W8 put emphasis on speed, not tangling with Black, perhaps this is Gu Li's strategy from his recent study.];B[fc];W[df];B[db];W[nc]LB[pf:a]C[After White approaches with W12, normally Black should answer at 'a'.];B[cc];W[qf];B[nd];W[md]
;B[ne];W[pc];B[oc];W[ob];B[od];W[mb];B[qc];W[pb]C[In the game, Black takes tenuki, White gets to double approach with W14, Black incurs loss.];B[qj];W[lo]C[W26 is an excellent point. Because Black is all in a low position, Black must invade into White's moyo.];B[fq];W[eq]
;B[fp];W[dn];B[jq];W[iq];B[ip];W[kq];B[jr];W[jo]C[W32, W34 and W36 are right moves.];B[hp]LB[ir:a][pg:b][kr:c]C[B37: Black usually will turn and atari at 'a', this way White takes sente and pulls out at around 'b'. In the game Black stresses on the pincer at 'c', White most likely will strengthen.]
;W[kr];B[ir];W[lr];B[qe]C[Black gets back and makes the diagonal bump with B41, the game enters into a steady situation.];W[er]LB[cq:a][gr:b]C[The descent of W42 is huge, to prevent Black from entering the corner at 'a' and also aim to jump in at 'b', Black is not alive.];B[mq]LB[nq:a]C[B43: Black pulls out one stone, attacking in order to defend, but it is indeed not a good move, this move induces White's tesuji at 'a'.];W[nq];B[mr];W[np]
;B[no];W[hr]C[W48 is an asking move.];B[gr]LB[hq:a]C[B49: Black can only take at 'a', but from state of mind, Black is really painful.];W[nr]C[White blocks with W50, White becomes very thick, Black's opening is not successful.];B[oq];W[or];B[mp];W[mo];B[pr];W[lp];B[os]
;W[ms];B[ch];W[ck]LB[cl:a]C[When Black invades with B59, the diagonal of W60 is a calm and good move, Black is insipid. With B59 Black should invade at 'a' instead, this is just the right direction.];B[eh];W[fd];B[gc];W[gd];B[hd]LB[gh:a]C[Next the hane of B65 is heavy, Black probably can only jump out at 'a'.];W[he];B[ie]
;W[hf];B[fi];W[hi];B[id]C[The connection of B71 is not highly efficient.];W[fg];B[ek]C[The knight's move of B73 is a product under an unfavorable situation.];W[ej]C[With the push and cut of W74, White is not soft-hearted.];B[fj];W[fk];B[hj];W[ii];B[el]

;B[cq];W[bn];B[bf];W[be];B[ce];W[cf];B[bd];W[bg];B[ae];W[cg];B[bq]LB[br:a]C[Through B103, it forms an exchange, due to the existence of ko tactic with the clamp at 'a', Black incurs loss.];W[nn]
;B[ap];W[qn];B[dl]LB[oi:a][ao:b]C[B107 is the last losing move! Black certainly should strengthen at around at 'a', this way when White initiates the ko at 'b', White is still very hard to control.];W[pg]C[In the game, White gets out with the diagonal of W108, destroying Black's territory and also attacking Black as well, Black is already in a losing trend.];B[qh];W[re];B[rd];W[pe];B[qd];W[ph]

;W[kc];B[lc];W[mc];B[kb];W[lb];B[jb];W[qb];B[rb];W[qa];B[on]LB[bh:a]C[With the unusual sequence following B137, Black again incurs loss. Now Black probably can only play at 'a' in order to have a chance to win.];W[oo];B[pn]
;W[po];B[qo];W[om];B[rn];W[pm];B[rm];W[bj]C[In the game, W146 is a declaration of victory, so far, Lee Changho has no state of mind to continue the game and concedes defeat.];B[bo];W[ec];B[eb];W[pp];B[qq];W[ql]
