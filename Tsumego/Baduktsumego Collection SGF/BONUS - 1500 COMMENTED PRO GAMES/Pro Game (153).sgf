;B[fd];W[fe];B[ge];W[hd];B[ee];W[df]LB[ff:a]C[W30: White can't retreat at 'a', otherwise after Black blocks at 36, although White can connect back his six stones easily, but Black at the top can easily make life, White's loss will outweigh his gain, so it is necessary for White to seek exchange.];B[ff];W[ce];B[ga]LB[bd:a]C[B39: Black can consider to turn at 'a', the play in the game appears a little crude.];W[ea]
;B[be];W[bf];B[ad];W[cg];B[jb];W[kb];B[ie]C[The strike of B47 is inevitable, if this is omitted, White can stick his head out here, Black is no good.];W[id];B[ka]C[Through B49, it seems both sides can fight.];W[lc];B[he];W[cm]
;B[kf]C[In terms of outcome, Black's attack with B51 and B53 seems to have accomplished nothing.];W[og];B[pg];W[oh];B[fq]C[After B55 and B57, then Black approaches the corner, it is somewhat questionable, because B57 doesn't affect White at all.];W[lh]C[After White strengthens with W58, White's situation is relatively optimistic.];B[cq];W[dq];B[cp];W[do];B[dr];W[er]
;B[cr];W[eq];B[bn]C[Black lives the corner with the sequence from B59 to B67, Black seems slow, perhaps Black wants to keep balance in territory. So far, it seems White is a little favorable and easier to play.];W[cn];B[bm];W[bl];B[co];W[dl];B[ck];W[am];B[bo];W[cl];B[fi]C[B77 is a good move.]
;W[jh]LB[jq:a]C[Black takes advantage in the exchange of B77 and W78, with B79 if Black makes the extension at around 'a', it will be a long game.];B[ci]C[In the game, B79 is very intense, in this area White has many choices.];W[eg];B[dh];W[gh];B[fh];W[fg];B[gg];W[hg];B[gf];W[bi]C[The situation up to W88 is very complicated, both sides are not easy to take control, the key is to see what strong moves Black can play.

After this move, it is time for noon break.

Black has used 1 hour and 3 minutes.
White has used 1 hour and 44 minutes.]

(;B[ih]C[B89: Lee Sedol elects to play the strongest and most unyielding attachment.

After the game, Gu Li found at this point Black actually has an amazing killing sequence, which is one way street for both sides, it leads to a ko fight, since Black has more ko threats, White would be forced into dire straits (see var a).];W[gi];B[gj];W[ii];B[ig];W[hi];B[ji];W[jj];B[ki];W[kh];B[kj];W[hk]C[The sequence up to W100 is inevitable from both sides.]
;B[jk]LB[bh:a][ch:b][bj:c][di:d][dj:e]C[B101 is a big bad move! If Black plays hane at 'a', next W 'b', B 'c', W 'd' and B 'e', initiating the ko, Black can fight adequately. Black can find ko threats by threatening White's big group on the right side.];W[fj]C[B101 leads to White's good move of W102.];B[ej];W[bj]C[This outcome equals to that White has saved one move, W104 eliminates the hidden trouble.];B[gl];W[hl];B[hm]

;B[hf];W[jf];B[je]LB[jn:a]C[After B121, Black already has no time to make the extension at 'a'.];W[jg];B[le];W[hg]C[W124 taking three key stones is very big, White is very happy.];B[mg]LB[md:a]C[B125: Black should make the diagonal extension at 'a'.];W[pf]LB[io:a]C[W126 is a good move, now White's advantage is already obvious.
