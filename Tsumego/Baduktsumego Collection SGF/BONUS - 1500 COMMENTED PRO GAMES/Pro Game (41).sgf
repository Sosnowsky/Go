;B[ce];W[ed]LB[dh:a]C[W6 is a steady move, to pincer at around 'a' is also possible.];B[ic]LB[ci:a]C[B7 is strong and unyielding, Cho Hunhyun's play is always full of attack characteristic, to make the three-space extension at 'a' is a mild play.];W[cn];B[dl]C[The high pincer of B9 is popular recently.];W[en];B[fp];W[bp];B[cq]

;B[ph];W[ps]C[Overall, Black's opening is not bad, but the play of B71 is questionable, making White enclose a big territory at the top, the exchange in the left side with B111 and B113 makes the game close, but in the critical moment under time pressure, B157 is not good, finally White luckily won the game by 1.5 points.
