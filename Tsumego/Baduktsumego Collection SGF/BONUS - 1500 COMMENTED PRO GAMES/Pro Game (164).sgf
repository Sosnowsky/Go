A move at 'a' is the safest but not efficient; If playing as in the game, later on after Black checks at 'b', White is hard to make life on the spot, so W18 at 'c' may be the proper choice.]

(;W[fj];B[gj];W[gk]TR[dk]LB[di:a][el:b][fl:c][cl:d][bl:e][en:f][em:g][dm:h]C[W22 and W24: It is distressing to sacrifice the marked white stone. In the postgame analysis, Nie 9p said White should consider to pull out at 'a', the purpose is not only to move out the marked stone and also to aim at the all-dominating ko with sequence of W 'b', B 'c', W 'e', B 'e', W 'f', B 'g' and W 'h'.];B[fl];W[df]

(;B[be]LB[ch:a][bg:b][de:c][ef:d][cd:e][ee:f][ce:g][gi:h][dh:i]C[The diagonal extension of B29 is a calm and good move. If Black plays as the joseki at 'a', then W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 'e', W 'f' and B 'g', because White's atari at 'h' is sente, White can cut and atari at 'i' to capture Black's key stones.];W[ce];B[bf];W[bd];B[cc]LB[cd:a][ef:b][de:c][ch:d][eg:e][dh:f][bc:g]C[The strike of B33 makes White suffering. If White connects at 'a', then B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e' and B 'f' (see var a). In the future, Black can clamp at 'g', there will have an opportunity for Black to take advantage of.]

(;W[bc];B[ch];W[eg];B[dh];W[ff];B[fi];W[qo]LB[mq:a][nc:b]C[The approaching move of W40 is not good. White should extend to 'a', allowing Black to protect the corner with B 40, then White can approach at 'b', this way White can form the upper and lower two moyos.];B[lq];W[nq]LB[jo:a]C[W42: White is overzealous. by checking with B41, Black wants to make trouble inside White's territory, W42 is a giveaway. Now White should calmly play at 'a' to fix his own defect first.]

(;B[kq]LB[ip:a][fq:b][er:c]C[B55 is a bad move and has ruined all the good aji of B53. At this juncture, Black should simple extend at 'a' to form a proper shape. Next even if White ataris at 'b', Black can stand at 'c', White would get nothing.];W[mo];B[jp];W[hr]LB[on:a][fr:b][io:c][dp:d]C[W58 is the losing move!  White certainly should seal off Black at 'a'. Hu Yaoyu is very regretful about this move, he thought he could take advantage in sente, then start the capturing race with Black in the lower right corner. However, why not first take advantage by playing at 'a'?  If White captures Black at 'a', Black has to kill all white stones at 'b', but now White has the good move of jumping at 'c', Black can not fence White in. If Black can only capture the small corner at 'd', then White's advantage in the game would be too big.];B[on];W[ip]
