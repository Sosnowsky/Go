Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[In the quarter final of Fujitsu Cup, all three Chinese players lost their games, it is a little surprising, of course all opponents are very strong, this possibility exists objectively.];W[pp];B[dd];W[dp];B[kc]

;B[fi];W[ke]LB[cc:a]C[W20: White can also enter the corner at 'a', watching how Black to enclose territory.];B[pg];W[qh];B[kg];W[me];B[mc];W[nd];B[nc];W[ng]C[Through W28, White is not bad.];B[dj]
;W[cc];B[cq]C[B29 and B31: Black tries to open up the situation.];W[dq];B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[eq];B[cp];W[co];B[fr];W[es];B[fp];W[eo]
;B[bp];W[gn];B[ip]C[The sequence from W32 to B45 are roughly acceptable from both sides.];W[ej]C[White counterattacks with the attachment and cut of W46, the situation becomes chaotic.];B[ek];W[fj];B[fk];W[gj];B[gk];W[ei];B[cl]LB[br:a]C[However, White should probe White at 'a' before B53. Black's sequence from B47 to B53 shows Lee Sedol's strength.]
;W[in]C[White's lonely group at the bottom comes under attack and White has to jump out with W54.];B[hj];W[hi];B[ii]C[Black takes control of the center with B55 and B57.];W[hk]C[With the cut and atari of W58, White also takes the lower side into account.];B[ij];W[hl];B[em];W[en];B[ch];W[dg];B[di]
;W[eh];B[hh]C[After the sente moves of B63 and B65, B67 is a must.];W[br]LB[bm:a][bk:b][bo:c]C[After the attachment of W68, now for Black to make the diagonal at 'a' is a good move. Because of White's tactic at 'b', White can't tight liberties at 'c'.];B[bm];W[an];B[ap];W[bn];B[ar];W[bk]
;B[bj];W[ck];B[bl];W[al];B[dk];W[am]LB[dl:a]C[W80 taking is a mistake, White should cut at 'a', this way White takes a little advantage in both eye shape and endgame.];B[cj];W[ak];B[bg];W[bf];B[gl];W[hm]
;B[dm];W[ge];B[hc];W[id]C[W88 and W90 are good moves!];B[he]LB[ic:a][gd:b][gb:c][gc:d][eb:e][fc:f][jd:g]C[B91 stressing on the center is Lee Sedol's bold style. If Black blocks at 'a' normally, White will push at 'b', Black is painful; If Black blocks at 'd', then White will be very happy to make the knight's move at 'e'; If White retreats at 'f', then White's extension at 'g' becomes sente. This is the reason why Black counterattacks with B91.];W[gd]
;B[hd];W[gc];B[gf]LB[gb:a][pm:b]C[B95: Black wants to take advantage in sente, the original move is to hane at 'a' and sacrifice two stones, next Black attaches in at 'b', tangling with two white groups by using thickness, Black takes initiative in the game.];W[hb]C[White's counterattack of W96 is inevitable.];B[ff];W[ic];B[fc];W[fb];B[eb];W[lb]LB[kb:a][kd:b]C[W102 is a mistake. White should attach at 'a', next B102 and W 'b', this is normal. In the real game, it forms an exchange, White incurs loss and Black is favorable.]

;W[oe];B[dc];W[cb];B[pe];W[qf]LB[re:a]C[W120 is slow! White should make the knight's move at 'a'.];B[qq]LB[mn:a]C[But B121 is wrong judgement, Black should stick his head out at 'a', this way White's big dragon is under attack, White dare not initiate the ko in the upper right corner, White also can't enclose such a big territory on the side, Black would be favorable.];W[pq];B[pr];W[qp];B[rr]
;W[rq];B[qr];W[pd];B[re];W[od];B[rc];W[lp];B[lq];W[np];B[oq];W[lk]C[White gets to enclose a big territory with W136, the situation has been turned around.];B[op]C[Black incurs loss again following B137, White originally can win the game by a small margin, however White makes mistake in the endgame.]
