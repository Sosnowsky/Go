In the second round, he defeated So Yokoku 7p of Japan by only half point, this shows that good luck is still with him in this event. Although the biggest obstacle Lee Changho was already eliminated from this tournament by Kong Jie, but the road to the champion is still beset with difficulties];W[dp]

;B[db];W[eb];B[cb];W[ec];B[cf]C[The opening up to the jump of B35 is the same as the game between Chang Hao and Wang Lei 8p in Nong Shim Cup preliminary this year, although he lost that game, but as to this opening, he must have better understanding.];W[ch];B[df];W[ef];B[eg];W[ff];B[cn];W[cl];B[fp]
;W[co]C[With the hit of W44, White not allows Black to take the corner territory easily, it leads to a fierce fight.];B[dn];W[eo];B[do];W[ep];B[cp];W[cq];B[bo];W[bp];B[cj];W[dg];B[bf];W[dk]
;B[dj];W[ej];B[ei];W[ek];B[fi];W[di];B[bq];W[co];B[ci];W[dh]C[The connection of W66 is not good. The opinion from all of us is that White should eliminate the ko, this way White is a little favorable for the game.];B[bh];W[eh];B[cp]

;B[fq]C[In the game, an exchange has resulted, the descent of B88 is a good point. Black takes the initiative.];W[en];B[em]C[With the hane of B85, the fight continues. Black doesn't want to give the opponent any chance to take a break.];W[gn];B[gm]C[When Black attaches out with B87, we all feel that the fight is to Black's advantage. However, White's resistance in the game is also very tenacious.];W[gj];B[hm];W[hn];B[in];W[io];B[fm];W[ho]C[With the connection of W94, although the shape is a little ugly, but Black also doesn't have any proper tactic to attack.]

;W[jp];B[ip];W[hp];B[iq];W[hq];B[jq];W[hr];B[kp]LB[dr:a][im:b][dm:c][fn:d]C[B115: Black can also consider to make the knight's move at 'a', next W 'b', B115, W 'c' and B 'd', Black can reduce White's liberties. This way Black's points would be clearly better than the real game, but White's outside will become thicker, it is hard to judge which variation is better.];W[dr]
;B[cr];W[dq]C[White gains a considerable profit by taking two black stones, Black is not leading in territory any more.];B[jc];W[ig];B[gf]LB[ih:a][kf:b]C[With the attachment of B121, Black wants to obtain sente in a hurry, if Black simply connects at 'a', White will attack with the knight's move at 'b', Black would sink into a bitter battle.];W[ge];B[hf];W[he];B[je];W[if]

;W[ll];B[ml];W[lj];B[mj];W[nl]C[The atari of W144 is a surprising move! However White can only fight like this in order to have a chance to win.];B[lk];W[bi];B[bj];W[mk];B[fn]LB[mm:a]C[After the push of B149, White has used all his reserved time. If White eliminates the ko at 'a', it would lead to a huge exchange, however this way it would be White's small defeat for the game.];W[fo]

;W[cm];B[bm];W[mk];B[cs]C[B161 and B167 are big damaging move, but Black ensures the advantage of one ko threat in order to win the huge ko fight in the center.];W[es];B[lk];W[an];B[bn];W[mk];B[fs];W[bs];B[lk];W[mm]C[White has no choice but to elect retreat with W176, however the situation is still not clear.]

;W[og]TR[qe]LB[mc:a][pf:b]C[W190, to save five white stones, is the losing move! White can only make the knight's move at 'a' to capture three black stones, then Black attaches at 'b', it leads to an exchange, this way it would be a close game with Black having a slight advantage. ];B[lc]C[After Black jumps over with B191, the outcome of the game already has no suspense. Black's ten-point lead already can't be altered. Chang Hao advances to the final for the second time.];W[mc];B[rm];W[rn];B[mb];W[md];B[nc];W[kb]
