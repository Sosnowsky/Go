;B[op]C[Black's opening is often played by Lee Changho, only Ma 9p changes a little bit, Ma first approaches with B5 and then protects the corner with B7.];W[iq];B[kq];W[qj];B[qh];W[qm];B[pl];W[ql];B[pj];W[pk];B[ok];W[qk];B[pi]
;W[ol];B[nk];W[jc]LB[om:a]C[W22 making a big-point extension is correct, now for White to strengthen at 'a' is not only slow, the exchange of W8 and B9 also appears damaging.];B[om];W[ro];B[rp];W[nl];B[pm];W[rh];B[rg];W[ri];B[fo]LB[ml:a]C[B31: If I were Black, I still wants to capture two stones in a ladder by playing at 'a'.]
;W[ml]TR[iq]LB[mq:a]C[In the game, W32 extending out two stones is still very big. Although Black captures the marked white stone(W8), but White is still left with the aji of invading at 'a'.];B[ko];W[mk];B[ni];W[mi];B[mh];W[li];B[in];W[lh];B[mg];W[lg]
;B[cf];W[be];B[ke]LB[mf:a]C[B45 not allowing White to connect and form thickness is good feeling. If Black extends at 'a' casually, White can connect together with the knight's move at 45, Black is not good.];W[mf];B[ld];W[hd];B[fd]C[The invasion of B49 is strong and tough! It is perhaps to Gu Li's surprise.];W[hf];B[ff];W[bf]LB[df:a][dg:b][if:c]C[The play of W50 and W52 appears weak, not like Gu Li's usual style, with W50 White wants to attach out at 'a', next B51 and W 'b', if Black seals off by jumping at 50, White can attach out at 'c' and fight with Black.]
;B[og];W[qf]
(;B[lf]LB[kg:a][oe:b][qg:c][qe:d][rf:e][fh:f]C[B55 is a bad move! Black overly puts emphasis on the good shape with the tiger's move at 'a', and overlooks the severeness of White's knight's move at 'b'. With B55 Black should make the diagonal at 'b', if White still cuts at 'c', then B 'd', W 'e' and B 'f', Black is not bad (see var a).];W[qg];B[qe];W[rf];B[kg];W[ii];B[fh]
;W[oe]TR[mf]LB[ne:a]C[W62 is sharp! If Black wants to capture the marked white stone, Black can only attach at 'a', this is not Black's original plan.];B[pe];W[me];B[pf];W[nc]C[But in the real game, White extends with W64 and flies down with W66, Black is being separated into two groups, Black is on verge of collapse.];B[kc];W[pb];B[mc];W[mb];B[oc]
;W[md];B[lc];W[nb];B[jb];W[qc]LB[ob:a][jd:b][le:c][ib:d][ic:e]C[W76: White has missed a good chance! To connect at 'a' is just the vital point! One of Black's two groups probably will die! If Black makes the diagonal at 76, next W 'b', B 'c' and W 'd', it leads to a capturing race and Black's liberty is not enough. If Black strengthens the left at 'e', White then can make the diagonal at 76, Black's big group is not alive.];B[ob];W[oa];B[rd]

;B[la];W[na];B[pg]C[B95 is a big mistake!];W[qd]LB[nj:a][nh:b][ng:c][oh:d]C[But since White didn't grab the chance with W96, instead Black is able to reinforce at 'a' to make life, Black instead takes advantage. With W96 if White ataris at 'b', next B 'c' and W 'd', Black's big group will die immediately! The game will be over. Gu Li unexpectedly didn't see this simple tactic, so it seems Gu Li was indeed not in state.];B[nj];W[no];B[oo]C[The exchange of W98 and B99 is clearly damaging and should be reserved.];W[ic]LB[jf:a]C[The retreat of W100 is the last losing move! White can only strengthen the cut at 'a'.]
;B[ie];W[he];B[ig];W[hg];B[ih];W[hh];B[hi]C[In the game, Black jumps to 103, bumps and cuts with B105 and B107, one of White's two groups will die for sure.];W[ji];B[ib];W[hb];B[gc];W[hc];B[gb]
