;B[pl];W[pe];B[qe];W[pf];B[qg];W[pm]C[After White presses with W20 and W22, White attaches with W24, aiming for efficiency and making Black over-concentrated on the right side.];B[om];W[pn];B[ol];W[qf];B[rf];W[rg]C[The push and cut of W28 and W30 are planned moves.]
;B[rh];W[pg];B[sg]LB[qh:a][re:b][qc:c]C[B33: If Black connects at 'a', White will atari at 'b', then hit at 'c' to take advantage. In fact, this variation is also playable for Black.

In the game, Black is not willing to fall behind, the situation becomes intense.];W[qh];B[qi];W[rg];B[fq];W[fc]LB[cn:a][qg:b][ph:c]C[W38: If White makes the small knight's move at 'a', Black takes at 'b' and White connects at 'c', this way both sides are steady, and the situation is even.]
;B[fb];W[ri]LB[re:a]C[W40: If White plays atari at 'a', both sides' burden is relatively lighter, it will become another game.];B[qg];W[gb];B[ph];W[eb]C[White initiates the ko resolutely with W40, it is a decisive move, but here White's judgement is a little problematic, Black's taking one stone is clearly bigger than Black's obtained profit in the upper left corner with W42 and W44.];B[be];W[bf];B[ad]C[Black takes one stone with B45 and B47, since White still has cut points and is not thick, Black is leading for the game very early on.];W[dn];B[rp]C[B49 exploiting White is severe.]
;W[ql];B[ro];W[rn];B[oo];W[on];B[nn];W[qp];B[qq];W[qj];B[pj]LB[no:a][rk:b][ip:c]C[B59 is a little conservative, Black should connect at 'a' (next Black can strike at 'b', White needs to strengthen in gote), next Black can connect together at 'c', Black's efficiency is adequate.]
;W[pk];B[ok];W[qk];B[oj];W[so]LB[rm:a][no:b]C[The hane of W64 is to guard against Black's clamp at 'a'. So far, since Black has the cut point at 'b' and can't be satisfied.];B[ld];W[lf];B[me];W[mf];B[nf];W[pd]
;B[ng];W[qc];B[de]LB[je:a]C[B73: For Black to make the knight's move at 'a' is a little better.];W[je]LB[nd:a]C[W74 is alert, forcing Black to reinforce at 'a', White obtains some profit.];B[cf];W[jc];B[ke];W[kf];B[nd];W[no]
;B[pp];W[rq];B[rr];W[sp];B[mq];W[eq];B[gd]LB[fp:a]C[B87: If Black extends up at 'a', Black is easy to keep the lead, however in the real game, B87 initiating a fight more fits fast game style.];W[ef];B[ie]C[B89 is tesuji, White is a little difficult.];W[kd];B[id]
;W[df];B[le]LB[jd:a]C[B93: Black doesn't elect to squeeze at 'a', it can be only explained as that Black has favorable consciousness.];W[fp];B[ce];W[ff];B[ch]LB[jd:a]C[B97: But Black doesn't play the vital point at 'a', it is really inexplicable.];W[dg];B[bg];W[bh];B[af]
;W[ei];B[bi];W[jd]C[After White connects with W104, the situation is already unclear.];B[nb];W[rc]C[Black shouldn't exchange B105 and W106, this is territory-damaging.];B[hb]LB[jf:a][if:b][jg:c][ic:d]C[B107: Black can only cut at 'a', if White plays atari at 'b', after B 'c' and W 'd', White can capture four stones, but Black's potential in the center is also very big.];W[fa];B[if]C[B107 and B109: Black is too hasty, it is the beginning to Black's defeat.]
;W[jf];B[ig];W[ki];B[ii];W[mh];B[nh];W[kk];B[ik];W[km]C[After White sticks the head out with W112, W116 and W118, White takes the chance to reduce Black's potential, the situation already has been turned around.];B[ej];W[ib];B[fi]LB[ha:a]C[B121: Black should block crossover at 'a'.]
;W[ha];B[jq]LB[cq:a]C[B123: Black should strike at 'a' to probe White, in the real game Black handles too simply, White is very easy.];W[gq];B[bn];W[bp];B[cl];W[eh];B[fk];W[mn];B[np];W[nm];B[sd]
;W[rd];B[re];W[ob];B[hr];W[hq];B[ir];W[gr]C[W138 and W140 are very thick moves.];B[co];W[el];B[fl];W[em];B[dk];W[sr]
;B[rs];W[dh];B[ci];W[si];B[gg];W[ni];B[oi];W[kp];B[jp];W[lq]C[W154 and W156 are clever endgames. The game is already decided, Black can't give komi.];B[lr];W[mp];B[nr]
