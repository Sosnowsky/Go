;W[od];B[oe]LB[cf:a]C[The attachment of B7 is often seen recently, in the past Black normally will play the double approach at 'a'.];W[ne];B[pe];W[nf];B[nd]C[B11: Black cuts and captures one stone, Black's corner is big.];W[md];B[nc];W[mc];B[ob];W[nb]
;B[oc];W[hc];B[cn]C[The corner-approach of B19 has the meaning of serving as the ladder breaker.];W[dl];B[me]LB[en:a][fp:b][bp:c][cq:d][bl:e]C[B21: However, Black can also elect not to cut right away but jump to 'a' instead, followed by W 'b', B 'c', W 'd' and B 'e'. The play of B21 in the game fits Gu Li's style.];W[kd];B[le];W[mg]
;B[kf];W[kh];B[fe];W[he];B[df];W[db];B[fg]LB[ig:a][if:b]C[B31 is slow, after W 'a', three black stones get killed. Black should jump to 'a' to fight with White.];W[ig];B[en];W[fp];B[fl]C[Perhaps Gu Li feels that B33 and B35 are very severe, but he didn't expect he would incur a strong resistance from White.]
;W[ej];B[gj];W[fm];B[em];W[el]LB[dh:a][bf:b]C[The crosscut with W38 and W40 are sharp, general feeling is to make the knight's move at 'a', but after Black jumps to 'b', White is hard to look after both the corner and the side.];B[gl];W[gm];B[hm];W[fo];B[cp];W[do]
;B[cl];W[ck];B[bm];W[cq];B[bk];W[cj];B[bj];W[ci];B[fi];W[cg]C[W56 was played after a long consideration, in the study room Rin Kaiho 9p, Chen Zude 9p and Hua Xueming 7p have calculated several times, if White's big dragon and Black's big dragon were involved in a capturing race, Black's situation is not optimistic, Black most likely will get killed due to one liberty short. As for the following sequence, this is also where Kato Masao is circumspect and far-seeing experienced and astute at, this move shows that Kato has already calculated the variation that both Black and White can live.];B[cf];W[bo]LB[bf:a][be:b]C[W58: White fails to conduct an exchange first, this almost leads to a disaster! White should first exchange W 'a' and B 'b', then play W58, this way Black can't kill White.]
;B[co];W[bp];B[bq];W[br];B[dn];W[fn];B[bi];W[bh];B[ai]LB[bf:a][al:b][bl:c][bn:d][dh:e][ch:f][ah:g]C[B67: In the game Black has missed a good opportunity of winning the game at one stroke! Black should descend at 'a' to kill White by one liberty! Next if White 'b', then B 'c', W 'd', B 'e', W 'f' and B 'f', White doesn't have enough liberties; Moreover if White plays the hane at 67, then B 'd', White still lacks one liberty. By Gu Li's calculation ability, he shouldn't have missed such a good chance. Perhaps this is such an important game, he didn't expect he could win the game that easily!]
;W[bf];B[ce];W[bd]C[After White crosses over with W68 and W70, Black's situation is already not optimistic.];B[ic]C[The attachment of B71 is a reserved maneuver earlier on.];W[id];B[jc];W[ke];B[hb];W[qo];B[og];W[mh]C[The exchange of B77 and W78 is not good, after it, all aji here seems to have disappeared.
];B[ql]
;W[mq];B[op];W[rq];B[jp];W[ko]LB[qr:a]C[The diagonal push of W84 is unnecessary, to make the diagonal extension at 'a' is simple and clear.];B[rr];W[qq];B[qr];W[or]LB[pm:a][oo:b][no:c]C[The exchange of W88 and B89 should be reserved, White should simply make the knight's move at 'a', this way White can attach at 'b', when B 'c', White's squeezing move at the star point would be absolutely sente.]
;B[pr];W[pm];B[pl];W[om];B[qm];W[pn]C[W94: With this inefficient shape, White is always not comfortable.
];B[no];W[kp];B[mn];W[ol];B[kq]C[With the sequence after B99, Gu Li played very tenaciously, the situation becomes a little complicated.];W[lq]

;W[nr];B[ms]LB[oq:a]C[The throw-in of B141 is the last losing move! Black should reduce liberty at 'a', although White will initiate a ko at 141, but Black is favorable in ko threats, so Black has nothing to worry.];W[oq]LB[be:a]C[After W142, it is still a ko, but after the ko becomes heavy for Black, the push at 'a' is not a ko threat any more.];B[po];W[np]LB[qn:a][qj:b]C[And the exchange of B143 and W 'a' is also very damaging, White can jump to 'b' to capture four black stones unconditionally.
];B[on];W[qn]
;B[pk]LB[nl:a][qj:b][mp:c][bn:d][am:e][be:f]C[B147: Black has lost his senses! Because W 'a' is absolutely sente, if playing here, Black should jump to 'b', but this way the situation is still not to Black's advantage.

Note: The opinion from the study room is, Black should take the ko at 'c', then W 'd', B 'e', W102 and B 'f', this way Black not only has more ko threats, but also White can't kill Black unconditionally at the bottom, Black is clearly favorable.];W[nl];B[pj];W[km]C[In the game, after the cut of W150, Black has already collapsed.];B[im];W[mm]LB[nn:a][lm:b][mp:c][bn:d][nq:e][al:f][oi:g]C[After W152, if Black connects at 'a', then W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 'e', W 'f', B144 and W 'g', this way Black's territory would be inadequate.]
;B[be];W[lm]LB[mp:a][nn:b]C[After W154, if B 'a', then W 'b', this is a double-ko, Black will die unconditionally, White wins for sure.];B[bc];W[cd];B[ad];W[dg];B[af];W[bn];B[am];W[eg];B[bg]
