Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[This is the game 10 of the 1st Kangwon-Land Cup ring contest between Chang Hao 9p and Lee Changho 9p.];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[fc]
;W[cf];B[kc];W[po]C[The one-space high approach of W8 is often used by Lee Changho 9p recently.];B[qm];W[qq];B[qp];W[pp];B[qo];W[qn];B[pn];W[rn];B[rq];W[qr]
;B[ro];W[oq];B[rm];W[on];B[pm]C[Through B23, they have played a very ancient joseki in the lower right corner.];W[od];B[pf];W[of];B[og];W[qc];B[rc];W[rd]C[White's sequence from W24 to W30 is a tactic to dodge and becomes popular recently.]
;B[pc]LB[qe:a][rb:b]C[B31: For Black to retreat at 'a' is the steadiest move, but White can capture one stone in the corner at 'b' and obtain the corner territory in sente. Lee Changho perhaps is not happy with this result. In the real game, B31 is the strongest answer.];W[qe];B[qb];W[pd]C[After the two ataris of W32 and W34, it forms a complicated "ko-fighting" situation.];B[nf];W[qc];B[de];W[ee];B[qd];W[rp]
;B[sp];W[qc];B[dc]C[With B37 and B43, it seems Black wants to win the ko fight in the upper-right corner even if playing some damaging ko threats.];W[ec];B[qd];W[eb];B[fq]LB[qc:a][ed:b][cc:c]C[But B47 breaks away from the main battle field, it is really inexplicable. Based on the current situation, with B47 Black should connect at 'a', otherwise when B45, Black will play atari at 46, next W 'b' and B 'c' ......, this variation is much better than the real game.];W[dn];B[mq]
;W[no];B[kp];W[qc];B[cl];W[qd]C[After White eliminates the ko with W54, Black's loss in the top two corners is not tolerable, and Black also didn't gain any clear profit in other places. Therefore, White already establishes superiority.];B[nb];W[rh]LB[rf:a]C[W56 is a must, if Black jumps down at 'a', White's eye shape will be threatened.];B[el];W[cm];B[bk];W[ch]LB[cd:a][ed:b][ce:c][df:d][bf:e]C[The one-space extension of W60 is very big, to guard against Black's tactic of living the corner with B 'a', W 'b', B 'c', W 'd' and B 'e'.]
;B[eo];W[en];B[bm]C[B61 and B63 are good moves to settle the shape.];W[fo];B[bn];W[gq];B[gr];W[gp];B[hq];W[jp];B[er];W[ko]C[W70 and B72 are thick moves.]
;B[jq];W[kq];B[lp];W[iq];B[jr];W[hp];B[hr];W[lo]C[Through W80, White's play is very simple and clear.];B[ir];W[ip];B[bg];W[df];B[bh]
;W[ic]C[B83 and W86 are miai good points.];B[fd];W[ed];B[ie];W[jd];B[jf];W[kd];B[lc];W[ld];B[nd]LB[rb:a]C[W96: If Black connects at 'a', Black perhaps still can fight.];W[oc]
;B[nc];W[ob];B[oe]C[The sequence from B95 to B99 is almost dame play, it is very difficult to believe these moves were played by Lee Changho.];W[me]C[After White takes chance to obtain territory with W96 and W98, and White again obtains the sente move of W100, White is very favorable. So far, Black already has no chance to win.];B[ne];W[mg];B[kg];W[lg]C[In the second half of the game, Chang Hao's play is a little conservative, but eventually White still wins by 3.5 points.];B[ki];W[mi]C[With less than 100 moves, the defeat was already decided, this is a game where Lee Changho loses grace.];B[fe]
