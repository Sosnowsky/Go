];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[fq]
;W[cn];B[jp];W[qn];B[qp];W[qk];B[qi]C[The opening from B1 to B11 is Yu Bin's favorite.];W[on];B[pm]LB[pn:a][mp:b][qm:c]C[B13 is an asking move, if White connects at 'a', then Black will reinforce at 'b', Black can take tenuki in the game when White answers at 'c'.];W[qm]
;B[fc];W[hc];B[cc]LB[pn:a]C[B17 is a steady move, directly pushing and cutting at 'a' is also playable.];W[dc];B[cd];W[de];B[db];W[eb];B[cb];W[ec];B[cf];W[qf]LB[pf:a]C[When White invades with W26, Black is reluctant to press at 'a', Black's strategy is to take territory first.]
;B[nc];W[qc]C[W28 directly entering the corner is really unexpected! But leading to a fierce fight is to Lee Sedol's likes.];B[qd];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[qe];W[ob];B[nb];W[oc];B[od];W[nd];B[lc]
;W[md];B[oa];W[pc]C[The sequence up to W42 seems inevitable.]
(;B[pf]LB[pa:a][rf:b][pg:c][sf:d]C[B43: For Black to extend at 'a' to kill the corner is also possible. Next White must clamp at 'b', then B43, W 'c' and B 'd', Black can fight (see var a).];W[pa];B[ld];W[mf];B[lf];W[pg];B[og];W[le];B[ke]
;W[me];B[jd];W[kf];B[ph];W[lg]C[With the sequence from B45 to W56, Black's one stone in the center is captured, Black has failed in the attack.];B[ie];W[jb];B[jf];W[kc];B[kd];W[mc];B[kb];W[mb]
;B[ib];W[hb];B[jc];W[fd]C[However, both sides are safe up to W68, Black still has sente, so the outcome of the game is still not clear.];B[mp]LB[pl:a]C[B69 is slow! Black should extend at 'a' to probe White and then decide how to strengthen himself.];W[hq]C[The invasion of W70 is sharp! Black has no way to retreat.];B[hp];W[iq];B[ip];W[kq]C[Next the jump of W74 is a good move.]

;W[gs];B[er];W[dr];B[ep];W[dq]C[White has succeeded with the variation up to W92.];B[pl]C[Now B93 is already one step slow.];W[qo]C[With the hit of W94, White has no problem to make life.];B[pk];W[qj];B[pj];W[ri];B[rh]
;W[rp];B[rq];W[sp]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.];B[op];W[sq];B[rr];W[rj]LB[qg:a]C[With the sequence from W100 to W106, White makes life steadily, and White is also left with the aji of connecting at 'a', Lee Sedol's situation judgement is very optimistic.];B[fr];W[gr]LB[eo:a][lr:b]C[W108 is a slow move, now White should play the atari at 'a', Black can't kill White, later on White can play at 'b' to resist strongly.]
;B[ls]C[After B109, White is already not that optimistic.];W[ch];B[cg];W[dh];B[eo]LB[en:a]C[B113 is a crude move! Black certainly should jump to 'a' instead, this way White definitely can't enclose a big territory at the top.];W[en];B[fn];W[em];B[do];W[co];B[fm]

;B[hl];W[hn]C[The ensuing fight is chaotic, what is worth mentioning is that the diagonal's extension of W134 is a good move!];B[ek];W[el];B[jl];W[fo];B[go];W[gn];B[dj];W[cj];B[ck];W[dl];B[ci]

;W[eh];B[gd];W[gc];B[fe];W[fb];B[ii];W[ji]LB[im:a]C[W176: White should peep at 'a', after the exchange, this peep is already gone, from the result, this is the root cause of White's defeat in this game.];B[hi];W[ig];B[gi];W[hf];B[pn]
;W[lk];B[li];W[mi];B[mh];W[lj];B[ni];W[mj];B[lh];W[jj];B[ij];W[jh]C[When White connects safely with W192, White's advantage should be very clear, but next White makes several mistakes, exhibiting a level of performance that is below the standard.];B[jg];W[ih]
;B[ml];W[nj]LB[sh:a]C[First, W196 is a mistake, moreover, White has many chances to play the hane at 'a', don't know why Lee Sedol always turns a blind eye to this.];B[ll];W[ng];B[nf];W[nh];B[mg];W[oi];B[oh];W[ni];B[kg];W[po]
