As a result, in a win or die situation, the defending champion Kobayashi Koichi played brilliantly, took White and defeated Yoda Norimoto by 4.5 points, changing the score to 1:2.];W[dd];B[pq];W[dq];B[do]
;W[co];B[dn];W[cp]LB[cn:a][dp:b]C[W8: White intentionally avoids the once popular "large avalanche" joseki, if White crawls at 'a', Black will bump at 'b', returning to the joseki.];B[pk];W[jp];B[fc];W[cf];B[jd];W[qf];B[pf]LB[qe:a][nd:b][qi:c]C[B15: In the past, as to the approach of W14, Black will always make the diagonal's extension at 'a', then W15, B 'b' and W 'c'. Because the marked black stone is in a high position, after being checked by White at 'c', Black is not comfortable, so now Black instead will press from the top.]TR[pk]
;W[pg];B[qe];W[of];B[pe];W[og];B[nd];W[qi]LB[rf:a][qh:b][qg:c][rh:d][qo:e][pi:f]C[W22 is a very interesting play. If White descends at 'a' instead, then B 'b', W 'c' and B 'd', White seems cumbersome; If White directly approaches the corner at 'e', Black will definitely tenuki to attack White at 'f', so White first probes Black with W22, then decides what to do next.]
;B[qg]LB[rf:a]C[B23: Black elects to take territory first, otherwise if White descends at 'a', White would get eye shape and also be left with the follow-up tactic of obtaining the corner.];W[rf];B[rg];W[qh];B[re];W[qo];B[rk]LB[ql:a][oi:b][np:c]TR[qo]C[B29: For Black to jump on the second line is a little painful. If Black blocks White's crossover at 'a', White will jump to 'b', Black can do nothing to the marked white stone; If Black defends the corner at 'c', White would connect at 29, Black still doesn't have any good follow-up.]

(;W[le]LB[oq:a][jh:b][oj:c][pj:d][ni:e][nj:f][mj:g][mi:h][nk:i][nh:j][je:k][oh:l]C[W34 is over lukewarm, now White certainly should grab the enticing big point at 'a'. The best Black can manage to do next is trying to kill White at 'b', but now White can attach at 'c', B 'd', W 'e', then B 'f', W 'g', B 'h', W 'i' and B 'j'. In this variation, White already has gained a big profit at 'a', and takes advantage again by making a ponnuki in the center, White only needs to attach at 'k', effectively utilizing the ko fight at 'l', it is impossible for Black to kill White as a whole (see var a).];B[pp]
;W[po];B[oo];W[ql];B[qk];W[oq];B[or]LB[rp:a][ro:b][pr:c]C[B41: Black should jump at 'a', if White blocks at 'b', Black will take advantage in sente then hane at 41 and connect at 'c'.

After this move, it is time for noon break.];W[nr];B[pr];W[nq];B[on]

;B[sq];W[sp];B[sm];W[sn];B[mf];W[mg]LB[me:a][lf:b][kf:c]C[W64: White can only attach here. If White pushes at 'a', then Black will counter-push at 'b', then W 'c' and Black can turn at 64 to fight tenaciously.];B[lf];W[kf];B[me];W[kg]
;B[rs];W[lp]LB[lq:a][kp:b]C[W70: White can only reinforce this way, otherwise Black would invade at 'a', if White caps at 70, Black can wedge at 'b', White would instantly have no answer.];B[ke];W[nl];B[pm]LB[ni:a]C[The exchange of W72 and B73 is damaging to White, reducing one of his own liberties. Besides, this move has no big support to the fight in the center, White should directly attach out at 'a'.];W[ni]
(;B[nj]LB[mj:a][nh:b][mh:c][mi:d][mk:e]TR[nl]C[B75: For Black to hane from the outside is not good. After being separated into two groups by White at 'a', Black's outside are all white stones, Black is clearly not favorable in the fight. Black first should hane at 'b', W 'c', then Black ataris at 75, W 'd' and B 'e', sealing off White (see var a). Only if there is no fight in the outside, the marked white stone must be a damaging move.];W[mj];B[mi];W[nh];B[oj];W[lj];B[ki]

;B[hc]LB[fe:a][os:b]C[B95 is too weak! Black certainly should jump to 'a' to attack White! Now for Black to capture at 'b' is a big point worth 30 points, Black definitely needs to obtain sente by attacking, while making himself thick in the center and taking territory as well.];W[gd];B[eb];W[hj];B[hk];W[ij];B[ik];W[os]
(;B[gj]TR[ii]LB[gi:a][fj:b][hi:c][hh:d][ih:e][jj:f][ji:g][gk:h][cn:i][di:j][eq:k]C[B103 is the losing move. Hu Yaoyu 7p thinks, Black should play at 'a', followed by W103, B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f', W 'g', B 'h', the marked white, B 'i', W 'j' and B 'k'. This kind of wrapping up is very happy and Black also would have ruined White's territory at the bottom, it is simple and Black is favorable (see var a).
];W[jj]
;B[kj];W[hi]LB[fp:a];B[lk]C[B107: Black has missed a good opportunity, White not only has escaped with W104 and W106 in sente and also created eye shapes. What the most important is, Black ends in gote, after White encloses the side territory at 'a', Black instead will suffer a big defeat due to lack of territory.]LB[fp:a];W[fp];B[ci];W[je];B[kd];W[fn];B[go];W[fo]
