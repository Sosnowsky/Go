The players are chosen among recent national champions and top 8 overall ranking pros. To expand Weiqi's influence among universities, the sponsor arranged the final to take place in Beijing University. The final was played between Yu Bin 9p and Chang Hao 9p.];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp]
;B[fq]C[Because this is a fast game with 30 seconds per move and each player has only 10 times 1 minute freely controlled time, so players would not use any of those free time in the opening.];W[cn];B[fc];W[hc];B[pk]C[B9 following B5 and B7 approaching the corner forms Chinese Fuseki, it's a positive play.];W[kc]C[The play of W10 is played frequently, it aims to slow down the pace and prepares for a protracted war.];B[jp];W[po]C[W12 approaching the corner is #1 choice at this time, especially when White has two-space extension of W10.];B[qp];W[op];B[mp]C[As for the modern Chinese Fuseki, B13 and B15 are the most severe attack maneuver against corner approach.]
;W[oq];B[qo];W[pm];B[qn];W[mo]C[The attachment of W20 is a positive play.];B[lp];W[mm]LB[pn:a]C[White thought W22 would guard against the push and cut at 'a', actually W22 is the losing move for the game, White has underestimated the severeness of push and cut.];B[pn];W[on];B[om];W[ol]
;B[nm];W[nl];B[nn];W[no]C[Originally trying to avoid fierce fight, now Yu Bin 9p has no way to back down, W30 setting up a ko fight is the only way to proceed.];B[oo];W[ko];B[mn];W[lo];B[kp];W[on];B[ln];W[km];B[oo]

;W[jm];B[go];W[fo];B[gn];W[hm];B[do];W[en];B[gm];W[hl];B[co]C[B101 pulling out inevitably results in a ko fight, this instead gives a chance for the opponent. By winning the ko fight Black can kill 15 white stones, then this Black's big group has more than 85 points. White has more than 30 points locally and has a chance to seal off Black.];W[ds];B[cq];W[er]
;B[im];W[fs];B[hn];W[jo];B[io];W[fl]LB[fk:a]C[How to seal off Black with 100 is worth study, how about at 'a'? it is very hard decision to make at this 30-second-per-move fast game. ];B[gl];W[fj];B[gk];W[gi];B[hi];W[hh]
;B[fk];W[ek];B[ej];W[hj];B[gj];W[fi];B[hi];W[cc]LB[dk:a]C[Whether W124 should stand at 'a' to secure the left side is also hard to fathom within 30 seconds.];B[dk]C[Through B125 to 135, Black is very content with making this group alive, Black's territory on the board is close to 100 points.];W[el];B[ei]

;B[nd]C[B141 can not be omitted, otherwise if White hanes here, the gap in the game will be very small.];W[qf]C[From 142 to 201, both sides try to kill the opponent's dragon, in the end White could not kill Black and has to concede defeat.];B[pf];W[qg];B[nc];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[qe];W[ob];B[pg];W[ph]
