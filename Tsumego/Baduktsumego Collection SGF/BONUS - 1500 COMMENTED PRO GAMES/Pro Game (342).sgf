;B[de]LB[ep:a]C[B5: Normally Black will approach at 'a'.];W[dg]C[The tight pincer of W6 is popular nowadays.];B[ep]C[B7 taking tenuki is relatively rare.];W[fd]C[W8: White has many choices, the play in the game is very positive.];B[fe];W[gd];B[cc];W[cb];B[dn]C[B13: Black takes tenuki again, both sides try to take initiative.];W[eq]
;B[fq];W[dq];B[fp];W[cd]LB[bn:a]C[W18: Normally White will make the knight's move at 'a', but at this situation, its value is not big.];B[fg]C[B19 is a related move to the configuration of the lower left corner.];W[bf]LB[ce:a]C[The knight of W20 is better than crossing over at 'a'.];B[ei]C[B21: Black proceeds with his original plan. So far, it forms a situation of Black's outside influence vs. White's territory.];W[nq];B[lq]LB[lp:a]C[B23: For Black to play high pincer at 'a' is also possible.]
;W[lp]C[W24 is a proper choice.];B[kq];W[no];B[pn];W[kp];B[jp];W[jq];B[jo]LB[iq:a][jr:b][ir:c][ip:d]C[The counterattack of B31 is inevitable, if Black plays atari at 'a', next W 'b', B 'c', W31 and B 'd', Black's shape will be over-concentrated.];W[kn]
;B[jr];W[iq];B[ir];W[nm];B[qk]LB[jn:a]C[Black can be satisfied with the exchange of W36 and B37, so it seems with W36 for White to press at 'a' is more powerful.];W[nc]C[After this move, the game was closed for the first day.];B[bo];W[bp];B[pf];W[pb];B[mp]
;W[mo];B[jn];W[km];B[jm];W[kk];B[lc]C[Black's play from B43 to B49 makes White uncomfortable.];W[ne];B[qc]C[B51 is a mutual good point.];W[jc];B[le];W[ng];B[ph]TR[lc][le]C[Through B55, Black is leading in territory, how White to attack Black's two marked stones is the key for the game.]
;W[hf]C[W56: White uses a loose-attacking strategy.];B[jb]C[B57: Black seeks to make life.];W[ib];B[kb];W[kd]LB[ic:a]C[W60 aims to guard against Black's strike at 'a' in sente.];B[nb]C[B61 is a good move.];W[od];B[mc];W[ob];B[ma]C[Through B65, Black can be satisfied.]
;W[ci]C[W66 itself is very big and also White aims to attack Black's four stones in the upper left corner.];B[ke];W[qb]C[The play of W68 is worth study.];B[qq]LB[np:a]C[The value of B69 is not small, it prevents White from striking the corner, and Black is also left with the push at 'a'.];W[jl]LB[fh:a]C[W70 is to prepare for the crosscut at 'a'.];B[eg]C[B71 is a thick move.];W[hl];B[rc]C[B73 is kind of sente.]
;W[ni];B[np]C[B75 is an early leftover tactic.];W[hq];B[hr];W[op];B[mq];W[pm]C[W80 is an asking move.];B[pj]LB[qm:a][po:b][qn:c][qj:d]C[B81 is a steady move in a favorable situation, if Black plays hane at 'a', White may have many tactics such as wedging at 'b', cutting at 'c' or attaching at 'd', Black has no assurance of success.]
;W[dk]C[W82: White starts to attack Black, since Black at the top is still not alive yet, Black also has some apprehensions.];B[hh];W[ih];B[ig]C[B85: Black aims to fix the shape in sente.];W[hg];B[hi];W[fj];B[fi];W[jg];B[je];W[if];B[ch]
;W[ic];B[md];W[pe]LB[ja:a]C[W96 is a good move to obtain sente, White is left with the hane at 'a' to fight desperately with Black later on.];B[qe];W[cg];B[ej];W[ek];B[cj];W[dj];B[di];W[bi];B[fk]
;W[fl];B[gj];W[gk];B[gm]LB[do:a]C[B109: Black kind of guards against White's diagonal cut at 'a'.];W[fj];B[hk];W[ik];B[hj];W[bh]LB[gl:a][bj:b][dh:c]C[W114 is a good move, if White connects at 'a', then B114, W 'b' and B 'c', White is not good.]
;B[gl];W[fk];B[hm];W[il];B[fm];W[cl];B[gh]C[Through B121, White gains a big profit by attacking.];W[im];B[in];W[me];B[ld];W[oe];B[pc]
;W[oc];B[jd];W[qn];B[oo]C[After White grabs the big endgame with W130, Black's situation is already not optimistic.];W[rl];B[rk];W[dh];B[eh];W[co]C[White is very happy with the sente push and atari of W136.];B[cn];W[bn];B[bm]
;W[ao];B[cm];W[rp];B[rq];W[ok]C[The seal-off of W144 is not small.];B[oj];W[nj];B[pl];W[on];B[po];W[ql];B[ol];W[om]
