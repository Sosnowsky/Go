Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[This is one of Korean league games between Cho Hunhyun 9p and Lee Sedol 9p. With regard to the defeat in this game, Lee Sedol must feel very painful, since he established a big advantage very early in the game, but he played so many slow moves and eventually lost the game by only a small margin.];W[dc];B[pp];W[dp];B[de]
;W[ce];B[cf];W[cd];B[fq];W[cn];B[dg];W[fc];B[ck];W[dr];B[jq];W[qn];B[pn]LB[ql:a]C[B17 is rarely seen in recent years, for Black to play at 'a' is rather common and generally better.]
;W[pm];B[qo];W[on];B[po];W[rn];B[om];W[pl];B[ol];W[ok];B[nn];W[ro];B[qq];W[nk]C[Through W30, White's shape is good.]
;B[qh]LB[qg:a]C[B31: The original move is to make extension at 'a', the play in the real game is to seek high efficiency, this is Cho's style.];W[qj];B[oc];W[qf]LB[kp:a]C[W34 is to give tit for tat, in fact, to play at 'a' will make Black more worried.];B[rj];W[rk];B[pj]C[B35 and B37 are good tesujis! To borrow strength is the key to dodge.];W[qi];B[pi]
;W[ri];B[qg];W[pf];B[oh]LB[og:a][pk:b][of:c]C[B43 is too heavy, Black should play at 'a', next W 'b' and B 'c', Black's shape is more complete.];W[pk];B[nf];W[rg];B[ko];W[hq];B[fo]
;W[fr];B[hc];W[ng]C[W52 is severe! Next Black is being separated and can only run out on his own, White takes the initiative.];B[og];W[of];B[mg];W[ne];B[nh];W[od];B[nc];W[me];B[ld];W[kf]
;B[rh]LB[re:a]C[B63 is too unreasonable! Now Black should escape, there is no time to play here, Black should play at 'a'.];W[pc];B[pd];W[qc];B[re];W[rf];B[rc];W[kd];B[le];W[lf];B[lc];W[rb]
;B[sb];W[lh]C[After W76, Black sinks into a bitter battle.];B[mj];W[kj];B[lk];W[jl];B[kk];W[jk];B[jj];W[ki];B[ij]LB[lm:a]C[B85 perhaps is miscalculation, Black can only play at 'a', this is better, although Black's situation is not favorable.]
;W[ni]LB[lm:a]C[W86 is a good move! If Black wants the tail, White can kill all Black at 'a'. In the real game, White captures Black's big group on the right side, White is clearly favorable.];B[mi];W[mh];B[jh];W[oi];B[gr];W[gq];B[er];W[eq]C[W94 is Lee Sedol's style, not giving an inch easily.];B[fs];W[fp]
;B[cq];W[dq]C[W98: Why not take the ko?];B[gp];W[fr];B[qk];W[ql];B[fq];W[ep];B[hp];W[fr];B[dd];W[ed];B[fq]
;W[ee];B[df];W[fr];B[cc];W[bc];B[fq];W[bf];B[bg];W[fr];B[cb];W[bb];B[fq];W[mm]
;B[kl];W[fr];B[iq];W[mn];B[fq];W[km]LB[jn:a]C[W128 is a damaging ko threat! If White wants to give up ko fight as in the real game, this move and W 'a' should be reserved.];B[jm];W[fr];B[db];W[ec];B[fq];W[pb]
;B[qa];W[fr];B[gb];W[eb];B[fq];W[jn];B[im];W[fr];B[fa];W[ea];B[fq];W[ke]LB[hr:a][jc:b][bl:c]C[W146 is really inexplicable! In the real game, B 'a' is sente, it means White loses the ko fight unconditionally! However with W146 White loses the variation at 'b', W146 itself also is a bad move, White should answer at 'c' and continue the ko fight, this way Black is not good. In the game, the difference between them has been reduced dramatically.]
;B[hr];W[cr];B[kc];W[mp];B[nq];W[dl];B[cl];W[cm];B[dk];W[np];B[mq];W[el];B[ek]
;W[jc];B[jb];W[jd];B[ic];W[kb];B[lb];W[fl];B[lp];W[kn];B[be];W[bd];B[af];W[rq]C[W172 is a good move! White takes endgame advantage by favorable ko threats.]
;B[rr];W[sr];B[rp];W[sp];B[sq];W[ib];B[ka];W[rq];B[nd];W[oe];B[sq];W[md];B[oa]C[B185: Black should connect, in the real game, although White has less ko threats, but Black incurs one-point loss.]
;W[rq];B[qr];W[kh];B[sq];W[mk];B[lj];W[rq];B[bm];W[bn];B[sq];W[mc];B[mb];W[rq]
;B[al];W[qp];B[op];W[ei]C[W202 is a good move!];B[eh];W[fh];B[fi];W[fj];B[gi];W[ej]C[Through W208, White obtains profit.];B[ci];W[hi]LB[lo:a]C[But next W210 is not careful and precise! White should squeeze at 'a', this is the biggest endgame, this way White will win small.]
;B[hj];W[gj];B[gh];W[hh];B[gg];W[hg];B[hf];W[ig];B[in]LB[lo:a][jo:b]C[In the real game, White pounds on Black around, Black turns with B219, and finds 'a' and 'b' become miai, in this war White incurs a loss of 2+ point.];W[lo];B[en]

;W[an];B[dj];W[am];B[bl]C[When Black plays B251, Lee Sedol suddenly concedes defeat?! Although White indeed may lose this game, but you have to say he has such a special character! Because if the game continues till the end, White also may lose only by half point.])
