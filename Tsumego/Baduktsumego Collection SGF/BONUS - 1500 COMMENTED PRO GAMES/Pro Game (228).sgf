Translation:GoGameWorld.];B[qd]C[The game 1 of the 58th Japanese Honinbo final was held in Korea on May 14th to May 15th, as a result Kato Masao 9p was proved to be still at the heights of his powers, as he took Black and defeated Cho U 8p with only 183 moves and had a good start in his defending battle.];W[dp];B[cd];W[nd];B[oe]
;W[fd];B[df];W[jc]C[After two high approaching moves of W4 and W6, the extension of W8 is seldom seen. Cho U probably strives for novel plays.];B[pp]C[B9: But Black can take the empty corner, it is a big move and Black can be satisfied.];W[qk];B[qm];W[qh];B[jq]LB[od:a][nc:b][oc:c][qf:d][qc:e][rc:f][pc:g][re:h][ql:i][qn:j]TR[qk]C[B13: For Black to attach at 'a' is also very big, then W 'b' and B 'c'. Kato elects to make the extension on the lower side while considering that even if W 'a', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f', W 'g' and B 'h', White takes the corner in sente, but after B 'h', the position of the marked white stone and W12 is not good; If the upper-right shape is settled this way, the marked white stone should be at 'i' or 'j' to move towards the lower right corner.]
;W[od];B[qf];W[qc];B[rc];W[pc];B[re];W[dj];B[hc]LB[oq:a][cc:b]C[B21 is a good move. The purpose of the invasion is not to ruin White's territory but to strengthen the upper-left corner in sente. If Black directly grabs the big point at 'a', then White would attack the upper-left corner at 'b', because both sides of the corner have white stones, Black would be clearly unfavorable in a direct confrontation.

After this move, it is time for lunch break.

;B[dc];W[hd];B[oq]C[After Black has cleverly sacrificed one stone, Black gets to grab the vital point of B27, there is no question that Black's opening is successful.];W[fq]LB[cn:a][bo:b]C[W28: White maybe should enclose the corner at 'a'. In the game, although White has expanded his moyo with W28, but B 'b' makes White very painful.];B[ol];W[oi];B[bo];W[bp]LB[cp:a][cl:b][bq:c][br:d]TR[dj]C[W32: If White answers at 'a', then Black would make the extension at 'b' to attack the marked white stone, later on Black can also crawl at 32, then W 'c', and B 'd', White would be no good.]

;W[en];B[fn]TR[dj]C[Through 47, although White has gained some territory, but after being haned at the head by B47, Black has not only destroyed White's side territory but also separated the marked white stone, Black's advantage is obvious.];W[jo];B[dm];W[eo];B[ko];W[kn];B[kp]LB[gp:a]TR[dj][jo]C[However, B51 and B53 are too conservative. Kato perhaps feels that his advantage is very big, so he elects to make the game simpler and steadier. Black can also consider to separate White at 'a', then the two marked white stone and White's right group all have to escape from death, Black can take advantage by attacking.]
;W[dg];B[cg];W[ch];B[bg];W[ln]C[W58 is the vital point, after this move, Black can only enclose three lines of territory on the lower side.];B[im];W[eg];B[jn];W[nk];B[ef];W[fg];B[ge]C[After this move, the game was closed for the first day. Kato has used 3 hours and 42 minutes, Cho U 3 hours and 18 minutes.]

;B[ig];W[hh];B[fb]C[After White has strengthened the center, B93 is the biggest move on the board, White's territory instead is a little inferior.];W[rg];B[jj]C[After this move, it is time for lunch break. Kato has used 3 hours and 20 minutes and Cho U 2 hours and 45 minutes.];W[ik];B[jk];W[lj];B[fk];W[fj];B[gj];W[gi]
;B[rn]LB[ph:a][pi:b]C[B103 is a wrong sequence play. Black should first attach and exchange B 'a' and W 'b', making sure Black's upper-right corner is alive, then initiate the ko.

White should calmly connect at 'a', then B 'b' would not become a sente move any more, Black's corner would be very dangerous.];B[ng]LB[of:a][mf:b][me:c]C[After Black attaches with B123 and connects at 'a', White can not strike at 'b' due to the push of B 'c', so White can no longer kill Black cleanly.]
