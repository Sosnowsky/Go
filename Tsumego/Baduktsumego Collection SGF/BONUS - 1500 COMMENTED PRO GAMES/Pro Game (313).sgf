;B[pf];W[hd];B[fe];W[hf];B[db];W[cc];B[hb]C[The opening up to B25 is exactly same as the game between Chang Hao and Won SeongJin in LG Cup, however Won SeongJin is Black in that game.];W[je]LB[ke:a][ic:b]C[W26 is a good move, Chang Hao played at 'a' and Black answers at 'b'. The position of W26 is better than that of 'a'.];B[ic]LB[fg:a]C[However B27 is no good, Black certainly should stick his head out at 'a', in the game White seals off Black and is successful in the opening.]
;W[fg];B[qm];W[rd];B[pe];W[re];B[rg];W[rf];B[do];W[gq]LB[dm:a]C[W36: White always wants to attack with the pincer at 'a', this way White is initiative.];B[fp];W[co]C[W38 is a novel play, I think this is probably the reason why White doesn't elect to pincer-attack.]
;B[cn];W[cp];B[dm]LB[gg:a][fq:b]C[B41 should be reserved, Black should attach out directly by playing at 'a', see how the game proceeds, then decide whether to hang at 41 or block at 'b'.];W[fq];B[dp];W[cq];B[gg];W[gf];B[ff];W[eg];B[gh]
;W[ih];B[gj];W[dj];B[ik];W[kh];B[kf]C[B55 is fierce and relentless! Black can only attack White in the center in order to make up for territory inadequacy.];W[jf];B[kg];W[jg];B[ji];W[ke];B[mf];W[ii]
;B[ej]C[B63: Black has no choice but to protect the cut with sente this way.];W[ei];B[jj];W[fj];B[fi];W[ek];B[gk];W[ge];B[ed];W[ie]LB[jh:a]C[W72 is not that fierce and brutal, White should connect at 'a', Black perhaps has to kill White's dragon in order to win the game. Because Black in the center is not very thick, so White's big dragon basically can make life.];B[jh]TR[kh]C[After Black cuts the marked white stone with sente, the situation becomes close.]

;B[dn];W[pl];B[gp];W[hp];B[ho];W[io];B[hn];W[fl];B[fk];W[el];B[fn]LB[bk:a]C[B97 is too slow! Probably Hu Yaoyu thinks his situation is not bad, Black certainly should descend at 'a', if White separates Black, Black can make life locally.];W[nl]
;B[pm];W[om];B[bk]C[After B97, Black still need to descend at 101, the value of B97 is very small! Furthermore White obtains the precious sente, and gets to exploit Black's lower-right corner, White is already slightly favorable for the game.];W[qo];B[qp];W[rp];B[po];W[hc];B[gc];W[rn];B[ri];W[sg]
(;B[rq]LB[qn:a][ro:b][ql:c][pk:d][rk:e][rj:f]TR[ri]C[B111 is the losing move for the game, Black should atari at 'a', then W 'b', B 'c', W 'd' and B 'e', if White answers at 'f', then Black can hane to kill corner (see var a), if Black can connect back the marked stone and try to kill White's big dragon in the center (see var b)!];W[qq];B[rr];W[rl]C[After White connects back with W114, Black is already losing the game by a small margin.];B[bj];W[ch]

;W[qc];B[pc];W[qb];B[ej]LB[pb:a]TR[qm][pm][rm][qn]C[B157: However Black has lost the last change! Hu Yaoyu thinks this move must be sente! Black should block at 'a', it would be a half point game, this way at least Black still have a chance. In the game, because there are no enough ko threats, Black has to give up the marked four stones, the game is practically over.];W[pb];B[bn];W[bo];B[dk];W[fj]

;B[pd];W[ac];B[ef];W[bd];B[sr]C[Overall in the game, the situation is always very close, however in the middle-game fight, Hu Yaoyu is too optimistic and has played several slow moves. B111 is clearly too conservative, Black can counter-attack but elect to draw back.];W[sp]C[The game 10 between Won SeongJin and Ryu Shikun will take place on 11/17.])
