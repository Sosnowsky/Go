Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[In the round 11, two world champions Chang Hao 9p and Luo Xihe 9p together have played a brilliant game.];W[dd];B[pq];W[oc];B[dp]
;W[qo];B[fc]C[B7 is rare and never seen in big international tournaments.];W[id]C[The pincer-attack of W8 is a state of mind.];B[pf];W[qh]C[W10 is positive, here is just the weak point of B9.];B[pc];W[od];B[qg]C[B11 and B13 are typical crude moves, but Xihe plays freely and doesn't care at all.];W[ph];B[of]C[B15 is important, after sticking the head out, Black may do nothing on both sides.];W[ld]
;B[cc]C[B17: Black takes corner, in the opening Black already controls four corners, White can do nothing about it.];W[dc];B[cd];W[de];B[db];W[eb];B[cb];W[ec];B[cf];W[fq]LB[mp:a]C[W26 obviously can't be played, W 'a' is just the original move.];B[pl]C[B27 is alert! Black first acts in urgent places and takes the initiative.]
;W[op];B[oq];W[np];B[nq]LB[mq:a][qq:b][mp:c]C[B31 crawling one more is unnecessary, to directly play at 'a' is just fine, If White attaches at 'b', Black's press at 'c' is a very good move.];W[mp];B[lq];W[nl];B[ok];W[ni];B[pp]
;W[po];B[on]C[B39 is a good move!];W[om]LB[oo:a][nk:b]C[W40: If White tolerates at 'a', Black can press at 'b', but in the real game, Black drops a burden with the counterattack, Black can also fight.];B[pn];W[pm];B[qn];W[qm];B[ro];W[oo];B[nn]
;W[rm];B[rn];W[lp];B[qp];W[mq];B[mj];W[ll]C[B53: Black pulls out the lonely stone and doesn't want to leave anything behind!];B[oi];W[oh];B[nj];W[qk];B[ln];W[jp]
;B[lh];W[ob];B[rj]C[B63 is sharp! It is a typical tesuji of Luo's style.];W[rh]LB[qj:a]C[W64: White should tolerate at 'a', in the game, Black obtains eye shape in the center, White incurs loss.];B[qj];W[ng];B[pb];W[pj];B[pk];W[rk];B[pi]
;W[sj];B[mi];W[ri];B[nh];W[mg];B[lg];W[rf];B[re];W[fd];B[ip];W[iq];B[hq];W[ir]
;B[jo]LB[cn:a]C[B85: Black's fighting intention is too strong, Black can first prepare at 'a'.];W[hp]C[W86: White can only counterattack, a chaotic fight thus starts.];B[io];W[gp];B[kp];W[lr];B[kr];W[kq];B[jq];W[jr];B[lq]
;W[ks];B[kq];W[ko];B[jp];W[mr];B[hr];W[js];B[er];W[kn];B[lo];W[km];B[hn];W[gr]
;B[hl];W[gn];B[en];W[gl];B[hk];W[kj]C[W114: White must take profit in the center, otherwise Black got four corners, Black's territory is substantial.];B[ih];W[el];B[nm];W[ol];B[je];W[jd];B[cn]
;W[jh]LB[se:a]C[But the order of W122 is clearly wrong, White should first play hane at 'a'. In the game, Black captures four stones with B129, it is too big! The important thing is Black's corner is resilient and White can't kill cleanly.];B[ji];W[ki];B[jg];W[kh];B[kg];W[se];B[lk];W[mm];B[jl];W[rd];B[qe]
;W[rc];B[me];W[ne];B[rg];W[sg];B[nf];W[mf];B[le];W[og];B[md];W[mb];B[rb];W[sb]
;B[lb];W[kb];B[nb]C[B147 and B149 are good moves!];W[nc];B[mc];W[na];B[qa]C[After B153, since White can't tight liberties on the outside, Black takes tenuki again, White still can't kill Black!];W[oa];B[mn]C[B155 creates ko threats.];W[kl];B[kk];W[qc]C[W158: White starts the ko.]

;W[sd];B[sc];W[ps];B[ns];W[sb];B[nr];W[sc]LB[kc:a]C[Through W178, White captures Black's corner, but Black gains more profit in the center and the lower side, especially Black still has the tactic at 'a' at the top, White's situation has deteriorated.];B[ls];W[ms];B[hs];W[gs];B[mo]
