;B[kc];W[qn];B[ql]C[Through B9, the opening is Choi Cheolhan's favorite and the same as that in game 2.];W[on]C[W10: White seeks variation, if White attaches the corner, Black's configuration will be too good, White can't be satisfied. In this kind of international tournaments, to play novel moves need courage.];B[po];W[pn];B[ol];W[np];B[nr];W[mm];B[ml];W[ll]

;B[pf];W[hd]LB[ke:a]C[W46: For White to cap at 'a' is common, the play in the real game is very strong and unyielding, leading to a fierce fight.];B[fe];W[hf];B[kf];W[fg]C[Through W50, it seems White has more territory and can fight.];B[db];W[gc];B[cc];W[ec];B[fd]
;W[eb];B[fb];W[ea];B[ef];W[cd]C[Through W60, White again obtains one big corner, forcing Black to attack strongly.];B[eg]C[Through B61, it forms a complicated fight, the situation is difficult to judge.];W[gb];B[ie];W[jd];B[he];W[je];B[jf]
;W[if];B[id];W[ic];B[ge];W[jc];B[ld];W[fa];B[fi];W[mc];B[md];W[oc];B[nd];W[qc]
;B[rc];W[pd];B[qe];W[rb];B[qb];W[pb]LB[kb:a]C[After W76, White clearly gains and makes one worry-free ko unconditionally, this ko is very light to both sides, but even if White loses this ko fight, White is still left with the endgame at 'a' to take advantage.];B[pc];W[hk];B[hi];W[qc];B[bd];W[be]
;B[pc];W[rl];B[rm]C[Through B95, it seems White is not bad in territory, White is a little better.];W[qc];B[iq];W[qa];B[fq];W[lf]C[Through W100, the opinions from high hands in national team are, Luo Xihe (White) incurs a small loss in the fight following W46, but in the exchange of the upper-right corner, Luo Xihe gains some profit.];B[ke];W[pl];B[qk];W[oe]
;B[of];W[ne];B[nf];W[me];B[dn]C[Through B109, I think Black is a little easy to play.];W[lg];B[jh];W[nh];B[ph];W[cn];B[co];W[do];B[cm]
;W[bn];B[bo];W[bm];B[cq];W[dq];B[cr];W[cl];B[dm];W[dl];B[fm]C[In the lower-left fight, White is very dangerous, Black is thick outside.];W[dr];B[cp];W[fp]
;B[el];W[gq];B[cj];W[dj];B[bk];W[jr];B[gr];W[jq];B[ip];W[jo]C[Through W140, White is a little difficult in this situation, White has not much territory, in the upper-left corner, Black is left with ko-live tactic.];B[gp];W[go];B[io]
;W[hp];B[hq];W[ii];B[ih];W[jn];B[gp]LB[fn:a]C[B149 is a careless move and a major mistake, if Black doubles at 'a', White is fraught with grim possibilities.];W[gm]C[The attachment of W150 is a good move, closely grabbing Black's tight-liberty weakness. If White's big dragon doesn't die, White hopefully can win the game.];B[fn];W[fo];B[ek];W[gn]
;B[in];W[im];B[jm];W[gq];B[hm];W[il];B[gl];W[hl];B[gp];W[gk];B[ho];W[ej];B[dk]
;W[fk]LB[em:a]C[W168 is a careless move, White should throw in at 'a' first.];B[em]C[Black connects alertly with B169, whether White can make two eyes is not clear.];W[fl];B[hn];W[gi];B[gh];W[hj]C[Through B174, it is time for lunch break.];B[gj];W[fj];B[ei];W[di]
;B[ch];W[ji];B[jk];W[jl];B[kl];W[dh];B[dg];W[kh]LB[kk:a]C[Luo Xihe makes mistake again, with W186 White should cut at 'a', after White makes life his big dragon, the game will be turned around.];B[ki];W[kj];B[jj];W[ij]
;B[li];W[jg]C[Thorugh W192, White's big dragon is in dare straits.];B[hh];W[ci];B[bi];W[bh];B[cg];W[bl];B[ck];W[ai];B[bj];W[bg];B[an]
;W[kg];B[ig];W[kk];B[lj];W[ik];B[eo];W[eq];B[fr];W[eh];B[fh];W[kd];B[le];W[lc]
;B[gf];W[ee];B[hg];W[if];B[hf];W[nc];B[lk];W[od];B[jk];W[jj]C[Afterwards, Choi Cheolhan plays some questionable moves perhaps due to time pressure, Luo Xihe releases some desperate game-deciding moves of initiating ko, it forms three-ko rotation dramatically.];B[ds];W[if];B[jf]
;W[pk];B[pj];W[df];B[ff];W[kf];B[er];W[qj];B[qi];W[rj];B[pm];W[ed];B[ep];W[if]
;B[gl];W[gm];B[gn];W[jf];B[gl];W[gi];B[gm];W[gd];B[gj];W[oj]C[White takes a better turn, if both sides insist fighting the ko, it probably will lead to cyclic three-ko.];B[jk];W[pi]C[After the exchange, Luo Xihe's calculation is very clear, White is winning!]
