;B[cn];W[cp];B[cf];W[fc];B[dn];W[fq];B[dj]C[Yu Bin uses the opening from B5 to B13 quite often recently, he must have done his own research on this shape.];W[po];B[pm];W[no];B[nq]
(;W[qk]LB[qq:a][qr:b][qp:c][or:d][qm:e][ql:f]C[W18 is inappropriate, on the back of Black's left side, the fight would not be to White's advantage, White should attach at 'a', then B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e' and B 'f', White cuts, this variation is relatively better (see var a).];B[ol]TR[no][po]C[In the game, after the diagonal extension of B19, White already can bridge over, the marked two white stones appear heavy.];W[qf];B[pj];W[of]LB[nc:a][qj:b][qi:c][pf:d]C[The exchange of W22 with B 'a' is a little damaging, if White simply extends at 'b' and 'c', White is worried that Black may directly attach at 'd', this way Black would be very thick.]
;B[nc];W[qj];B[ph];W[qi];B[lm];W[lo];B[jn]LB[qm:a][qh:b]C[B27 and B29 are good feeling! However Black should first exchange B 'a' and W 'b'.];W[pi];B[oi];W[ok]LB[qm:a][qh:b]C[The attachment of W32 is severe! Black already doesn't have time to exchange B 'a' and W 'b'.]
;B[mn];W[mo]LB[pl:a][pk:b]C[The connection of W34 is completely inexplicable! White certainly should squeeze at 'a', this way Black would be very difficult. However in the game, due to the addition of B33, Black's push at 'b' becomes effective, the play of W32 instead becomes a bad move.];B[pk];W[oj];B[pl];W[mj]C[White jumps out with the sequence following W38, but the fight is clearly a little farfetched for White.];B[ni];W[mk];B[qh];W[rh]
;B[rg];W[si];B[on];W[lh];B[oo];W[ng];B[ql];W[qc]LB[rf:a][jq:b]C[W50: Usually White will simply strengthen at 'a'. In the game, White wants to obtain sente and grab the big point at 'a', it seems White's pace would be fast, but actually, White's three stones get captured, White's loss is still too big!];B[qd];W[pc];B[rc]
;W[rb];B[rd];W[rf];B[oc];W[jq];B[rk];W[rj];B[sl];W[lc]LB[sj:a]C[The original move of W62 is to reinforce at 'a', but White now is in an inferior position and already can't look after the big ko. As to Black, there is a "flying knife" left, Black is indeed very beneficial!];B[dp];W[cq];B[ef]

;B[go];W[kp];B[lq];W[jp];B[fo];W[il];B[gd]LB[jk:a][hj:b]C[B85: But Black breaks away from the main battle field! Now if Black immediately starts the ko, Black can destroy White at one stroke! Only if Black plays two moves at 'a' and 'b' consecutively, White's big group would have no way to escape!];W[fd];B[ge];W[qq];B[qr]
;W[ll];B[jk];W[mm];B[sj]LB[hj:a]C[Next Black makes another mistake. The timing of B93 to start the ko is not good, Black would be better if first flying back at 'a' and waiting for a good chance to initiate the ko.];W[sk];B[nm];W[rl];B[ml]LB[ln:a]C[Next, B97 still should be played at 'a', this way there would be no cut points.];W[hj];B[ij]
;W[op];B[pp];W[hi]LB[hk:a]C[With a series of exchanges, Black incurs a big loss! When White extends out with W102, Black dares not cut at 'a', too painful! So far, the situation already becomes not clear.];B[ii];W[hk];B[hh];W[np];B[oq];W[jr];B[hr];W[kl];B[jl]
;W[km];B[rm];W[ln];B[ih];W[qo];B[ro];W[qp]LB[sm:a]C[However, Song TaeKon makes several mistakes. W116 and W118 are hard to understand! Comparing with the single taking move at 'a', White suffers a loss equal to komi (6.5 points).];B[rp];W[fi];B[eh];W[ek];B[dk]

;B[cl];W[dm];B[bn];W[rq];B[qn];W[cm];B[bm];W[fg];B[ie];W[eg]LB[en:a][eo:b][fb:c]C[The pushes of W142 and W146 are very crude, even in overtime, you shouldn't have this kind of feeling! With W142, White should hang at 'a', then B 'b', White is already alive in sente, then blocks at 'c', this way the outcome of this game is still hard to imagine.]
;B[dg];W[je];B[eb];W[ff]LB[db:a]C[W150 again is a dame move, attaching at 'a' is clearly better.];B[cc];W[dc];B[cb];W[cd];B[jc];W[db];B[da];W[fb]
;B[fa];W[ba];B[if];W[ca];B[ea];W[bc]C[W160 and W164: White spends one extra move to get the corner territory.];B[aq]TR[jc][if]C[Black gets to grab two points B155 and B161 (the marked two stones), Black is leading about 15 points on the board, Black's victory already can't be changed.];W[ar];B[ap];W[br];B[jd]
