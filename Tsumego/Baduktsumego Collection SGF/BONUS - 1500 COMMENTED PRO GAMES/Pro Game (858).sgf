;W[qj];B[ql];W[qg];B[jq];W[qn]C[The invasion of W10 aims to strike the lower-right corner at 3-3.];B[pn];W[qq];B[pq];W[qp];B[po];W[rn];B[ph]LB[qh:a]C[When B17, White is certainly reluctant to answer at 'a'.]
;W[pm];B[pj];W[pl];B[pk];W[qk];B[qi];W[rl];B[rj];W[rk];B[nm]C[In the real game, it forms an exchange, the situation is even.];W[nl];B[mm];W[fq]
;B[fc];W[cf];B[jd];W[qe]LB[oe:a][ri:b]C[The play of W34 is to my surprise, I thought White will reduce at 'a'. In the real game, White takes some risk, since White can take one stone at 'b' at any time, so the right side is already not very big. However, it can't be denied White's play in the real game is also very powerful.];B[pd];W[rd];B[rc];W[pg];B[rh];W[ng];B[nj]
;W[ml];B[mh];W[mg];B[lg];W[lf];B[lh]LB[kg:a]C[B47 is a little slow, Black should extend at 'a', this way Black puts more pressure on White's big group.];W[me];B[kf];W[ke];B[je];W[jf];B[kg]
;W[kd];B[kc];W[lc];B[jc];W[mb];B[of]C[The timing of B59 is difficult to control, if played earlier, it may become a damaging move, but in the real game, White can also ignore it and turn the body around lightly.];W[nc]C[White's sequence following W60 is alert.];B[og];W[ob]C[Through W62, it again forms an exchange, the situation is still even.];B[lm]LB[bo:a][bp:b]C[B63 is slow! Black should play at 'a' or 'b' to take away White's corner and keep balance in territory.]
;W[od];B[pe];W[co]C[The value of W66 protecting the corner is huge! Now Black is thick on the board, Black should play more positively, the play in the real game looks slow.];B[db];W[fd];B[ec];W[dj];B[ed];W[ee];B[cq]C[B73 is an asking move.];W[dq];B[cl]
;W[cj]C[After the invasion of B75, White's sequence following W76 is almost inevitable.];B[ek];W[fi];B[gk]C[Through B79, it becomes a close game.];W[hq];B[bo];W[bp];B[bn];W[cn];B[bm];W[bq];B[bk]

;B[ce]C[B101 is my regrettable losing move!];W[cd];B[be];W[bd];B[bf];W[bg];B[cg];W[bh];B[df];W[dg]C[I had overlooked White's strong tactic from W102 to W110, Black's six stones are being captured by one liberty short, Black incurs a big loss! White becomes favorable.];B[hf];W[he]
;B[gd];W[hg];B[if];W[gh];B[cc];W[af];B[qr];W[rr];B[ip];W[dl]LB[hn:a]C[The crosscut of W122 is unnecessary, White should directly make the knight's move at 'a'.];B[hp]LB[hn:a]C[B123: Black fails to grab the chance, Black should play at 'a', this way Black perhaps still can fight.]
;W[hn];B[gn];W[go];B[gm];W[ho];B[gp];W[fp];B[dk];W[dm];B[ck]C[Through B133, both sides are safe, the situation is still slightly to White's advantage.];W[kn];B[gq];W[gr]
;B[hr];W[hs];B[ir];W[pr]C[The value of W140 is huge.];B[or];W[qs];B[lo]LB[nr:a]C[The aji of Black's big territory in the center is not good, B143 is to guard against White's tactics such as 'a', now on the board there is no other bigger place.];W[kb];B[jb];W[qb];B[rb]
;W[ja];B[ia];W[ka];B[ld];W[le];B[ne];W[nd];B[nf];W[ae];B[mf];W[md];B[ib]LB[fm:a]C[Before Black connects with B159, Black should first play at 'a' in sente, to guard against White's strike inside. Even if Black plays like this, Black's situation is still a little inferior.]
;W[fl]C[When White pounds at Black's big group with W160, Black's defeat is already unavoidable.];B[el];W[fm]C[The key for the game is the miscalculation of B101, which is too severe and decides the game.];B[ej];W[ln];B[mo];W[al];B[gj];W[ij];B[hm];W[gl];B[ik]
