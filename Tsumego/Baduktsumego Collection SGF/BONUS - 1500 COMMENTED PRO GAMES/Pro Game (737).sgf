];B[oo]LB[oq:a][pn:b]C[The knight's move of B7 belongs to "other category", it shows O Meien's style of not conforming to no conventional pattern. The most common move is to protect the corner at 'a' or make the knight at 'b'.
];W[pq];B[qq];W[no];B[nn];W[mn];B[nm];W[lo];B[fp]LB[dl:a][mm:b][nl:c]C[The sequence from W8 to W14 looks normal, but it is the root cause of White's defeat in this game. I think with W8 White can consider  to take tenuki and play two-space high pincer, or with W14 White continues to press at 'b', next B 'c' and W15, this is also one conception. Overall the knight's move of B15 is an excellent point, White can't miss it.
];W[qi]LB[fq:a]C[W16: White breaks up the situation and W16 also serves as ladder breaker after the attachment at 'a'.
];B[qk];W[qf];B[qe];W[pf];B[nd];W[fq];B[gp]C[However, as to Black, to retreat with B23 can also be very satisfied.];W[co];B[dp];W[cp]
;B[cq]C[The play of B25 and B27 is very simple and clear.];W[bq]LB[cn:a]C[W28: For White to extend at 'a' is better.];B[cr];W[br];B[eq];W[dr];B[er];W[cs];B[kq]C[Through B35, Black is already leading in the opening.

;W[mq]C[As to W46, following B47, Black obtains sente by sacrificing, it is a planned play, although Black incurs loss in territory, however White already spends two moves.];B[ph]C[B65: Black attacks three white stones, Black still keeps the initiative for the whole game.
];W[qh];B[nf];W[oj];B[nh];W[on];B[po];W[ol];B[nk]C[The jump of B73 is a good move!];W[ql];B[qj]
;W[pj];B[rl];W[og];B[jn];W[ko];B[oh];W[pi];B[rf]C[White almost connects back with dame moves and is very painful, Black takes chance to play the big hane of B83.
];W[nl];B[dm];W[kc]C[The invasion of W86 is the last game-deciding place.];B[jc]
;W[je];B[kd]LB[ie:a]C[B89: For Black to attach at 'a' is also possible.
];W[oc];B[nc];W[jd];B[ic];W[ld];B[ke];W[od];B[oe];W[pe];B[re]
;W[kf];B[qg];W[le];B[db]C[Following W90, O Meien shows a combination of brilliant tesuji. White captures B89 and B95 two stones, at the first glance Black may make mistake, the situation is about to be turned around, but Black wedges with B101 in sente and captures four white stones, then Black makes the knight's move of B103 into the corner. After a situational judgement, surprisingly Black still keeps the lead. Since most shapes are settled on the board, White's thickness of taking two stones can't be utilized, and White doesn't gain advantage in points. O Meien's unconventional play is really worth admiring.];W[cc];B[ch];W[ge];B[gd];W[dk];B[dj];W[cj];B[ck]LB[ek:a][fi:b]C[B109 and B111, to fight by sacrificing, is declaration of victory.

If playing more relentlessly, with B109, Black can jump to W110, next W111, B109, W 'a' and B 'b', this way Black takes more advantage in points.
];W[di];B[ej];W[ci];B[ei];W[dh];B[bk];W[hk];B[gl];W[rm]C[W120: White makes the last-ditch struggle, however it is obviously unreasonable.];B[pl];W[qm];B[pk];W[pm]
;B[ok];W[ml]LB[ps:a]C[W126: If White takes at 'a', Black will play atari at 126, even if White can capture Black, it is still not to White's advantage.
];B[qs];W[nj]C[W128: White wants to escape himself and also capture Black, it is indeed very difficult.];B[mk];W[mi];B[kk];W[mg];B[pg];W[jl];B[jk]C[However following B135, Black's play is steady, not giving White any chance.]

;B[fe];W[ed];B[gc];W[gi];B[mh];W[gk];B[fk];W[hi];B[kh]C[Through B157, Black captures several stones, White's defeat has already been decided.
