;B[dr]C[In my memory,  Chang Hao used the opening up to B7 many times in the past.];W[po];B[qo];W[qn]LB[pp:a]C[W10: White can also bump at 'a', which will lead to the large avalanche joseki, in comparison, the play in the game is relatively simple.];B[qp];W[qf]LB[pn:a][nq:b][pj:c]C[The purpose of W12 is obvious, if Black makes the small knight's move, then W 'a', B 'b' and W 'c', White forms an ideal shape.];B[qh]C[Black counterattacks with B13, not following your opponent's plan is a state of mind.]
;W[pn];B[qk]LB[nq:a][of:b][nc:c][pi:d]C[B15: Black is creative! Normally Black will jump to 'a' at the bottom, next W 'b', B 'c' and W 'd', Black can't be satisfied.];W[oq];B[or];W[pp];B[qq];W[nq];B[nr];W[lq]C[The set pattern from W16 to W22 is one-way street.]
;B[qc]TR[qf]LB[nc:a]C[The diagonal of B23 is seen very often in professional games, it is a positive play, the purpose is to force White to escape W12 (the marked white stone), then Black takes chance to take territory. Black's other choice is to make the small knight's move at 'a'.];W[of];B[mc];W[pj]LB[oh:a][ok:b][mk:c]C[W26: White's common play is to turn and cap at 'a', next B 'b' and W 'c', White has no assurance of success in this kind of attack. Here to seal off Black's two stones is the most ideal.];B[pk]LB[qj:a][ph:b]C[B27: If Black blocks at 'a', then W 'b'.]
;W[qj]C[W28: White has the state of mind to block down, it seems B27 is unreasonable.];B[oj];W[rk]
(;B[oh]TR[pk][qk][of][qf]LB[ok:a][oi:b][pi:c][qi:d][ph:e][rh:f]C[The jump of B31 is good feeling, treating lightly the two marked black stones B15 and B27 and putting pressure on the two marked white stones W12 and W24. If Black connects at 'a', then W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 'e' and W 'f', Black is painful (see var a).];W[ri]LB[mf:a]C[W32: The common play is for White to hang at the second line, Black blocks and White jumps to 'a'.];B[ok]
;W[ql];B[mg]C[B35: Black takes the whole situation into account, but the shape is a little bad.];W[ne];B[md];W[pi];B[og];W[lf]C[Before crossing over, with W36, W38 and W40 White wants to leave some threads of playing afterwards on Black's outside.];B[nf];W[oe];B[me];W[re]LB[mf:a]C[W44: White reserves the atari at 'a', tasteful.]
;B[fc]LB[mf:a]C[B45: If Black connects at 'a', White will protect the corner with the small knight's move.];W[mf];B[ng];W[kg]LB[cf:a]C[W46 and W48 are inevitable, who can obtain sente in the fight around here is very crucial, the double approach at 'a' in the upper left corner is a big point.];B[ki]LB[kh:a]C[B49 is the shape, better than attaching at 'a'.

];W[ig];B[ee]C[B51 is Choi Cheolhan's first-notch feeling, attacking posture. Today his state is not bad, my first feeling is to double approach, but Black's several stones in the center may come under attack.];W[cf]
;B[ii];W[id]C[W54 is a good move! With this move, White obtains a big territory, better than simply jumping out. Now both sides' strategies are very clear: Black hopes to take the initiative by attacking, White tries to handle his lonely stones and obtain territory as well, keeping balance in the situation.];B[dg];W[cg];B[dh];W[hh]LB[dc:a]C[W58: For White to descend at 'a' is also not a bad move.];B[hi]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.];W[fh];B[df];W[de];B[ff]
;W[ge];B[ed];W[dc]C[Through W66, both sides are roughly acceptable, White's corner is big, lonely stones basically have a living shape, White's tempo is not bad.];B[gh]LB[gi:a]C[B67: Normally Black will simply extend at 'a', in the game Black tries to eliminate White's eye shape, this subtle place also shows Choi Cheolhan's ferociousness and relentless.];W[gg];B[gi];W[fg];B[ch]LB[bh:a][be:b]C[B71 is the strongest move, to descend at 'a ' later on is sente, White probably has to answer at 'b'.];W[fi]LB[kd:a]C[W72: White is reluctant to make life by jumping to 'a'.]
;B[fj];W[ej];B[ei]C[B73 and B75 are the only moves, here both sides can't relax.];W[dj];B[bh];W[ji]
(;B[jh]LB[jj:a][kj:b][gj:c][fk:d][gk:e][fl:f][gl:g]C[If B79 at 'a', then W79, B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f' and W 'g', Black is dangerous (see var a).];W[gj];B[fk];W[gk];B[fl];W[jj]C[After White extends with W84, Black probably dare not save his four stones. W78 is a clever move.]
;B[kh]LB[ih:a][hg:b][jg:c]C[If B85 at 'a', then W85, B 'b' and W 'c', Black is no good.];W[ih];B[cl];W[kf]C[W88 is good shape, White obtains a big profit in this area, saving one move to make life and also making himself very thick.];B[kj];W[ij];B[be]LB[bd:a][mj:b]C[B91: Black wants to take advantage in sente, White can just answer one move at 'a', to make life is not a problem. Black still needs one more in the center, for White to strike at 'b' inside is very severe.]
;W[mk]C[W92: White takes tenuki, it is a kind of playing momentum.];B[lk];W[mi]C[After White jumps in with W94, the variations are a little complicated. Because there is a big move in the upper left corner, Black may turn his body around, White doesn't have certainty of success.];B[ml]LB[mj:a][nl:b][oi:c][ni:d][nj:e][mh:f]C[W96: White can only connect at 'a', followed by B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e' and B 'f', this way it will lead to a ko.];W[oi];B[mj]
;W[ni]C[W96 is a surprising move, with B99 if Black takes tenuki to capture the upper left corner, Chang Hao can only elects to kill, it seems he is confident.];B[bd];W[kl]C[W100: White starts to kill.];B[lm];W[km];B[ln];W[nm]C[W104 is a good move, Chang Hao's calculation is accurate.];B[nn];W[om];B[kn];W[ll]C[Through W108, White's profit is very big.]
;B[jk]C[B109 is a good move, this group is still not completely dead.];W[jm];B[ik];W[hj]C[At 16:50, Chang Hao still has 34 minutes left, Choi Cheolhan only has 6 minutes left, according to Ing rules, after using all regular time, there will be 2 point penalty for every 35 minutes.];B[hm]LB[im:a][kk:b][nk:c][jn:d][jo:e][in:f][mm:g]C[B113: Black can attach at 'a' if W 'b', then B 'c', W 'd', B 'e', W 'f' and B 'g', White is no good.

In the game, B113 is inexplicable, Choi Cheolhan probably wants to capture White's two stones in the lower left corner.];W[mm]C[After W114, Black's center group is already dead.]
;B[rg]C[B115 is endgame tactic.];W[qg];B[qe];W[rf];B[im];W[kk];B[io];W[jn];B[jo];W[nl];B[cq]C[B125: Black attacks White's two stones, the set pattern here is very important.];W[dl]
;B[ck];W[fp]C[W128: White is a little difficult.];B[fn]C[After Black jumps with B129, it seems Black's hope of winning is relatively bigger.];W[eq];B[er];W[gn]LB[eo:a]C[W132 is a tesuji, the variations here are very complicated, with B133 Black can consider to make the diagonal extension at 'a'.];B[gm]C[At 18:30, Choi Cheolhan already incurs penalty twice (4 points), Chang Hao once (2 points), now Chang Hao has 1 hour and 35 minutes left, Choi Cheolhan has 50 minutes left (each player has three chances to take penalty and get 35 minutes).];W[en]C[W134 is shape, this shape can't die.];B[fo];W[gq]
;B[fr];W[eo]C[B139: Black wants to atari up, it needs courage.];B[gr];W[hp]C[W140 is a good move. Now Black can only consider endgame tactics.];B[iq];W[in];B[go];W[ho];B[hn];W[em];B[fm];W[gp]
;B[dk];W[bo]LB[cp:a]C[W150 is steady, if White blocks at 'a', then Black will try to kill by striking at 150, Chang Hao's dodging sequence in this area is very brilliant.];B[lp];W[mr]LB[fb:a]C[W152: White can take tenuki and take advantage in sente by playing at 'a'.];B[mp];W[ns];B[ps];W[mq];B[mn];W[np]
;B[rd];W[pf];B[kq];W[el];B[ek];W[lb]LB[fb:a]C[After making life in the lower left corner, Chang Hao already wins the game, W140 is a decisive move. Not sure with W164 why White doesn't attach at 'a' first.];B[kc];W[gb];B[fb];W[kb];B[jc];W[jb]LB[oc:a]C[W170: For White to jump at 'a' is better.]
