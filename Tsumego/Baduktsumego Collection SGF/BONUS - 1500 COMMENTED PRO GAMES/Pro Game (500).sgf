;B[nq]C[B7 making one-space extension is solid.];W[fq];B[cj];W[cl];B[cf];W[gc];B[ej]C[Through B13, the opening is normal.];W[ch]LB[bd:a]C[After the invasion of W14, White has no powerful follow-up tactic, if I were White, I will simply jump to 'a'.
];B[dg];W[ce];B[be]
;W[bd];B[bf];W[nc];B[pf];W[qc]LB[pb:a][ld:b][cn:c][dn:d]C[W22 entering the corner is too greedy, making White thin on the whole board. White normally will make knight at 'a', next B22 and W 'b'. This way when Black invades at 'c', White can press at 'd' since White is favorable in ladder.

;W[gn];B[el]LB[bo:a][fm:b]C[The jump of B41 is very calm, perhaps Black feels his situation is not bad. For Black to make diagonal at 'a' is more positive. If White jumps out at 41, Black can fight by making diagonal at 'b'.
];W[bn];B[jp]LB[mo:a]C[The invasion of B43 is wrong direction, here is not place to play. For Black to make knight at 'a' is just vital point.];W[qo];B[qp];W[op];B[np];W[no]
;B[mo];W[nn];B[oq];W[ok]C[From W44 to W52, White turns body around lightly, it is not interesting for Black to capture one stone W6.];B[qm];W[og];B[ng];W[oi];B[mk];W[nh];B[ph];W[qj];B[rj]
;W[qi];B[oh];W[qh];B[pg];W[ni]C[Following W54, White's play is smooth, White has condensed Black's moyo on the right side, B57 almost becomes useless, White already breaks up the situation.

];B[lo];W[lh]LB[nd:a]C[But next White plays almost the losing move. First, the jump of W68 is too slow. White certainly should extend at 'a', this way White is not running out alone, perhaps White can attack Black instead.];B[nd];W[ck];B[bj];W[hq]LB[om:a][po:b][qn:c]C[Next W72, this move itself is fine and also the biggest on the board. The question is, White should first make exchange of W 'a' and B 'b' (if Black takes tenuki, White can block crossover at 'c', Black's three stones will be captured ).]
;B[bm];W[cm];B[bo];W[co];B[an];W[dn];B[dm];W[bn];B[se];W[sd];B[cn];W[do];B[ol]C[After Black attaches and separates with B85, White already is showing a big losing trend.

;W[rk];B[pk];W[rl];B[rm];W[nk];B[nl];W[rp];B[rq];W[fk];B[dk];W[fh]C[W94 and W96 are uncommon moves.
];B[bn]C[Due to B95, with B97 Black already captures three white stones, White clearly incurs loss. I think, White aims to mess up situation, since White wouldn't have any chance if playing normally.

;W[dh];B[ef];W[bi]C[The diagonal of W100 is a desperate play in an unfavorable situation. White first cuts Black's way back, in fact, it is very far-fetched.];B[fe];W[fd];B[he];W[hd];B[fi];W[eh];B[ie]LB[gh:a]C[B107: If Black plays hane at 'a', White may get captured. In the game, Black elects to play steadily.];W[hh]
;B[id];W[ic];B[ge];W[ed];B[gi];W[gg];B[kf];W[jg];B[kd];W[kc];B[je];W[jc];B[iq]C[B121 is the biggest endgame on the board, Black is already way ahead in territory.

;B[kh];W[kg]LB[ki:a][li:b][mh:c]C[After B135, if White pushes at 'a', then B 'b', W 'c' and B136, Black's big dragon is already alive, however White's eye space is not enough, so White has no choices but to make exchange.];B[ki];W[lf];B[mg];W[jh];B[ke];W[le];B[gh];W[ff]
;B[hg];W[ee];B[jj]C[After B147, Black is much closer to victory.];W[rg];B[sf];W[sj];B[oa]LB[im:a][gm:b]C[B149 and B151 are very big, but to make knight at 'a' is more steady, since next B151 and B 'b' are miai, Black must get one, White is difficult to overturn the game.
];W[jn];B[kn]LB[kp:a]C[The atari of B153 is the first step to defeat, Black should simply play atari at 'a'.]
;W[kp];B[jm];W[ij];B[hi];W[kr];B[jr];W[kq];B[hr]LB[in:a]C[B161 is the last losing move. If Black takes at 'a', Black certainly wins the game. Not sure whether it is due to time pressure, Cho Sonjin makes such a simple mistake, giving away a good game.];W[in]C[After W162, there is already a loophole inside Black's territory.];B[gr];W[jk]
