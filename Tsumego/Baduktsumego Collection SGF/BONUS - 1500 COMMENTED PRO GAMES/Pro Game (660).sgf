;W[di];B[fe];W[ee]C[The attachment of W8 is standard joseki.];B[ef];W[ed];B[cg];W[ff];B[eg];W[gf]C[Through W14, it forms an uncommon Japanese joseki.];B[oc];W[co];B[fc]C[The jump of B17 is the follow-up tactic of joseki.]
;W[fd];B[hd]LB[ge:a]C[B19: If Black directly escapes at 'a', White has the good jump at 19, since White is favorable in the ladder, locally Black is not good. B19 is a variation.];W[jd]C[With W20, White continues the strategy of sacrificing two stones.];B[ge];W[hc];B[hf];W[gd];B[he];W[ic];B[gh]C[Through B27, it forms a new shape, both sides obtain some profit.];W[dp]C[W28: White elects to play a simple joseki and aims to seek safety earlier.]

;W[oq];B[ro];W[rn];B[qo];W[qn];B[qp]LB[po:a][oo:b]C[B47 is questionable, Black still should push at 'a', to exchange with W 'b', then playing B47.];W[po]C[After White connects with W48, White becomes quite thick and can be satisfied.];B[cl];W[dl];B[cm]
;W[dk];B[dm];W[em];B[bj];W[en];B[kq];W[qf];B[qh]LB[mc:a]C[The invasion of B59 is a little unreasonable. White is very thick on the board, now to take any action is too early. 

Black can consider to jump at 'a', this way the whole game is relatively balanced.];W[of];B[oh];W[oj];B[mh]
;W[mf];B[mc];W[rd];B[rc];W[pd];B[qc];W[mj];B[kh]LB[lg:a]C[The shape of B71 is not right, Black should make diagonal at 'a', to connect steadily is better.];W[pc];B[pb];W[od];B[nc]
;W[qe];B[pg];W[ne];B[ni];W[nj];B[bc]C[Black again grabs territory with B81, Black is clearly leading in territory.];W[gi]LB[bi:a]C[But the attachment of W82 is severe, next White can attach at 'a', Black is very confused on how to answer.];B[cj]C[Black has no other choice but to strengthen with B83.];W[hh];B[gg];W[ii]C[But after White hangs with W86, Black can only connect with dame and is very painful.]
;B[jg];W[ld];B[hg]C[Especially for B89, it perhaps the right move, but Black is really painful.];W[jo]C[W90 is a good point, White encloses a big territory in the center, White starts to take the lead.];B[ip];W[lp];B[io];W[lq];B[kp];W[ko];B[im];W[jm]
;B[jl];W[il];B[jn];W[km];B[lr];W[kn];B[lo]C[The cut of B105 is a local good move.];W[mo]C[To exchange with W106, Black takes a little advantage.];B[in];W[mr];B[cb];W[df]LB[dg:a][de:b][eh:c]C[W110 is an asking move, if Black connects at 'a', then W6 becomes light, if Black cuts at 'b', White will have the sente move at 'c'.]
;B[fi]C[B111: Black counterattacks.];W[de];B[cf];W[dg];B[gj];W[cd];B[bd];W[ik];B[eh]C[Through B119, although locally the gain and loss is not clear, but overall, White's advantage becomes more materialized.];W[kr];B[jr];W[db]
;B[jj];W[li];B[lh];W[ij];B[ji];W[jk];B[ks];W[so]LB[br:a]C[The hane and connection of W130 is not necessary, if turning at 'a', White can easily win the game.];B[sp];W[sn];B[br]C[B133 is a game-deciding move.]
;W[ep]C[W134 is a steady move, the situation is still to White's advantage.];B[fp];W[fo];B[nr]C[B137: Black again grabs a big point.];W[os];B[ms];W[sr];B[ps];W[fq]C[W142: White still doesn't initiate the ko, White is calm.];B[gp];W[fr];B[er]
;W[es];B[dr];W[ar];B[bs];W[bn]C[W150: White makes life.];B[rr]C[B151: Black can only reinforce the corner.];W[pi];B[mp];W[ln];B[no];W[nn];B[qg]
;W[lc]C[After White grabs the big endgame with W158, White's small victory already can't be changed.];B[kj];W[kk];B[dh];W[bm];B[bl];W[lb];B[re];W[rf];B[sd];W[dj];B[ci];W[ri]
