;W[od];B[oe];W[ne];B[pe];W[nd];B[pc];W[dh];B[ec]C[After the joseki in the upper right corner, Black can only hane from outside with B13.];W[ed]LB[eb:a]C[W14: For White to hane at 'a' is perhaps still better, the variation in the real game is almost inevitable.];B[dd];W[fc]
;B[eb];W[cc];B[fb];W[ee];B[ef];W[gc];B[fd];W[fe];B[gd];W[ff];B[hc];W[df];B[nf]C[Locally, White takes a little advantage, but in terms of the whole game, since the efficiency of W6, W8 and W10 is low, the hane of B29 is smooth, White's three stones are very heavy, Black can be satisfied.]
;W[mf];B[mg];W[ng];B[of];W[lf];B[lg];W[pd];B[qe];W[ld];B[pl];W[jq];B[cn];W[co]LB[bo:a]C[W42: White should make the knight's move at 'a'.]
;B[dn];W[fp];B[cj];W[cl]C[B45 making three space extension is one conception, White's invasion is inevitable.];B[dl];W[bl];B[cf]LB[eg:a]C[The atari of B49 makes White a little difficult, if White takes at 'a', ......];W[dg];B[bd];W[bc];B[bf]
;W[cg];B[bg]LB[bh:a]C[......, Black will not turn with B55, instead Black will jump over at 'a'.];W[bh];B[ah]C[The hane of B57 is a good move.];W[ag]C[As to this, the throw-in of W58 can't be omitted, otherwise in the corner capturing race, White is always one liberty short.];B[af];W[bi];B[cd];W[ad];B[be];W[db]
;B[bj];W[ai];B[di];W[fh];B[fi];W[gi];B[fj];W[bn];B[gh]LB[ab:a]C[In the game, Black can strike at 'a', the corner is either seki or Black can ko-kill White, and Black already takes a lot of advantage on the outside, when Black cuts with B73, White still has to escape due to short liberty. Black is already favorable.];W[fg];B[hh];W[hf]
;B[jg];W[ie];B[jd]LB[jc:a]C[B79 is a careless move. Black should make one-space extension at 'a' to avoid hidden troubles.];W[kg];B[kh];W[kf];B[li];W[qn]C[The invasion of W84 is inevitable.];B[qp]LB[ql:a][qq:b]C[B85: I once considered to double up at 'a', but after White attaches over at 'b', Black is not easy to answer, so I elected to make the diagonal of B85.]
;W[rl];B[qk];W[rk];B[rj];W[on];B[qj];W[ro]LB[np:a][hq:b]C[The diagonal of W92 is questionable, White should make the knight's move at 'a', alleviating the pressure of Black's invasion at 'b'.];B[mq];W[nm];B[hq];W[fr]
;B[ho];W[jo];B[gn];W[hr];B[eq]C[Black invades with B95, although White can attach over with W100, the strike of B101 is severe!];W[fq];B[ep];W[dq];B[eo];W[er];B[bo];W[bp]LB[bm:a][ao:b][am:c]C[Through B107, Black is left with the tactic of B 'a', W 'b' and B 'c' to capture W46 and W48, Black is clearly favorable.]
;B[ip]LB[ab:a]C[B109 is an impulsive move, Black should strike at 'a' right away to probe White, White is very difficult.];W[mp]C[W110: White seeks to dodge.];B[np];W[lq];B[no];W[mo];B[mr]LB[pm:a][pn:b][nn:c]C[When W114, B115 is slow! Black should peep at 'a', next W 'b' and B 'c', White is very difficult to retreat as a whole.];W[mn]
;B[rp];W[nk]LB[mk:a]C[W118 is a selection in an unfavorable situation, the original move is to make the knight's move at 'a'.];B[ml]LB[nl:a][pn:b]C[B119: Black misses the chance to set the tone at one stroke. Black should wedge at 'a', White can only play atari at 119, then Black can wedge at 'b', White is already being separated and can't look after both sides.];W[nl];B[pm];W[pn];B[nn];W[om];B[mm]
;W[nq];B[nr];W[lj];B[km]LB[kl:a]C[The jump of B129 is careless, if Black jumps to 'a', White most likely will collapse.];W[mi];B[nh];W[kl]C[The attachment of W132 is alert!];B[ln];W[op];B[oq];W[oo]
;B[nq];W[mk];B[lp];W[ir]C[As a result, Black only captures three stones, the whole white group becomes thicker, Black almost gains nothing!];B[ji]LB[ab:a]C[B141: Black should strike at 'a'.];W[ni];B[oh];W[oi];B[ph];W[jb]C[W146 is good judgement!];B[ab]LB[da:a][ca:b][bb:c]C[B147 is miscalculation, Black should play hane at 'a', next W 'b' and B 'c', this way it may make cyclic three ko situation and lead to no result.]
;W[bb]LB[ac:a][ib:b]C[W148 is alert! Normally White can only connect at 'a', W148 leaves Black a chance to make life together, but if White doubles at 'b' in sente, Black's whole group is dangerous!];B[ca];W[da];B[kb];W[kc];B[jc];W[lb];B[ib];W[ac]LB[ja:a]C[After White strengthens with W156, if Black takes at 'a' with B157, the situation is very close.]
;B[bm]LB[ka:a]C[B157 is the losing move! Black overlooks White's sente move at 'a'.];W[ao];B[aj];W[ch];B[am];W[ka];B[nb];W[ia];B[ha];W[id];B[gb]C[When White pushes with W166, with B167 Black almost loses common sense.]
;W[ic];B[ja]C[In the real game, it forms a ko, Black is heavy.];W[ll];B[lm];W[ia];B[rm];W[qm];B[ja];W[pi];B[qi];W[ia];B[ql];W[sm]
;B[ja];W[ko];B[lo];W[ia];B[sk];W[rn];B[ja];W[cm]C[When White cuts with W188, Black can only eliminate the ko.];B[kb];W[dm];B[la];W[dk]C[When W190 and W192, White already successfully turns the game around.]
