;W[fq];B[de];W[ce];B[cf];W[cd];B[df];W[fc];B[dj]C[The opening from B5 to B13 is popular recently.];W[qj];B[oc];W[qm]C[White splits the right side in sente with W14 and W16, which are steady, to approach at 15 is also possible.];B[nq]
;W[dk]C[As to Black's shape on the left side, W18 is recent study result.];B[dd];W[cc];B[ck];W[cl];B[cj]C[B21 and B23 are roughly acceptable, White is a little favorable.];W[dl];B[cp]C[B25: Black turns the body quickly, showing Chen Yaoye likes territory.];W[cq];B[bq];W[co];B[bp]
;W[do];B[dq];W[cr];B[dr];W[br];B[ar];W[lq]LB[rp:a][kq:b]C[W36 is urgent, for White to play at 'a' is wrong direction, after Black makes two-space extension at 'b', White's thickness on the left side can't be put into use.];B[qo];W[lo];B[fr]C[B39: For Black to reserve this move is also not bad.]
;W[bo];B[bs];W[eq];B[er];W[gq];B[qh];W[pr];B[or];W[rp]LB[ej:a]C[W46 and W48 are local good moves, because of these moves, Black's corner is not safe. However, for White to play hane at 'a' is better.];B[ro];W[pq];B[op]
;W[rr];B[qq];W[rq];B[qp];W[qr];B[mp];W[rn]LB[so:a]C[W58 is a clever asking move. With B59, if Black descends at 'a', after White lives the corner, White takes advantage.];B[sn]C[B59: It is hard to judge whether B59 is good or bad.];W[lp]LB[so:a]C[W60 is huge, the corner is ko-alive, but the timing of initiating the ko is not easy to control, therefore Black also has the mind to descend at 'a' with B59.]
;B[pl]C[Following B61, Black starts to attack White, but here White is not difficult to handle.];W[ql];B[pk];W[pm];B[om];W[pj];B[qk];W[rk];B[rj];W[rl];B[nl];W[ri];B[oj]
;W[oi];B[nj];W[ph];B[qf];W[rh];B[ni];W[qg]C[After W80, the local variation comes to an end, the ko fight in the lower-right corner is the key for the game.];B[hc];W[pf]C[B81 and W82 are miai good points.];B[ek]C[B83 is strong, here is the vital point for both sides' moyo, so far, Black's situation is not bad.];W[el];B[fk]
;W[fl];B[gk];W[fe];B[he];W[fg];B[nf];W[mc]C[W92: Black must invade deeply, otherwise White can't fight for a win.];B[kc]LB[nd:a]C[B93: For Black to make diagonal at 'a' is more solid, this also will help the ko fight in the lower-right corner.];W[oe]LB[pc:a]C[W94 is the vital point, aiming to crosscut at 'a', Black is not easy to handle.]
;B[nd];W[ne];B[me]LB[md:a]C[B97: If Black presses at 'a', Black is also damaging, but in the game, it leads to a ko in the corner, Black's situation is even worse.];W[pc];B[pd];W[od];B[nc];W[qc];B[rd];W[pb];B[md];W[pe]LB[rc:a]C[W106: If White plays at 'a', both sides are heavy in the ko, in the game, both sides are light, Liu Xing perhaps has favorable consciousness.]
;B[rc];W[rb];B[sb];W[qa];B[ob];W[qe];B[oa];W[pa];B[ra];W[sa];B[be];W[gb]LB[ed:a]C[W118: If White doesn't answer, B 'a' is severe.]
;B[ra];W[mm]C[W120: White is happy with this ko threat, White takes advantage in sente.];B[mn];W[sa];B[ln]LB[nn:a]C[B121 and B123: Black is impulsive, Black should tolerate at 'a'.];W[mo];B[no];W[nn]C[W124 and W126 are clever moves.];B[on];W[kn]C[With the exchange up to the atari of W128, Black clearly incurs loss.]
;B[ra];W[eh]C[W130: White seeks ko threats, Black already has no answer.];B[qb];W[bg]C[White captures one stone with W132, Black incurs loss in two places, the loss is more than the gain in the upper-right corner, the situation has been turned around.];B[cg];W[bf];B[bh];W[bd];B[ag];W[ae];B[fd]C[B139 is damaging, in order to reinforce the cut in sente.];W[ed]
;B[ff];W[ch];B[dh];W[ef];B[gl];W[gm];B[hm];W[hn]C[White encloses territory with W146 and W148, White's advantage can't be altered.];B[lm];W[im];B[hl];W[il];B[bl]
;W[bm];B[km]LB[ei:a]C[B155 is overplay! Black should reinforce at 'a'.];W[ej]C[The cut of W156 is severe!];B[bj];W[al];B[ak]C[Black can't look after both sides, afterwards, there are several ko fights, but Black is far-fetched all the time.];W[bk];B[ei];W[fj];B[gj];W[fi]
