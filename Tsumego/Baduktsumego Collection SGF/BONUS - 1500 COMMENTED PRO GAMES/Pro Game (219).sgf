;B[cf];W[cd];B[qo];W[op];B[oc]C[From B1 to B11, Black plays freely, this very fits Luo Xihe's personality.];W[cn];B[fq];W[ck];B[qk];W[df]LB[jc:a]C[W16: White can consider to make extension at 'a' on the side.];B[ic]C[Black gets to grab the excellent point with B17, White is not happy.]
;W[kq];B[iq];W[dg]LB[qi:a]C[W20: White can consider to invade at 'a', here there is no problem if White doesn't play now.];B[kd];W[qi];B[qg];W[oi];B[ok];W[mi];B[mk];W[nf]LB[ki:a]C[W28: For White to stick th head out at 'a' is better, at the top White's not fearful of Black's territory.]
;B[ph]C[B29 is sharp! White's step is a little bigger, Black can't miss the chance to punish.];W[pf]LB[pi:a][nh:b]C[W30: If White connects at 'a', Black's strong move at 'b' worries White.];B[oh];W[nh];B[pi]TR[qi]C[Through B33, Black can capture the marked white stone and can be satisfied.];W[nd];B[od];W[oe]LB[me:a][nc:b]C[After W36, Black peeps at 'a' and White is not comfortable, so with W36 White can consider to block at 'b'.]
;B[me];W[md];B[dl];W[ld]C[When B39, White can't answer the ladder breaker with W40.];B[ke];W[le];B[cl]C[B43: Black pierces through, it is huge, Black can be satisfied.];W[kf];B[co]LB[jf:a]C[B45 is very big, the original move is to handle the top by playing at 'a'. In the game, Black takes tenuki and it is relentless, as to this if White can't attack black efficiently at the top, Black will take advantage.];W[re]LB[ie:a]C[W46: White originally wants to force Black to answer here, unexpectedly Black takes tenuki, White's situation suddenly deteriorates. With W46 White should attack Black at 'a'.]

;W[rf];B[qb];W[kc];B[kg]C[B63 is alert! The two black stones are already light.];W[lf];B[nc];W[mb];B[mc];W[lc];B[hf]C[When B69, Black handles well from both the left and right sides, Black is favorable.];W[dk];B[bk]LB[el:a]C[B71: For Black to simply extend at 'a' is good enough.]
;W[bj];B[bl];W[cq];B[bp];W[ek];B[bi];W[cj];B[el];W[fl];B[fm];W[gm];B[fn];W[hh]LB[gc:a]C[The meaning of W84 is not clear, here White should destroy Black's base at 'a', now allowing Black to settle easily.]
;B[gd];W[aj];B[fg];W[fh];B[gl];W[fk];B[fb]C[B91: Black lives cleanly, White's territory is obviously not enough.];W[ib];B[hb];W[pn];B[qn];W[pl];B[ql]
;W[gq]C[W98 is a game-deciding move!];B[hp]C[B99: But Black doesn't give an inch, instead want to capture all! Here Wang Xi used several reserved times and still can't see how to make life.];W[fr];B[dq];W[id];B[jc];W[jd];B[jb];W[je];B[mq]LB[hm:a]C[The meaning of B107 is not clear, Black should directly play atari at 'a'.];W[lp]
;B[hm];W[eq];B[dr];W[kb];B[qa];W[hc];B[ia];W[gc];B[fc];W[hd];B[gb];W[go]C[W120: White makes the last ditch effort.];B[gn]LB[io:a]C[B121 is soft-hearted! Black should seal off at 'a', really can't see how White makes life. Of course in the game, White is also in a bitter battle.]

;B[lo];W[ko];B[ln];W[kn];B[jn];W[lm];B[jm];W[ep]C[Through W142, although White makes life, but White also incurs a big loss on the right side, overall Black's advantage is still big.];B[mn];W[no];B[km];W[nr];B[mr]
;W[rp];B[fe]LB[er:a]C[B149: Black should first take advantage at 'a'.];W[eo];B[or];W[nn];B[kp];W[pr];B[qp];W[qq];B[ro];W[do];B[nq]

;B[gg];W[eh];B[hi];W[dn];B[em];W[gj];B[ii]LB[ih:a]C[B179 is a bad move! To play at 'a' is better.];W[jh]C[W180 is a good move! The situation becomes intense instantly.];B[ji];W[kh];B[ki]
;W[li];B[jg];W[ih];B[lg];W[lh];B[mg]LB[lj:a]C[B185 and B189 are almost losing moves! Although Black incurs loss in endgame, Black still can ensure victory by playing endgame calmly at 'a'.];W[il];B[im];W[if]LB[lj:a]TR[hi][ii][ji][ki]C[W192 is tesuji! Since W 'a' is a good move, Black can only sacrifice four marked stones in order to make life the big group! Now the game is about to be overturned.]
;B[ng];W[og];B[ig];W[hg];B[ie];W[he];B[if];W[ge];B[gf];W[ef]LB[lj:a]C[But nobody knows, White surprisingly still can't win even if taking such a big advantage! If knowing this earlier, with W202 White should first confuse Black at 'a', this way White takes advantage at the maximum limit, White will win small.];B[pg];W[of]
;B[nj];W[lj];B[ni];W[kk];B[jk];W[jj];B[fd];W[ka];B[ja];W[pa];B[pc];W[ik]LB[na:a]C[W216 is an unbelievable mistake, Wang Xi (White) concentrated on counting points and obviously forgot the sente connection at 'a'. The more unbelievable is, Black unexpectedly didn't take either! It is hard to believe such thing will ever happen! This kind of drama will only appear in fast games.]
