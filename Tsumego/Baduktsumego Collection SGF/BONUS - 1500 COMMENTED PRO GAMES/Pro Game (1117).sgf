;W[gq];B[cf];W[fd];B[bd];W[nc];B[pf];W[cc];B[ci];W[pb];B[qc]C[The play of B15 is worth discussion.];W[kc]C[In the opening through W16, White has nothing to complain.];B[cq]
;W[cp];B[dq];W[ep];B[fr];W[fq];B[gr];W[bq];B[br];W[er];B[bp];W[hr]C[From B17 to W28, Black gains some territory, but White becomes very thick.];B[po]LB[ok:a][je:b]C[Next B29 is questionable move, now Black should jump to 'a' or directly hang at 'b'.]
;W[dh];B[ch];W[df];B[je]C[After W30 and W32, the play of B33 is already one step late.];W[ce]C[White is very happy to hang with W34 in sente.];B[bf];W[ld];B[jc];W[kf]LB[qi:a]C[W36 and W38 are attacking attitude. Once White becomes thick, the invasion at 'a' is Black's weak point.];B[gd]C[As to the attack of W38, B39 is overplay.]
;W[gc]C[Being counterattacked severely by W40, Black sinks into a difficult situation.];B[hc];W[hd];B[ge];W[he];B[fc];W[gb];B[fe];W[fb];B[ed];W[hf]C[White's sequence from W40 to W50 is Lee Sedol's top-rated sharp play.];B[eb]
;W[db]LB[ea:a][ec:b]C[Especially the diagonal of W52 is just right, making Black very painful. If Black wants to block crossover, Black has to descend at 'a', this way White is first left with the throw-in ko tactic at 'b'.];B[ec];W[ea];B[fa];W[ga];B[hb];W[da];B[ee];W[de];B[fg];W[jb]
;B[id];W[ib];B[ha];W[fa];B[ic];W[be];B[hg];W[gg]C[The wedge of W70 is good move, Black suddenly collapses.];B[gh];W[gf]LB[ig:a]C[W72: White is greedy, only if White plays atari at 'a', White is already very favorable.];B[kb]
;W[lb];B[ef]C[W75 looks crude but is a clever move, unexpectedly Black captures W30 one stone in sente, which was overlooked by Lee Sedol.];W[ig]LB[jf:a]C[Just because of this, White loses calmness with W76, White should press at 'a' instead, this way the situation will be still to White's advantage.];B[dg];W[ae];B[jf]C[After pushing with W79, Black is left with cut point.];W[jg];B[hh];W[if];B[kg];W[lf]
;B[ji];W[ii];B[dc];W[cb];B[lg];W[ih];B[mf]C[By using B85, B89 and B91, Black turns the right side moyo into territory.];W[le];B[li]LB[ok:a]C[B93: Black should calmly defend at 'a', this way Black is not bad for the whole game.];W[ok]C[The cap of W94 is a bold move!];B[qm]LB[nl:a]C[B95 is weak. Even if losing this game, Black has to fight desperately by sealing off at 'a'.]

;B[ng];W[mp]C[After White takes advantage in sente and grabs the big point with W110, White is already clearly favorable for the game.];B[mo]C[Following B111, Black loses common sense.];W[no];B[np]LB[nl:a]C[If knowing this earlier, for Black to attack strongly at 'a' is much better. Although Black may not kill White easily, Black will have more chances.];W[op];B[nn];W[oo];B[on];W[pp];B[qp]
