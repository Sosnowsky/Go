Translation:GoGameWorld.];B[pd]C[As everyone knows, Cho Hunhyun 9p and Rui Naiwei 9p represent the current male and female highest level in the world Go arena, both players belong to style of strength and fight.];W[dp]C[Long time ago, Ms. Rui and Yang Hui,  these two female players,  practiced together with me in Shanghai Sports Center, so I am relatively familiar with Ms. Rui. At that time, I'm a 1-kyu student, and they two are only about 8-9 kyu, I used to give both 2-stone handicap. Ms. Rui is introverted by nature, she doesn't have the women player's common characteristic of "entangling to the end". When playing with her, you need to be patient and prepare for a prolonged war.];B[qp]C[Cho Hunhyun is one of Korean "Top Four Wang", his skill is relatively comprehensive and belongs to the style of strength and fight, Cho 9p not only plays Go games well, he is also a person of excellent character. Although he is in a very high position, but Cho 9p is always easy of approach. Now let's see one game between these two players in the 2003 Chinese National Go Team tournament, in this game, both sides don't want to give way, the game is very intense and brilliant!]
(;W[oq]LB[dd:a][qj:b][ql:c][qf:d][nd:e][lc:f]C[After the small-point of B3, White directly approaches the corner with W4, this is Cho 9p's favorite play. The usual play is, after White takes the empty corner at 'a', Black will protect the corner at 4, then W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 'e' and White will check at 'f' (see var a).];B[dd];W[ql];B[po];W[qi]C[W6 and W8 are good moves to open up the situation.];B[fq];W[cn]
;B[lq];W[qf]
(;B[np]LB[nc:a][oo:b][on:c][no:d][nn:e][mn:f][mo:g]C[The knight-sealing move of B13 seems ordinary, but this move is Black's losing move, the usual play is for Black to answer at 'a', if White plays at 'b', then the hane of B 'c' is a good move, after White extends to 'd', Black can continue to press at 'e', W 'f' and B 'g', I think this result is better than the real game (see var a).];W[nc];B[pf];W[pg];B[qe];W[of];B[pe]
;W[rf]
(;B[qg]LB[og:a][ng:b][oh:c][ne:d][ph:e][rg:f][ni:g]C[The cut of B21 is a clever play. If Black cuts at 'a', then W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 21, W 'e', B 'f' and W 'g', Black can not be satisfied (see var a).];W[rg];B[og];W[ph];B[nf];W[md]C[After the small diagonal of W26, Black seems a little painful.]
;B[oc]LB[oe:a]C[The hit of B27 is a good move, it is better than taking at 'a' directly.];W[ob];B[pb];W[od]C[However, after White hanes and ataris with W28 and W30, Black's shape is not fluent.];B[oe];W[pc];B[qc];W[ic];B[gc]LB[cf:a][cd:b][ci:c]C[After Black protects the corner with the big knight's move, White enters the corner at 3-3 and White is too greedy, the proper move is to approach the corner at 'a', if Black stands at 'b', then White can make the two-space extension at 'c', White is a little favorable on the whole board.]

;W[ie];B[hd];W[bd];B[be];W[bc]LB[ib:a]C[The hane and connection of W46 and W48 can also be considered to stand at 'a', it may be better.];B[jc]C[The atari of B49 is very big, White seems a little thin.];W[qb]C[As far as the first fifty moves are concerned, as I said earlier, both players have a special fondness for fights.];B[oc];W[kc];B[ib];W[pc]

(;B[ig]LB[ef:a][eg:b][df:c][dg:d][ce:e]C[The jump of B115 is the losing move, the jump at 'a' would make the right shape, followed by W 'b', B 'c', W 'd' and B 'e', this way the game would be far from over (see var a).];W[fc];B[fd];W[gd];B[ff]LB[ef:a]C[The cut of B119 is not good either, Black still should jump to 'a', this game would be more complicated.];W[fe];B[ef]
