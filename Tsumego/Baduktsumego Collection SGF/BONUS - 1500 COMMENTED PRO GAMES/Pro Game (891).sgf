Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[pd];W[dd];B[qp];W[dp];B[kq]C[The opening of B1, B3 and B5 is very rarely used by Wang Lei, not sure whether it is specially prepared against Lee Changho.]
;W[gq];B[op]LB[mq:a]C[Black protects the corner with B7, but it is left with the invasion at 'a', Black has the state of mind to make an extension on the right side.];W[qj];B[cf];W[ch];B[cc];W[cd];B[dc];W[ed];B[bd];W[be];B[bc]
;W[ce];B[fc];W[qm]LB[co:a]C[W20: For Black to defend with the diagonal at 'a' is also very enticing.];B[cp];W[cq];B[co];W[bq];B[do];W[ck]LB[ep:a]C[The extension of W26 is very practical, if White simply retreats at 'a', Black will get to play at the excellent point of W26, White can't be happy.];B[ep]
;W[dq];B[fn]LB[eq:a][eo:b][dr:c]C[B29: Black can consider to attach down at 'a', next W 'b' and B 'c', next the variations are very complicated, but Black can take the chance to sacrifice three stones on the left side, opening up the situation at the bottom.];W[fp]C[Through W30, Black's play appears a little tasteless.];B[qh];W[fk]C[W32 is Lee Changho's unique style, lightly attacking.];B[cl];W[dl];B[cm];W[bk]C[The exchange from B33 to W36 is damaging to Black.]
;B[pl];W[ql]LB[rn:a]C[W38 is questionable, White should make the diagonal extension at 'a'.];B[pj];W[pk];B[ok];W[qk];B[pi];W[ol];B[nk]LB[fd:a][om:b]C[Through B45, the attachment at 'a' and the atari at 'b' become miai, White fails.]
;W[pq]C[The exchange of W46 and Black's connection is even more inexplicable, since White already decides to take tenuki, the variation here should be reserved.];B[pp];W[ge];B[om]C[The atari of B49 is severe! White has no choice but to make life painfully.];W[ro];B[rp];W[nl];B[pm];W[rh];B[rg];W[ri];B[ml]C[Black gets to capture two stones in a ladder with B57, Black is very happy! Black establishes his superiority at one stroke!]
;W[kr]C[The attachment of W58 is a marvelous move, Lee Changho also realizes the situation is severe.];B[jq]LB[lr:a][lq:b][lp:c][jr:d]C[However not sure how come Wang Lei changed tone! With B59 for Black to hane at 'a' is the simplest move, if White cuts at 'b', Black can first atari at 'c', after White extends, Black can atari at 'd' again, White has no follow-up tactic.];W[lq];B[lp];W[mr];B[jr]C[Next the play of B61 and B63 again clearly contradict with each other, since Black wants to attack and kill White, with B61 Black should directly turn down, White is still in a bitter battle.];W[mp];B[nq]
;W[lo];B[kp];W[mq];B[mo];W[oq]C[Through W70, Black already can't kill White.];B[qr];W[np];B[ks]LB[no:a]C[B73: Black has only attach at 'a'.];W[qq];B[rr];W[oo]C[W74 and W76 are clever moves, Black is already hard to resist.]
;B[no];W[po];B[rq];W[nn];B[mn];W[mm];B[ln];W[lm];B[kn];W[nm];B[qo];W[qn];B[or]C[Through B89, the gain and loss between two sides in the exchange is not proportional, the situation has been turned around instantly.]

;B[me];W[il]C[Later on White safely proceeds. Through B130, Black already has no any chance of winning.];B[jh];W[nr];B[pr];W[hn];B[go];W[ho];B[eq];W[eo];B[er];W[en];B[dr]
