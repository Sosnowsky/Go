;W[oc];B[cn];W[fq];B[ld];W[dh];B[cj];W[pe];B[pd];W[od];B[oe];W[md];B[le]C[As to W16, B17 looks like a planned a move. Facing with new moves, the young player obviously doesn't prepare enough.];W[of]LB[qe:a]C[W18: For White to directly attach down at 'a' is also possible.]
;B[ne];W[me];B[nf];W[mf];B[og];W[lc]LB[qe:a]C[With respect to the result, with W24 at any rate White should attach down at 'a' to fight, of course the variation will be complicated and is worth more study.];B[kc];W[lf];B[lb];W[mc];B[pf]C[From B19 to B29, White incurs a big loss.]
;W[de]LB[jc:a]C[Following W30, White wants to obtain sente and pincer at 'a'.];B[cd];W[cc];B[dg];W[ci]LB[jc:a]C[But Gu Li's answer is strong and unyielding, the crude move of W34 makes White already difficult to take tenuki, with W34 White should directly pincer at 'a', this way although White is not good, White still can fight.];B[dj];W[df];B[dd];W[ed];B[cf]
;W[cg];B[eg];W[ee];B[bg];W[ch];B[eh];W[bh];B[af]C[From B37 to B47, White sinks into a difficult situation.];W[ah];B[bc]C[Here White must capture Black but couldn't, however even if Black is being captured, it is not a big problem for Black.];W[bb];B[bd]C[After this fight, White is completely stuck in mire.]
;W[bf];B[be];W[ag]C[The sequence from W48 to W54 leads to a ko, which can't be eliminated with just one move.];B[ec]C[After Black cuts from outside with B55, Black already takes lot of advantage.];W[fc];B[eb];W[cb];B[fb];W[gd];B[gc];W[ge];B[fd]
;W[fe];B[ab]C[Then Black initiates the ko with B65, White has to spend three moves to kill Black, on the whole board White only gets less than 22 points!];W[ac];B[ad]C[After the ko fight, the situation equals to Zhou Ruiyang gives two stones to Gu Li! Who can give handicap-2 game to Gu Li?];W[bf];B[ep]LB[cp:a]C[In terms of this game, with B69 for Black to attach at 'a' to find ko threats is steady.];W[ae];B[eq]C[Zhou Ruiyang clearly can't make miracle and turn the game round, the following process is just a delay in time.];W[ac];B[ic]LB[jc:a]C[B73: Black should double up at 'a' instead.]
;W[dq];B[fp]C[The play following B75 is also worth study.];W[do];B[bp];W[dn];B[cm];W[fn];B[bq];W[el];B[dr];W[cr];B[fr];W[ds]
;B[er];W[cq];B[bj];W[nq]TR[fp][ep][eq][er][dr][fr]C[W90: At any rate, White should pincer-attack Black's several stones.];B[jq]C[B91: Black proceeds smoothly, White finally suffers a big defeat.];W[qn];B[np]C[In this crucial game, Gu Li dares play new moves, his courage is worth praising. However, Zhou Ruiyang doesn't give a play to his talent and shows a losing trend very early on, hope they will play a brilliant decisive game 3.]
