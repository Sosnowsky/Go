;W[qn];B[qp];W[op]LB[pj:a]C[After the shoulder-hit of W10, White elects to play at 'a', this sequence is new and fresh.];B[oq];W[pj];B[qh];W[mp]C[The jump of W14 is pre-planned when playing the shoulder-hit.];B[oh];W[nq];B[po];W[qi]
;B[rh];W[iq]C[Through W20, after White handles several stones on the right side lightly, White moves the focus to the lower side, but the several stones on the right side are always a burden in the future.];B[cn];W[bo]C[The knight's move of W22 prevents Black from entering the corner on the second line.];B[bn];W[ck];B[cp];W[cq];B[co];W[bq];B[ep]LB[do:a][dq:b]C[The clamp of B29 is a tight good move, next if White extends at 'a', then Black can cut at 'b', White is not easy to handle.]
;W[dq];B[en];W[do];B[fm]LB[el:a]C[B33: For Black to jump at 'a' would be better.];W[dn];B[dm];W[el];B[em];W[fp];B[jd]C[After Black grabs the big point at the top with B39, Black is better off in the game.];W[bl]
;B[cl];W[dj];B[db];W[hc]LB[cc:a][hd:b]C[W44: White has no other good choice but to invade, if answering at 'a', Black will play at 'b', Black's moyo at the top would be too big.];B[cc];W[ec];B[fb]C[The retreat of B47 is a good move, perhaps White has neglected it.];W[cd];B[gd];W[eb]C[The push of W50 is unnecessary at this time, reducing one of his own liberties.]
;B[ea];W[jc]C[W52: White starts to seek life.];B[kd];W[kc];B[ld];W[mb];B[nb];W[mc];B[md];W[id];B[ie];W[hd];B[he]
;W[ib]C[Through W64, although White has made life, but it is very restricted, and Black's outside becomes very thick, as for the result at the top, White is not successful.];B[hm]LB[eh:a][ej:b]C[B65: For Black to play at 'a' lightly is a chance, later on attaching at 'b' is very powerful.];W[fg]C[W66 is a good move.];B[ef];W[eg];B[hp]LB[io:a]C[B69: Black is unnecessary to invade that deep, for example, first capping 'a' to obtain sente, then attacking White on the right side.];W[fo]C[White counters with W70, Black's shape is thin and weak.];B[hq]
;W[gn]C[The situation becomes complex.];B[gm];W[ip];B[ir]LB[jr:a][io:b]C[Now if White answers at 'a', then Black will play hane at 'b', White doesn't have any good follow-up.];W[io]LB[jr:a];B[fq];W[eo];B[jr]LB[gr:a]C[With the extension, Black obviously thinks he already makes life completely, but that is not the case. Black should hang at 'a' in order to live cleanly.]
;W[jm];B[il];W[jl];B[ij];W[jk];B[hi];W[rq]C[When White probes with W86, ......];B[qo]LB[lr:a]C[...... if Black is conscious about the well-being in the lower left, with B87, Black can first jump to 'a', this is another chance.];W[rn];B[ro];W[kr]C[After being attached by W90, Black already can't live locally.]
;B[jq]LB[gr:a][gp:b][er:c]C[B91: Now Black should hang at 'a', then W 'b' and B 'c', it will become ko-alive.];W[hn];B[lr];W[kq];B[js];W[pn];B[oo];W[hs]C[Through W98, Black has been killed unconditionally, the situation has been turned around.];B[lq]
;W[kp];B[lp];W[ks];B[lo];W[on];B[nn];W[nm];B[mn];W[ko]C[Through W108, although Black captures three white stones in the exchange, but Black's loss is obvious.];B[ma]LB[lb:a]C[B109 is again miscalculation, thinking White can only draw back at 'a'.];W[la]C[The atari of W110 is a good move.]
;B[lc];W[kb];B[lb]C[Through B113, although Black gains locally, but after White obtains sente, ......];W[gf]C[...... White first peeps with W114, ];B[bd];W[be];B[ed];W[dl];B[cm];W[ki]C[Finally White gets to grab the key knight's move with W120, White's victory already can't be overturned.
