Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[Up to the game 6 of the 59th Japanese Honinbo title match, Honinbo Cho U is leading the challenger Yoda Norimoto by 3:2, thus, Yoda can only win this game in order to force a game 7.];W[dc];B[de];W[pp]C[The corner approach of B3 is positive.];B[cc]
;W[dp];B[oc];W[cb];B[cd];W[eb];B[ch];W[ee];B[ef];W[fe];B[dd];W[ed];B[fc];W[ec]C[Through W18, both sides are thick.]
;B[qn];W[nq];B[rp]C[The small knight's move of B21 puts importance on territory.];W[ql]C[W22 is a must move in modern Go.];B[qm]LB[qq:a][qo:b][ro:c]C[B23 is rare, if Black simply makes the diagonal at 'a', Black is worried that White will bump at 'b', Black blocks at 'c', White hanes and Black hanes out to counterattack and this will lead a ladder, but Black doesn't have any good place to put a ladder breaker.];W[pl];B[qq];W[jp]LB[om:a]C[With the extension of W26, White thinks he must get to play one out of two: the diagonal seal at 'a' and the extension in the upper right.]
;B[lq]C[With the invasion of B27, Black ruins White's plan.];W[lp];B[kp];W[kq];B[ko];W[lr]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.];B[jq];W[mq];B[kr];W[ro]LB[jr:a]C[W36 is a decisive move, preparing to start the ko at 'a'.];B[qo]
;W[jr];B[lq];W[qp];B[kq];W[rq]C[Through W42, it forms an exchange, it seems White gets a relatively big territory, but Black's thickness also can't be underestimated.];B[on]
(;W[no]LB[ph:a][op:b][oq:c][pq:d][sp:e][po:f][rr:g][ps:h]C[W44: White can consider to extend at 'a': if B 'b', then W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f', W21 and B 'g', if White strikes with W44 now, Black is not comfortable, if Black connects, then W 'h' (see var a).];B[op]C[W44: White wants to tie up two black groups, but forcing Black to play the good move of B45.];W[sp]LB[oo:a][po:b][nn:c]C[W46: If White pushes at 'a', after Black cuts and ataris at 'b', Black will cap at 'c', White's loss will outweigh his gain.]
;B[oo];W[oq];B[pi]C[Although W46 is a strong move, Black can also get to play the good forcing move with B49, Black's thickness puts a big pressure on White.];W[ln];B[nm];W[oj];B[pj];W[ok];B[ml];W[oi];B[ph];W[oh];B[pg]
;W[li];B[kl];W[cn];B[dr]LB[kd:a]C[B63: For Black to extend at 'a' is also a big point.];W[cq];B[fq];W[kd];B[mc];W[lc];B[md];W[kf];B[ck]C[Black is able to grab the last big point with B71, Black obviously thinks "he can control the situation".]
;W[iq]C[W72 is a game-deciding move. Generally speaking, if Black forms a territory here, Black would be optimistic.];B[fo];W[gp];B[ep];W[gq]C[After this move, the game was closed for the first day.];B[do];W[co];B[dq];W[cp];B[go];W[ho];B[jo]
;W[hr]LB[hn:a][ir:b][ip:c]C[W84: If White extends out at 'a', then Black will strike at 84, White connects at 'b', Black takes at 'c' in good order, White will form an inefficient shape.];B[hn];W[io];B[in];W[fr];B[ip];W[hp];B[js];W[ir];B[fm]
;W[lk];B[ll];W[bl];B[ig];W[ie];B[cl];W[jj];B[bm];W[en];B[eo];W[cr]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.];B[ff];W[gf]
;B[gg];W[ik];B[il];W[hl];B[pq];W[pr]C[	];B[ol];W[pk];B[hf];W[ge];B[gj]C[B113 and B117 are good moves.];W[jl]
;B[jm];W[im];B[mo]TR[ln]C[Through B121, Black captures the marked white stone just in time.];W[lb]C[W122 is very big. White gets to play here, White's situation takes a better turn. Therefore, before this move, Black should find a chance to hane at 122 first, after White blocks, Black ataris in sente to finish the exchange.];B[bn];W[bo];B[cs];W[bs];B[ds];W[es];B[eq]
;W[cm];B[bk];W[ar];B[bb];W[ba];B[ac]LB[hh:a]C[B135: Black fights back, there is a ko in the corner, which can effectively prevents White from peeping at 'a'.];W[ri];B[rh];W[oa];B[nb];W[na];B[ma]

;B[al];W[is];B[ks];W[er]LB[sk:a]C[W222 is the losing move! White should descend at 'a', White would win the game by half point.];B[ls];W[ms];B[sk]C[With the hane of B225, Black wins the game for sure, Cho U successfully defends his title!];W[sl]C[On July 3rd and 5th, Yoda Norimoto played the semi final and final game of Fujistu Cup, and lost the champion game on 5th by 1.5 points, and today in such an important game held on 8th and 9th, he missed the chance in the end to win this game, perhaps he didn't have enough time to adjust.];B[rl];W[sj];B[qi]
