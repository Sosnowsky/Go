Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[In the game 4 of best-of-7 Honinbo title match, Cho U stopped his consecutive defeats, before this game 5, it is difficult to guess whether he will start to counterattack or new Honinbo will be born.];W[dc];B[cp];W[pp];B[de]
;W[ce];B[cf];W[cd];B[fq]C[Black's sequence from B1 to B9 is well prepared, in LG Cup Cho U once used this opening against Yu Bin.];W[ck]C[As to this, White also must be well prepared, W10 evades Black's sharp point.];B[cm];W[df];B[oc];W[dg];B[jc];W[qi];B[dh]LB[nq:a][qn:b]C[B17: For Black to play at 'a' or 'b' is all common, the play in the game leads to a fierce fight, it is too early.]
;W[ek]C[The jump of W18 is a good move, Black is not easy to take tenuki here.];B[cg]C[Black's sequence following B19 seems unreasonable.];W[ch]LB[eh:a]C[W20: White can also play hane at 'a'.];B[dj]C[Although Black's sequence following B21 looks like the tempo of playing, in fact Black has no other choice but to play this way.];W[cl];B[bh];W[ci];B[cj];W[bf]LB[bi:a]C[The atari of W26 is good order, comparing with the simple turn at 'a', the difference is very big.

After this move, it is time for lunch break.]
;B[bg];W[bi];B[eg]LB[bj:a][ag:b]C[B29: Black is very difficult, if Black blocks at 'a' simply, White will capture at 'b'.];W[ef];B[ff];W[ee];B[fe];W[ed];B[bj];W[di]C[White pushes and pounds with W36, Black's wrap-up appears in tatters.]
;B[ei];W[eh];B[ai];W[dh];B[ej];W[dm];B[cn];W[fk];B[gi];W[ag]C[Through W46, White captures four stones, White establishes his superiority very early on.];B[hk];W[fm];B[qn]
;W[ql];B[hm]LB[en:a]C[The direction of B51 is wrong, Black should peep at 'a', not allowing White's big dragon to make life, this way there will be more variations.];W[fo];B[hp];W[do]C[W52 and W54: White takes chance to make life.];B[dp];W[co];B[bo];W[bp];B[bn];W[bq]
;B[cr];W[bk];B[br];W[dn];B[bm];W[ho]C[White still can attach out and counterattack with W66, Black's situation has further deteriorated.];B[io];W[hn];B[in];W[im];B[jm];W[il];B[hl]
;W[jl];B[kl];W[jk];B[gj]LB[ji:a][km:b][kk:c]C[B77: Black is painful to strengthen, if Black caps at 'a ' instead, White can cut and atari at 'b' or turn out at 'c', Black couldn't kill White's group on the left side.];W[gp]C[After this move, the game was close for the first day.];B[km];W[ji];B[iq];W[gm]
;B[if];W[kk]LB[hh:a][lj:b]C[W84 is slow! It overly puts emphasis on the tactic at 'a'. Black should stick the head out easily by playing at 'b'.];B[kf];W[nq]LB[mk:a]C[W86: White should reinforce in the center, jumping to 'a' is the vital point.];B[pi];W[qj];B[qp]C[With the sequence following B87 and B89, Black messes up the situation.];W[qq];B[po]
