(;SZ[19]EV[2nd Chunlan Cup round 2]RO[2]DT[1999-12-25]PC[Beijing, China]PB[Ma Xiaochun]BR[9p]PW[Lee Changho]WR[9p]KM[5.5]RE[B+R]C[Passionate Game at End of Century:
On 12/25/1999, Ma Xiaochun waited this victory for a long time. As two top-notch players in the world, Lee Changho had achieved 10 consecutive and 6 consecutive victories against Ma Xiaochun, it was a big weird phenomenon. They had played total 29 fierce games since 1991 Fujistu Cup, although Lee Changho led by 22 wins and 7 defeats and with winning percentage as high as 76%, Ma Xiaochun lost again and again but fought back tenaciously every single time, this was also a big scene in Go world at end of century. Although Lee Changho who was 11 years younger eventually will surpass Ma Xiaochun, but their every collision and intense show made Go world crazy, it was the most memorable scene at end of last century.

;W[cn];B[kq];W[nc];B[pf];W[qk]C[W8 , W10 and the following W18 to W22 are all new attempt of Lee 9p, the purpose is to seek variations.  Within a reasonable range, making some free choices is just the characteristic of modern Go.];B[qi];W[qn];B[po]LB[op:a]C[B13 is to seek efficiency. For Black to jump simply at 'a' appears insipid, although it can't be criticized.];W[pn];B[oo];W[nm]
;B[lo]C[B17: Black continues to achieve efficiency, it is inevitable.];W[qc];B[pc];W[pb];B[qd];W[ce];B[qb]C[W22: Since White takes tenuki, Black certainly will cut with B23.];W[jc]C[W24 again is a move to seek variations.];B[dm]C[Following B25, Black's strategy is to simply reduce White's development on the left side, the position of W24 is not appropriate (no better than two-space extension).];W[cm];B[dk]
;W[dl];B[el];W[cl];B[fj];W[fl]LB[eo:a]C[Undoubtedly, White's strategy is tit-for-tat against Black's, and the tight clamp of W32 is the best evidence. Please notice, with W32 White can't reinforce at the top, first, reinforcing himself already reduces efficiency, second, for Black to seal off by making knight's move at 'a' is very big.];B[ek]LB[em:a]C[B33: For Black to connect at 'a' is also playable, but there will be many variations, and it also basically contradicts with Black's fighting strategy: not tangling with White.];W[fn];B[em];W[eo]C[W36: Although White is painful, ...]
;B[dr];W[er];B[eq];W[cr]C[... but it is also the premise of W38 and W40, to protect the corner strongly.];B[dq];W[cq];B[hp]C[Through B43, Black strengthens bottom and lower-right corner naturally, and White also settles the shape in sente.];W[fh]C[W44: White blocks from sky (a good move strategically), both sides still play surrounding the future of White's top moyo and the position of W24.];B[hj];W[hh];B[db];W[cc]
;B[gc]C[When I played B49 which can be sacrificed or saved and saw Lee 9p meditating, I feel I'm leading, since the fighting field here is not where Lee 9p is good at.];W[id]C[W50: White perhaps has no other choice.];B[ec]C[Black hanes up with B51 and can fight adequately.];W[fb];B[eb];W[gb]C[The play W52 and W54 is inevitable, if Black lives unconditionally, the game will be instantly over.];B[cb];W[bb]C[W56: White must play hane here, not allowing Black make eyes, but ...];B[de];W[df];B[cf]C[..., this entices the tesujis of B57 and B59.]
;W[ee]C[The atari of W60 is a good move, any yield will lead to fast defeat. Now Black faces choice.];B[bc]C[After the cut of B61, the direction of game completely changes.];W[bd];B[dd];W[ac];B[ed]LB[ef:a]C[The simple connection of B65 is important. If Black cuts at 'a' to seek life, Black will be very dangerous.];W[ef];B[bf];W[ba]C[Both sides elect to descend, B67 and W68 are simple tesujis.];B[ch]
;W[hc]C[Through W70, it appears Black is being killed, in fact it is still a "X" factor, it is not over yet.];B[lc];W[qa];B[rb];W[md];B[ld];W[mb]C[W76: White aims to sacrifice.];B[lb];W[le];B[me]C[B79: But Black instead plays by sacrificing, this is also the brilliant point in the war at the top.];W[mc]C[W80: White can only play like this.]
;B[gd]C[After leaving all the aji, Black extends out with B81, this is just the eventual goal of Black's strategy.];W[be]C[W82: White can only make life, otherwise White's liberty is short in the capturing race.];B[he];W[ke]C[W84: White has no alternative but to strengthen.];B[hg]C[B85: Black borrows strength to escape. As a result, Black's big dragon comes alive again, Black's situation is clearly favorable.];W[gg];B[ig];W[ih];B[jg];W[jh];B[kg]

;B[ck]C[After Black blocks with B105, I know,  no matter what happens, Black will win.];W[nq];B[pa];W[gf];B[ie];W[kd];B[lj]LB[on:a]C[B111: Black is not precise and careful enough, Black should take chance to push at 'a'.];W[lk];B[ki];W[ji];B[li]

;B[km];W[jl];B[kl];W[kk];B[on]LB[no:a]C[B133: When Black pushes now, White ignores it, if B133 is omitted, White can attach at 'a'.];W[oj];B[nj];W[pk];B[om];W[nl];B[og];W[gk]

;B[dh]C[B167 is a valuable move in terms of both shape and point, and this is originally White's privilege. Before I played it, Lee 9p almost tried to play there several times. After B167, White perhaps already has no mind to continue fight.];W[lf]C[W168 is the move White elects to play after deciding to concede defeat in the middle game.];B[eg];W[nh];B[ge])
