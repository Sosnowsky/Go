;W[kq];B[ip];W[pr];B[qq];W[np]C[Through the tiger's move of W22, White has achieved his original plan.];B[fc];W[hc];B[kp];W[lq]LB[lo:a]C[The effectiveness with the exchange of B25 and W26 is unclear, if Black doesn't exchange, later on White's turn at 25 is very big, but after the exchange, Black loses the chance of making the knight's move at 'a'.];B[cc];W[dc]
;B[cd];W[de];B[db];W[eb];B[cb];W[ec];B[cf];W[kc];B[qf];W[ch]C[The forcing move of W38 makes Black a little painful.];B[df];W[ef];B[eg]
;W[ff];B[id]C[B43 is an asking move.];W[ke]LB[ic:a]C[W44: White seems to have fallen into a trap, in fact White should simply block at 'a', Black doesn't have any special follow-up tactic.]
(;B[fb]LB[ic:a][ib:b][gb:c][ea:d][fd:e][ce:f]C[B45 is wrong order, Black should first block at 'a', after W 'b', then descend with B45, this way White can only hang at 'c', followed by B 'd' and W 'e', next B 'f' is sente, Black would have taken advantage (see var a). In the game Black is dangerous.];W[fa];B[ga];W[ea];B[ic];W[hb];B[ib]

(;W[dg]LB[ce:a][be:b][jf:c][gg:d][cg:e][hh:f][dh:g][fg:h]C[W66: White is not careful and precise enough, White should first push at 'a', then B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W66, B 'e', W 'f', B 'g' and W 'h', this would be better than the real game (see var a). Here Black didn't gain anything in the exchange but Black gets out of trouble.];B[cg];W[jf];B[dh];W[gh];B[mc]
;W[kb];B[cl];W[cr];B[pj];W[om];B[oc];W[pl]C[B77 and W78 are equally big points.];B[qr];W[qg]C[The attachment of W80 is a good move! Black doesn't have any strong maneuver.];B[pf];W[rf];B[re]
;W[rh];B[qi]LB[sf:a][rd:b]C[B85: The original move is to atari at 'a', in the game after being clamped by White at 'b', Black is painful.];W[rd];B[qe];W[ph];B[oi];W[oh];B[nh];W[ng]LB[ni:a][qj:b]C[However the hane of W92 is the losing move! After Black connects at 'a', White's big group is very dangerous. White should squeeze at 'b', this way Black already can't kill White.]

White can only play at 'a', followed by B 'b', W 'c', B 'd' and W 'e'. Now because White can extend liberties at 'f', Black can't connect at 'g' allowing White to cut in sente, Black can only attach at 'h'. If White cuts at 'g', then B 'i', W 'j', B 'k', W 'l', B 'g', W106, B 'm', White would live in gote (see var a). But Black's hane at 'n' will create a ko, White is not good either; If White makes the knight's move at 106 instead, then B 'o', W 'p', B 'g', W 'q' and B 'r', it is ko-killing, it seems Black is no bad either, but at least the outcome of the game would be still hard to imagine (see var b).]
