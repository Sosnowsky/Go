Translation:GoGameWorld.];B[qd]C[In the final of the 4th Liguang Cup, Chang Hao 9p defeated Liu Xing 6p by resignation and won the champion. However, Liu Xing advanced to the finals of this event in 2003 and 2004 but all ended in the second place, it is somewhat pitiful.];W[dc];B[pp];W[dp];B[de]
;W[oc];B[fd];W[nq];B[qn];W[pm]C[The shoulder-hit of W10 is Liu Xing's favorite play.];B[qm];W[pf];B[eb];W[pd];B[qe];W[qc];B[rc];W[qb]
;B[rg]LB[qg:a]C[B19 is not good, Black should jump to 'a', this would be better than the real game.
];W[be];B[cd];W[ci];B[cn]LB[pe:a][oe:b][of:c]C[The direction of B23 is not right, Black should push at 'a', then W 'b' and B 'c', Black is not afraid of fight.];W[gb];B[cc];W[cl]
;B[cq];W[cp];B[dq];W[ep];B[bp];W[bo];B[bq];W[co];B[fq];W[ph]C[After White jumps with W36, White is favorable for the game.];B[qh];W[pi];B[kd]
;W[ri];B[rb];W[ra];B[qi];W[qj];B[rh];W[ql]LB[rk:a]C[The hane of W46 is a very early questionable move! White should directly hang at 'a', Black can only make life as in the game.];B[oq];W[np];B[pn];W[om];B[no]C[In the game, White incurs a big loss with the exchange of W46 for the sequence from B47 to B51.]
;W[rk];B[pe];W[oe];B[qf];W[of];B[hc]C[The strengthening move of B57 can't be ignored, otherwise if White pulls out here, Black can't tolerate.];W[nr];B[or];W[hq]LB[jq:a]C[With W60, White overly chases efficiency, making an extension at 'a' is not bad at all.];B[fp];W[fo]
;B[go];W[fn];B[jq]C[After B61 and B63, the invasion of B65 is severe!];W[sb];B[si];W[rj];B[re];W[sc];B[sf];W[mo];B[nn];W[mn];B[nm]
;W[mm]TR[jq]LB[gp:a]C[Black already has no other choice but to attach three times in a row with W72, W74 and W76 then cut at 'a'. Because Black is already leading in territory, White has to attack the marked black stone in order to redeem his loss.];B[nl];W[gp];B[fr];W[hp];B[jo];W[kp];B[iq];W[hr];B[ko];W[kq]
;B[kr];W[io];B[jp];W[lr];B[jm];W[ml];B[in];W[hn];B[hm];W[gm];B[hl]C[Through B97, although Black is basically stable, but White already achieves his goal.];W[gj];B[hj]
;W[hi]LB[kb:a][jc:b][gk:c][lc:d]C[W98 and W100 are far-fetched, this is also the first step that leads to White's defeat! With W98, White should make the great knight's move at 'a', then Black makes the diagonal extension at 'b' and White jumps to 'c', this way White's situation is not bad. In the game, Black destroys White's potential with B99 in sente, then takes tenuki and makes diagonal at 'd', the situation becomes very close.];B[gk];W[ij];B[fj];W[gi];B[ek];W[dj];B[fi];W[fl]
;B[fk];W[gg];B[fh];W[if];B[lc];W[gd];B[gc];W[fe]LB[cf:a]C[With the sequence following W114 and W116, White loses his senses! If White makes a small diagonal at 'a', this would be still a very long game.];B[hd];W[fg];B[dh];W[df]
;B[ch]C[In the game, Black blocks in sente with B121 then makes life, White clearly incurs a loss.

;W[lq];B[lo];W[gs]LB[mp:a]C[In an inferior situation, W136 is the last losing move! White can only connect at 'a', this way White would probably have a chance of winning.];B[mp];W[fs]LB[ir:a]C[When White crawls with W138, Black captures at 'a', this is simple and clear, this way Black has full assurance of success.];B[ir]LB[dr:a]TR[gs]C[However, B139 should be played at 'a' to make life, this way the marked white stone becomes dame, how White wins the game?];W[ds]C[After W140, although White puts a desperate fight, but the difference is too big, White can only concede defeat in the middle game.]
