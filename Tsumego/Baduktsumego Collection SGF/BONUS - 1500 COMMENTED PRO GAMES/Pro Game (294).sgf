Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[pd]C[This three country ring contest comes down to the final decisive game, Chinese key player Rui Naiwei 9p takes Black against Korean key player Park JiEun 5p.];W[dd];B[qp];W[dq];B[oq]
;W[qj]C[The opening from B1 to W6 is often used by Rui Naiwei 9p.];B[dn]C[The two-space high approach of B7 is a typical move of Teacher Go Seigen's 21st century Go.];W[co];B[cf];W[fc];B[bd];W[cc];B[ci];W[cn]C[Through W14, it is a sample opening of Teacher Go Seigen.];B[ql];W[qf];B[qh]
;W[of];B[nc];W[rd];B[pi];W[qc];B[kc];W[pj];B[ni];W[oj];B[ng]C[The sequence from B15 to B27 is also a common joseki in Korean Go games, this means Rui 9p wants to defeat her opponent with the most familiar tactic.];W[pl]C[After the attachment of W28, the situation starts to vary.];B[qm]LB[pm:a][om:b]C[B29: If Black hanes at 'a', then White will hane at 'b', this will be relatively intense. In the game, Black retreats at 29, the situation is relatively mild.]
;W[mk];B[eq];W[dp]LB[ep:a][fp:b]TR[dn]C[W32 is a steady move, if White hanes at 'a', then Black will counter-hane at 'b', the earlier marked black stone will be put into use.];B[ip]C[Black grabs the big points of B31 and B33, Black's tempo is fast.];W[ld];B[lc];W[nd]C[W34 and W36 are good order.];B[mc];W[nf]
;B[mg];W[kk];B[jh];W[kq]C[With the invasion of W42, White tries to keep balance in territory, making Black feel pressure of giving komi.];B[ko]C[With the sequence following B43, Black takes influence, Black seems to have assurance of success.];W[ir];B[hq];W[hr];B[gq];W[mq];B[mo];W[or]
;B[nr]LB[pr:a][ik:b]C[B51: Black should simply hane at 'a', White retreats at 51, Black gets to cap at 'b', strongly attacking White's big dragon.];W[nq];B[pr];W[op];B[pq];W[mr]LB[no:a]C[W56: If White hangs at 'a', Black will grab eye shape in sente by playing at 56, White's connection at the top is also questionable.];B[on]C[B57 is thick.];W[ik]C[W58: White gets to stick the head out, White appears smooth.]
;B[hc];W[bc];B[os]C[Black's aji is not bad after taking one stone with B61, but regrettably Black ends in gote.];W[lp];B[lo];W[ck]C[White grabs the last big point with W64, White is leading in the game.];B[pc];W[oi];B[oh];W[pg];B[ph];W[lf]C[W70 is a severe mistake, getting herself into trouble in a place where she shouldn't play]
;B[mf];W[me];B[qb]LB[rb:a][qd:b][oe:c][re:d]C[After Black pushes with B71, White shows cut points, Black hanes with B73, if White blocks at 'a', Black ataris at 'b', after Black's small diagonal extension at 'c', the hane at 'd' will work.];W[jd]C[White sees Black's tactic, with W74 White suddenly loses calmness.];B[qd]C[After the atari of B75, White loses a big territory and eye shape, White instantly sinks into a crisis.];W[jc];B[jj];W[jk]
;B[lj]C[B77 and B79 are good moves.];W[lk];B[kd]C[Black pushes again with B81, what White can do?];W[ke];B[je];W[jf];B[ie];W[kh]C[White has no other choice but to play W86.];B[kg]LB[li:a][if:b][he:c]C[B87 is soft-hearted, if Black doubles up at 'a', W 'b', then Black can extend at 'c', this way White can't continue the game any more.]
;W[lg];B[lh];W[ki];B[kj];W[li];B[mh];W[jg];B[ji];W[kf];B[mj];W[he];B[id];W[hi]
;B[hh];W[if];B[hj];W[ij];B[ii];W[gi];B[gh];W[gj];B[fh];W[hg]C[W110 is a game-deciding move, eyeing for Black's cut points.];B[gc];W[ih]C[W112 throwing in the ko immediately is perhaps a little hasty, but its timing is also hard to control.]
;B[ig];W[gd];B[fb];W[ih];B[rh];W[fd];B[eb];W[dg];B[ei];W[cg];B[dk];W[dl];B[ek]
;W[gl];B[el];W[dm];B[cl];W[cm];B[bl];W[bk];B[cj];W[rf];B[ig];W[gb]C[When White plays the ko threat of W136, Black should directly atari on the second line, White would have one less ko threat.];B[ic];W[ih]

;B[ig];W[pm];B[ih];W[bh]LB[bg:a]C[Through B167, Black wins the ko fight, White has to reinforce with W168, otherwise Black can cross over by playing hane at 'a'.];B[rn]LB[jq:a]C[B169 is a mistake, Black should first strengthen the cut in sente at 'a', then connect back two stones with B169.];W[jp];B[jo];W[io]C[W170 and W172 are fierce and good moves.];B[jq]
;W[kp];B[jr];W[iq];B[hp];W[hd];B[ha];W[gr]LB[in:a][fm:b][fn:c]C[W180: White should simply extend at 'a', next B 'b' and W 'c', Black is difficult to connect.];B[kr];W[js];B[mp]
;W[lq];B[fp];W[in];B[fm];W[po];B[pp];W[ks];B[np];W[gn];B[fn];W[go];B[fo];W[bm]C[White captures two stones with W196, now the game becomes close.]
;B[gf];W[hf];B[ef];W[eg];B[fg];W[df];B[ee]LB[dc:a]C[When B203, White can only play at 'a'.];W[db]C[White perhaps is not careless, W204 is a big mistake.];B[de]C[After Black pushes with B205, the curtain of this three country's ring contest comes to a close dramatically.

Rui Naiwei wins by resignation, Chinese Team wins the champion of this ring contest.])
