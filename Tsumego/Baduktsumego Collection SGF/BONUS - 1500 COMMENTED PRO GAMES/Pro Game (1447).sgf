;W[hq];B[cf];W[fc];B[bd]C[Through B9, it is a very common opening.];W[qo];B[pl];W[op]LB[oq:a]C[When White presses with the knight's move of W12, Black has no state of mind to crawl at 'a'.];B[pp];W[po];B[oo];W[pm]
;B[no];W[om]TR[hq]LB[ql:a]C[Through W18, due to the existence of the marked white stone, Black dare not descend at 'a' to start a fight.];B[mq];W[ql]TR[fq][hq]C[Through W20, locally White is very happy, but due to the early exchange of the marked white and black stone, on the whole board Black also looks acceptable.];B[cc];W[nc];B[qf];W[pb]

;W[kp];B[kq];W[lr];B[mr];W[kr];B[lo]C[Here Black's play is a little weak, through B43, White clearly gains.];W[qb]C[W44 is fierce and relentless.];B[gq];W[gp];B[hp]C[With B45 and B47, Wang Lei starts to exert power, but it seems already too late.];W[hr]C[After the descent of W48, Black is very difficult to gain a big profit. So far, I think Black is in a bitter battle.

After this move, it is time for noon break.]
