(;SZ[19]EV[7th Samsung Cup round 2]PC[Korea]DT[2002-08-30]KM[6.5]PB[Lee Changho]BR[9p]PW[Hu Yaoyu]WR[7p]RE[W+R]C[Commentary: Hu Yaoyu 7p, Copyright by gogameworld.com and weiqi.tom.com];B[pd];W[dd];B[qp];W[dq]C[I'm luckier this time, in Round 1, my opponent was Park SungMoon, a weaker 4p player, I've never won a game in international competitions, after winning the first game, I feel relaxed a little. Also I defeated Lee once several months ago, so I am very relieved and played a very good game. On the other hand, Lee was a bit nervous and made several mistakes, and eventually lost the game by resignation.]
;B[oq];W[co];B[pj];W[jd]LB[nc:a][jp:b]C[The game becomes a moyo fight, W8 is not helpful to make territory, the normal move is the corner approach at 'a', but White got chance to play the big point at 'b' and White's opening is much faster.];B[lc];W[le];B[nc];W[jp];B[fc]LB[ci:a]C[The normal play for B13 at 'a' to control White's framework, B13 has chosen the wrong direction, but the following B15 and B17 are very good moves.]
;W[fe]TR[jd][le]C[W14 is good idea, and it has a nice relationship with the two marked stones.];B[dj];W[ch];B[kd];W[ke];B[je];W[id];B[jf];W[he]C[Due to exchange of B13 and W14, White has to enforce his group with W22.];B[cc]LB[kg:a]C[B23 is a typical move for Lee's style, he prefers territory. Diagonal move at 'a' is very initiative, but the future moves are not so clear.]
;W[md];B[mc];W[kg];B[cd];W[jg]TR[pj]C[Through 28, Black got a huge territory on the upper right, but White also become very thick in the center, B7's position is apparently not good, so at this time it's hard to say who is better.];B[dm];W[mq];B[hq];W[iq];B[ir]LB[io:a][en:b][jo:c]C[B33 is one move that Lee regrets, it should be played at 'a' to jump to the center lightly. Then if White make a knight move at 'b', Black can push at 'c', this is hard for White, because Black has the advantage in territory. B33 made Black's group heavier.]
;W[hp];B[gp];W[gq];B[hr];W[go];B[fp];W[fq];B[ep];W[eq];B[kq];W[pq]C[W44 is a good asking move ! Black has no good answer.];B[pr]LB[pp:a][or:b][nq:c][nr:d][lp:e]C[It's painful for Black to crawl on the second line, B45 should block at 'a', followed by W 'b', B 'c', W 'd' and Black's diagonal move at 'e', this sequence is much better for Black.]
;W[kp];B[lq];W[lp];B[mr];W[nq];B[nr];W[op];B[or];W[on];B[en]LB[qe:a]C[B55 is not urgent! now Black and White are almost even in territory, it's much better for Black not to worry about left two stones and instead take a diagonal move at 'a' to make sure his leading in territory.];W[re];B[qd]
;W[qh]C[W56 and W58 reduced Black's potential in sente, Black is not favorable anymore in territory.];B[qm];W[jr];B[ri];W[rh];B[qi];W[oh];B[gn]LB[jq:a]TR[en]C[B65 has no choice, if it was played at 'a' to take the territory, the left side will get severely attacked, earlier B55 becomes a heavy move.];W[ip];B[de]C[B67 chose to take the territory.]
;W[cl]C[W68 is severe ! Black's in trouble.];B[dl];W[ck];B[dk];W[cj];B[cm];W[di];B[ei];W[eh];B[fi];W[gl];B[cf];W[fh]
;B[hj];W[hn];B[gh]LB[gm:a][hm:b][fl:c][hl:d][fk:e]C[B83 is the last mistake ! now the only choice is push at 'a', followed by W 'b', B 'c', W 'd' and B 'e', it will be a easy game for White, but the game is still too early.];W[gi]C[W84 cut is crucial, Black's shape suddenly collapes.];B[gj];W[hi];B[gg];W[ii]
;B[bi];W[dh]TR[gh][gg]C[The two marked stones have no way to escape. It may be a miscalculation starting from B83.];B[bh];W[ci];B[gm];W[fj];B[ej];W[fk];B[hm];W[ij];B[do]
;W[cp];B[il];W[hk];B[fo]C[Through 103, Black lost too much in the fight and it's painful to live in gote.];W[qn]C[White get the chance to play at 104, the game is over, there is no chance for Black.];B[rn];W[qo];B[ro];W[qq];B[np];W[rp];B[mp]

;W[om];B[oi];W[og];B[po]C[B141 is the last challenging move.];W[pp];B[oo];W[pn];B[lm];W[rr];B[sq];W[ln];B[mn];W[ll]
;B[km];W[kl];B[jl];W[lj];B[ml];W[jm];B[kn];W[in]LB[lo:a][fm:b]C[If Black take one stone with 'a' and kill White's dragon on the right side, White will play at 'b' to kill Black's dragon on the left side.])
