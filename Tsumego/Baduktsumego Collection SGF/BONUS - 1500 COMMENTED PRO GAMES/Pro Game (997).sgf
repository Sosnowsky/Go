;B[en];W[ep];B[dn]LB[dm:a][fn:b]C[B9 at 'a' or 'b' is also possible.];W[cp];B[gn];W[hp]C[Through 12, it is a common variation.];B[de];W[cg];B[cc];W[cd]
;B[dd];W[ce];B[cf];W[bf];B[df]LB[ec:a][db:b]C[The usual sequence is B21 at 'a', W 'b', then B21 connects, But Black worries that White may take at 21 in reply to 'a', though White has some loss locally, but from whole board's configuration, White can fight.];W[bd]LB[ec:a][bg:b]C[W22 is the proper move, if White extends to 'a', B 'b' will cut, giving play to Black's thickness in the lower left.];B[ec];W[db]
;B[dg];W[ch];B[eb];W[cb];B[ic]C[Through 29, it is a basic joseki.];W[qf];B[ph];W[qc]LB[of:a]C[W32 opts for territory, jumping at 'a' is also possible.];B[pc];W[qd];B[pe]
;W[pf]LB[qe:a]C[W36 is a planned move, if connecting at 'a', then B 36, Black is very thick, White is not satisfied.];B[qe];W[re];B[rd];W[rc];B[rf];W[sd];B[rg]LB[of:a]C[B43 can also be played as the hane at 'a', but Black's outside thickness is clearly no good, the play in the game is strong and tough.];W[nf];B[md]
;W[lf];B[nh]LB[of:a]C[B47 is a good point for attack, and also aims to wedge at 'a'.];W[nd];B[qb]LB[nc:a][mc:b][ld:c][oc:d][nb:e][pb:f]C[If B49 blocks at 'a' directly, then W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 'e', W 'f', Black gets captured.];W[mc]LB[rb:a][nc:b]C[If W50 at 'a', then Black can hane at 'b', White's earlier maneuver is not effective any more.]
;B[of]LB[rb:a]C[If B51 kills at 'a', then White has many uses for other purposes on the outside,  it is not to Black's advantage.];W[kc]C[Through 52, an exchange develops, both sides have some gains.];B[jq];W[io];B[mp];W[qq]LB[qp:a]C[If W56 is left unplayed, Black can double up at 'a', the efficacy of Black stones is extremely high.];B[qp];W[pq];B[nq]LB[oq:a]C[B59 is better than the hane at 'a'.]
;W[nr];B[mr];W[rp];B[ro];W[rq];B[or]LB[qo:a][rn:b][qn:c][qm:d]C[B65 is violent and ruthless, if White cuts at 'a', B 'b' extends, W 'c', B 'd' hanes, because Black is favorable in the ladder, White is no good.];W[fd]LB[ed:a][qo:b]C[W66 also serves as a ladder breaker, if Black connects, the cut of W 'b' will work.]
;B[bc];W[bb];B[op]C[B69 is very substantial.];W[hd];B[ge]C[B71 is a good sequence play.];W[gd];B[ed];W[gb]C[Through 74, it is White's deserved compensation.];B[fe];W[ei];B[gh];W[hm]
;B[dp];W[cq];B[ck];W[dl];B[gm];W[cl]C[So far, it is time for lunch break.];B[fj];W[ej];B[if];W[id];B[hl]C[After 89, Black is basically stable, White's attack is not successful.];W[pr]
;B[sp];W[ok];B[qk];W[rb]C[The value of W94 is worth more than 20 points.];B[ne];W[me];B[mk];W[nj];B[oe]LB[mj:a][og:b][ng:c][pg:d][oh:e]C[If B99 presses at 'a', then W 'b', B 99, W 'c', B 'd' and W 'e', Black is no good.]
;W[mj];B[ld];W[kd];B[lk];W[mh]LB[ql:a]C[W104 should first probe Black at 'a' before settling the shape in the upper right.];B[le];W[ke];B[mf];W[lg];B[bn];W[bl];B[ol]C[B111 is strong, White is not optimistic.]
;W[ih]LB[kf:a]C[W112 also guards against the cut 'a'.];B[dh];W[di];B[ek];W[dk];B[hn]C[B117 is a safe and steady play under a favorable situation.];W[eh];B[fg];W[pk];B[pl];W[qj]
;B[rk];W[rj];B[nk];W[oj];B[pi];W[pj]C[Through 128, Black's advantage is clear.];B[ki];W[jg];B[rm]LB[kf:a][jf:b][lh:c]C[B131 stengthens and also leads to the tactic of Black's cut at 'a', W 'b' and Black's  sequeezing at 'c'.]
;W[mg];B[fq]C[After B133, White concedes defeat. The final game 3 will on 2/6/2003.])
