Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[Black is Lee Chang Ho 9P Korea];W[pp]C[White is Kong Jie 7P of China];B[dd]C[In this game, the situation is always very tight. Although at one time Lee Changho's situation was once not bad, but there is no clear chance of winning either. Perhaps just under this pressure, in critical moments, Lee Changho made several mistakes.];W[dp]
;B[qn];W[ql];B[oc];W[pn];B[po];W[qo]LB[oo:a]C[White elects to take territory with W10, which is the strategy against Lee Changho's style. Taking influence by playing at 'a' is also very good.];B[oo];W[on];B[qp];W[ro];B[nn];W[nm]
;B[no];W[qq];B[mm]LB[om:a]C[B19: For Black to play at 'a' would lead to a fierce fight, which is not what Lee Changho is good at.];W[nl];B[ml];W[nk];B[mk];W[nj];B[mj];W[ni];B[qg];W[cn]LB[jp:a]C[W28 is interesting, normally White will play at 'a' to contain the  development of Black's influence.]
;B[qj];W[qk]LB[rp:a]C[W30: For White to play at 'a' is relatively better, this way Black's potential at the bottom will be constrained.];B[rk];W[pj];B[qi];W[rl];B[ip];W[oq];B[mq];W[cf];B[fd]TR[ni]LB[fc:a]C[B39 at 'a' is better, because at the top White has the iron head of the marked stone, Black's moyo at the top is hard to expand.]
;W[bd];B[cc];W[dh];B[jc];W[gp];B[cj];W[ci];B[bi]LB[ej:a]C[B47: Black should play at 'a'.];W[dj];B[ch];W[di];B[cg]
;W[dg];B[ck];W[bj];B[bk];W[bh];B[aj];W[bf];B[bm]LB[hc:a]C[The set pattern up to B59 makes White's invasion at 'a' effective, Black is a little damaging.

After this move, it is time for noon break.];W[iq];B[jq];W[hq];B[jr]
;W[hc];B[id]C[Since there is no way to retreat, Black has to kill White strongly with B65! The variation here is very complicated.];W[gd];B[ge];W[fc];B[ed];W[hd]LB[eb:a]C[W70 perhaps is miscalculation, making the diagonal at 'a' is the strongest move! This way Black also can't capture White, Black's outside influence wouldn't be that thick as in the real game.];B[he];W[ib];B[gb];W[jb]
;B[kb];W[fb];B[eb];W[ga];B[ha];W[kc];B[kd];W[lc];B[lb];W[mb];B[mc];W[ld];B[nb]
;W[ie]LB[fa:a][hb:b][if:c][ke:d]C[W88: White has no choice but to give up some stones, if White connects at 'a', after B 'b', White plays at 88, Black can atari at 'c', when White initiates the ko at 'd', because the exchange of W 'a' and B 'b' is very damaging, White wouldn't be able to win this ko.];B[je];W[if];B[jf];W[fa];B[ff]LB[hb:a][fe:b]C[B93: If Black tries to kill White by playing at 'a', White will cut at 'b', Black's liberty is not enough.];W[hb]
;B[ig]C[Through B95, White incurs some loss. Both sides play peacefully, Black can be satisfied.];W[bn];B[fq]C[B97 is the strongest move! This is also White's weak point in this shape, Lee Changho's feeling is indeed sharp!];W[fp];B[dq];W[cq];B[eq];W[cr];B[ep];W[eo];B[hr];W[ir]
;B[gr]LB[do:a]C[But B107 is too strong and unreasonable, although to atari at 'a' is a little damaging, but Black can guarantee to safely cross over with B107.];W[jp]C[W108: White is forced to counterattack.];B[do];W[kp];B[cp];W[bp];B[kq];W[js]LB[is:a]C[W114 is weak! If standing at 'a', Black will lose the tactic of making life on the left side, Black would be very dangerous! Perhaps Kong Jie has a favorable consciousness, but now the situation is still chaotic, one small mistake or weakness probably can change the outcome of the game, White shouldn't give way.];B[lp]
;W[io];B[en]LB[dn:a]C[B117 is a crude move, Black should directly play at 'a'.];W[fo];B[dn];W[cm];B[jn];W[hm];B[jo];W[ko];B[kn];W[lo];B[ln]
;W[mo];B[mp];W[hp];B[mn];W[ip];B[lr];W[fl]LB[co:a][ng:b]C[W134: White should first atari at 'a', this way White has the chance of grabbing the point 'b', White is not bad.];B[el];W[fm];B[ng]C[B137 is huge! Lee Changho takes the initiative, but afterwards, his play is below the standard.]
;W[co];B[cl];W[dp];B[an]LB[hs:a]C[B141 is over relentless! By making life at 'a', Black is already favorable for the game.];W[ao];B[am];W[is];B[cp];W[al];B[bl];W[dp];B[hs]
;W[fs];B[cp];W[ee];B[fe];W[dp];B[rp]LB[ah:a][ma:b][dm:c]C[The following ko fight is complicated, Black has made two mistakes, one, with B155 Black should first play the small ko threat at 'a', when W 'b', Black can use big ko threats for example at 155 to make White collapse by playing at 'c', ...];W[rq];B[cp];W[ic];B[jd]
;W[dp];B[op];W[sp];B[cp];W[ma];B[na]C[..., two, with B165, Black should eliminate the ko, the game is to Black's advantage.];W[dp];B[om];W[pm];B[cp];W[hg];B[hf];W[dp]
