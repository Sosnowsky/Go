;B[cf];W[cd];B[fq];W[cn];B[df];W[fc];B[cj];W[dr]C[W14 is slow.];B[qn];W[jq];B[lq];W[jo];B[lo]
;W[qj];B[qh];W[oj];B[oh];W[mj]C[White's sequence from W20 to W24 is even harder to understand, it seems Lee Sedol wants to try all kinds of variations.];B[hq];W[hn];B[jr]C[Black makes one-space extension with B25, then attaches over with B27, for now White doesn't have any good follow-up tactic.];W[oc]C[W28: White has no choice but to grab the big point by approaching the corner.
];B[mh]C[As to this, Black jumps with B29 to put more emphasis on the center, it is a good move. So far, White is already falling behind in the opening.];W[on]
;B[kq];W[qo];B[po];W[pn];B[qp];W[qm];B[ro];W[rn]LB[kc:a]C[When W30, Black takes tenuki and strengthens the corner with B31, it is a calm and good move, White has no follow-up, but at any rate, White's set pattern from W32 to W38 is a big wrong strategy! At least White should take tenuki and play at around 'a' first.];B[mc]C[In the game, Black again takes action first with B39, White already is difficult to redeem his inferior situation.];W[oe];B[pc]
;W[pb];B[qb];W[pd];B[qc];W[qe];B[re];W[kc]LB[rf:a]C[As to Black's attack from W40 to B47, White is left with the hane at 'a' to initiate ko, then White pincers with W48, White handles beautifully.];B[me];W[ke]LB[ch:a][rf:b]C[W50: White can only invade at 'a', after creating ko threats, White can fight for a victory by playing hane at 'b', although it may be still far-fetched, but as to White, this is the only chance.]
;B[nd]C[But next White jumps with W50, Black peeps with B51, White instantly has no follow-up, so far, we can say the game is already over.];W[gf];B[cl];W[ng];B[nh];W[od];B[pf]LB[rf:a]C[W54 and W56: White can only play at 'a' to obtain some profit, B57 is a good move!];W[fi];B[eg];W[qf];B[rf]

;W[ho];B[fp];W[dj];B[ci];W[kn]C[Next B89 is really unnecessary, only if Black strengthens the cut at 92, Black already wins big.];B[ln];W[lm];B[ff];W[gg];B[ge];W[gd];B[ed];W[ec]

;W[hi];B[ek];W[gq]C[White encloses the center, White gets to push down with W116 and gains a big profit, but since the difference in the first half is too big, White still ends with a loss.];B[bk];W[dm];B[fm];W[ir];B[hr];W[gr];B[jp];W[hk];B[fo];W[hs]

;W[eo];B[fd];W[qg];B[rg]C[Overall, Lee Sedol doesn't give a play to his talent in this game. Recently, Lee Sedol loses very often in Korean national tournaments, it is not so weird, the question is, who can stop him in international tournaments?])
