Translation:GoGameWorld.];B[pd]C[Black is Lee Changho 9p.];W[dd]C[White is O Rissei 9p.];B[qp]C[For the first time in history, there is no Chinese player in the quarter final of the 16th Fujitsu Cup! Perhaps it is God's will, because the quarter final was scheduled to take place in China and it was a problem due to the SARS desease, so it became easier to change the location. Here I will introduce the game between Lee Changho 9p and O Rissei 9p, in which Lee 9p taking Black won by 4.5 points. This is also the fifth time they play either other, Lee Changho won all the first four games, so it is understandable that O Rissei wants to revenge.];W[dp]
;B[nq]C[B1, B3 and B5 are popular plays nowadays.];W[qj];B[qk]C[The attachment of B7 is a novel play, Korean players specially like to play attachments.];W[pk];B[ql];W[pj];B[qf];W[pl];B[pm];W[qo]C[W14: With the attachment, White seeks variation.];B[ro];W[po]
;B[rq];W[om];B[qm];W[no]C[Through W20, the result is about equal, but Black takes sente and should have nothing to complain.];B[cf];W[fd];B[cj];W[cn];B[jd]C[B21-B25: Black aims at speed.];W[ch];B[bh];W[pb]C[After W28, White lives in the corner with sente and can be satisfied.]
;B[oc];W[ob];B[mc];W[qd];B[qe];W[rd];B[nb];W[rn]LB[oq:a][pr:b]C[W36: White should first attach at 'a', if Black still tenuki as in the game, later on White can turn at 'b', it will make a big difference from the real game.];B[qn];W[so];B[rp]
;W[rk];B[rm];W[oq];B[or];W[pq];B[kq];W[nh];B[hq];W[kp];B[lq];W[id]C[Black is already thick, so with W50, White wants to take advantage in sente.];B[ic];W[hc]
;B[jc];W[pc];B[od];W[bi]C[W56: At this juncture, it is urgent for White to play a hane at 56 to initiate a fight.];B[ci];W[bg];B[dh];W[cg];B[dg];W[bf];B[ce];W[cd];B[be]
;W[df];B[nm]C[The clamp of B67 serves as a ladder-breaker.];W[on]LB[pn:a][ol:b]C[W68: Because W 'a' is sente, so it is better for White to connect at 'b', this clever move can be reflected in the following fight.];B[de];W[ef];B[ee];W[fe];B[bd];W[bc];B[ed]
;W[ec];B[dc];W[cc];B[fc];W[eb];B[ff];W[eg];B[gd];W[eh]TR[on]LB[ol:a][ge:b][he:c][gf:d][fg:e][hf:f][gg:g][fh:h][di:i][gh:j][fb:k][hg:l][ek:m]C[If the marked white stone was played at 'a', then for W84, White can run out at 'b' amazingly! Next Black wegdes at 'c', W 'd', B 'e', W84, B 'f', W 'g', B 'h', W 'i', Black can capture in a ladder at 'j', but White could turn at 'k' with sente and gain a big profit, then come back to reinforce at 'm', White would obtain advantage on both the left and right at the sacrifice of five more stones. Moreover, Black's thickness can't be efficiently utilized, thus White would take the lead at one stroke!]
;B[ge];W[di]C[With regard to the sequence from B69 to W86, an exchange has resulted and each side takes two stones, although complicated, but it seems inevitable.];B[fb]C[B87: Black is very happy to block in sente.];W[db];B[bj]C[B89: Black turns to handle the two stones on the side, Black is favorable in this combat.];W[cl];B[dj];W[ej];B[bl];W[ah];B[ek];W[fj]
;B[cm];W[bm]LB[dm:a][dl:b][co:c]C[W98: If White ataris at 'a', then B98, W 'b' and B 'c', White is no good.];B[dm];W[bk];B[nk]TR[on]C[Because of the marked white stone, after Black jumps at 101, White's outside influence is defective.];W[nj];B[bn]C[B103: Black cuts and ataris for an exchange, as a result Black has just unloaded a burden.];W[al]
;B[co];W[dn];B[do];W[en];B[eo];W[fn];B[bo];W[fo];B[ep];W[gq];B[dl];W[aj];B[mj]
;W[mi];B[lj]LB[hp:a]C[B117 and B119: Black still aims at White's cut points, but in fact it is unnecessary, Black would be simply favorable for the game if Black just extends at 'a'.];W[hp]LB[er:a]C[In the game, after White plays the hane at 120 with sente, White's knight's move also becomes sente, it makes a huge difference in the center and corner, the situation becomes unclear.];B[iq];W[ip]LB[er:a][ll:b]C[W122: White should first make the knight's move at 'a', then peep at 'b', in the game after being taken one stone by Black, White already has incurred some losses.];B[lp];W[lo]

;W[ni];B[ki];W[jm];B[ml];W[kg];B[jh];W[of]LB[jg:a][hh:b]C[W144 is a mistake! White certainly should press at 'a', after Black jumps to 'b', then peep at 144, this would make a difference in ko threats and points.];B[qh];W[ph];B[jg];W[rh]
;B[rg];W[ri];B[oa]LB[ok:a][ol:b][oi:c][oh:d][oe:e][pi:f][hn:g][gk:h][pr:i]C[As to the sequence after B151, Black looks for trouble! Black now only need to connect at 'a', W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 'e', W 'f', B 'g' and W 'h', after taking profit in sente, Black can grab the big endgame at 'i' to bridge over, thus Black will easily achieve a small-margin victory.];W[ra];B[rc]

;B[gk];W[fk];B[dr]LB[qr:a][ol:b]C[For the ko fight, Black is forced to play such irrelevant moves at 169, 'a' and 'b'.];W[kf];B[jf];W[eq]LB[sc:a]C[In the byo-yomi time, in order to extend time, White has lost two ko thearts at 170 and 172, if W 170 at 'a', the outcome of the game would be still hard to guess. Particularly, after White's extension at 170, it would make a big difference if the hane at 171 were not played.];B[dq];W[sc];B[kn]

;W[qq]LB[lc:a]C[W226: But White has made the gross error! W226 should be reserved as a fatal ko threat, White should attach at 'a' at the top, thus Black dares not to start the ko, Black is difficult!];B[sr];W[sc];B[ck];W[dk];B[sd];W[ds]LB[jk:a][li:b][kh:c]C[The hane of W232 is the last losing move! White should give up the ko at 'a', White can play the two squeezing move at 'b' and 'c', this would make a big difference in the endgame after the exchange, perhaps it is a hard-to-imagine half-point game.];B[sf]

This is a brilliant game, the only regret is that we are unable to see the remarkable scene if the ladder plays out as described earlier in the game.];W[pe];B[mo];W[mn]
