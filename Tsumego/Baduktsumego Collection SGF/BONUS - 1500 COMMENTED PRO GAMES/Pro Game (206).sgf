;W[eq];B[fp]LB[dp:a][fq:b]C[The retreat of B7 is relatively seldom seen, the common play is to bump at 'a' or hane at 'b'.];W[dq]C[W8: If White crawls, it would lead to the large avalanche joseki, apparently White doesn't want to play that way.];B[cf];W[nc];B[co];W[bo];B[cn];W[dp];B[do]
;W[bn];B[cm];W[gq];B[pc];W[jc]LB[kc:a][ic:b]C[W20: White seeks variation, the usual play is making the two-space extension at 'a', after being forced by Black at 'b', Black's configuration would be too good.];B[qn];W[pk];B[lc];W[ne];B[kd];W[pf]
;B[jd];W[re];B[rd];W[mg]C[The sequence from B23 to W30 fits both sides' plan.];B[on];W[pm];B[pn];W[qp]C[W32 and W34 are Cho Chikun's style, in some special circumstances, this kind of play is very powerful.];B[np];W[no];B[mo];W[op]
;B[nn];W[nq];B[mp];W[mq];B[kp]LB[ni:a]C[B43 is a slow move, there is little value at the bottom, Black should play at 'a' to probe White.];W[hd]C[The invasion of W44 is inevitable.];B[hf]C[The cap of B45 is a state of mind, but Black also takes some risk.];W[ie];B[jg];W[if];B[ig]
;W[ke]
(;B[md]LB[hc:a][gc:b][ic:c][gd:d][je:e][kf:f]C[The sequence following B51 starting a direct confrontation is unreasonable, Black should attach at 'a', then W 'b', B 'c', next if White connects at 'd', Black can push at 'e', White is no good (see var a); If White doubles up at 'f', Black can cut at 'd', Black can be satisfied (see var b).];W[nd];B[je];W[jf];B[kf];W[le];B[kg]
;W[id]
(;B[kc]LB[me:a][lf:b][jb:c][ld:d][lb:e]C[B59 is a big crude move, Black should first push at 'a', if White still extends at 'b', Black can clamp at 'c', White is not good (see var a). Therefore, when B 'a', White will play atari at 59, Black connects and White crosses over at 'e', this variation would be acceptable for both sides (see var b).];W[jb];B[me];W[lf];B[mf];W[lg];B[nf];W[oh]C[After the knight's move, Black is about to be killed.]
;B[of];W[oe];B[ic]
(;W[hc]LB[ib:a][nb:b][mc:c][ld:d][lb:e][pe:f][pg:g]C[With B69, Black only wants to take advantage, unexpectedly it leads to a very bad move of W70. White certainly should answer at 'a', if Black still attach at 'b', then W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', Black would get killed (see var a). Thus, When White turns at 'a', Black can only cut at 'f', then W 'c', B 'g' and W 'd', this exchange would be absolutely to White's advantage (see var b).];B[kb];W[ib];B[nb]C[In the game, after Black attaches with B73, White already has no follow-up maneuver.];W[hg]C[White can only cut at 74.];B[nh]C[After Black crosscuts with B75, White's shape is about to collapse.]
;W[qe];B[pg];W[ph];B[ng];W[ob];B[mb];W[oc];B[pb];W[oa];B[lh]LB[qg:a]C[B85: Black's descent at 'a' would be more positive.];W[rb];B[gg]
;W[fc]C[With the exchange of B87 and W88, Black is happy.];B[pd]LB[qg:a]C[Black lives in gote with the sequence following B89, but it is small, Black still should descend at 'a', White would be very difficult.];W[pe];B[pa];W[qg];B[rc]C[Even like this, up to B93, Black is clearly favorable.];W[gp];B[go];W[ho];B[gn];W[hn]
;B[hm]LB[gm:a][hp:b]C[B99 is unnecessary, extending at 'a' is enough, later on Black is still left with the cut at 'b'.];W[gm];B[im];W[hh];B[ff]LB[gh:a]C[B103 is too heavy, now B45 is an almost worthless stone, Black should attach at 'a'.];W[gh];B[io]LB[hp:a]C[The sacrifice following B105 is not good either, Black should cut at 'a', which is just the right move.]

;B[rr];W[rn];B[qo];W[jp];B[ko];W[ip]LB[jq:a]C[W162 at 'a' is a little better.];B[eo];W[en];B[km];W[il];B[gi]LB[kk:a]C[B167 is almost the losing move, it is very small, Black certainly should jump to 'a', this way the outcome of the game is hard to imagine.]
