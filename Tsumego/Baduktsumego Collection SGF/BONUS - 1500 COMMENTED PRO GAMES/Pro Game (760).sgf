Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[Luo Xihe and Liu Xing are both fast-game good players, there will be a good fight when they meet.];W[dc];B[dq];W[pp];B[de]
;W[ce];B[cf];W[cd];B[co]C[B5 to B9 are Luo Xihe's favorite.];W[od];B[oc];W[pd];B[pc];W[qe];B[qc];W[nd];B[mc]LB[df:a]C[From W10 to W17, White is not bad, since B 'a' becomes gote in the upper-left corner.]
;W[nq];B[qj]LB[pf:a]C[B19 is the right move, otherwise after White hangs at 'a', Black's shape is not good.];W[ql];B[qg];W[ip];B[md];W[og]C[As to the cap of W24, ...];B[oj]LB[pf:a]C[..., the jump of B25 is too light. For Black to pierce through at 'a' doesn't look bad at all.];W[ph]C[However, in the game, following W26, White presses Black in sente.]
;B[ri];W[qh];B[rh];W[qf];B[rg];W[me]C[Then White gets to hane with W32, White is successful.];B[le];W[mf];B[qn]C[Following B35, knowing the ladder is not favorable, Black still wants to play this way, this is Xihe's talent.];W[pn];B[po];W[qo]
;B[oo];W[qp];B[pm];W[on];B[dd]C[The squeezing move of B43 is "ghost" move! Since Black at the bottom is light, Black can fight adequately here.];W[ec]C[W44: White is very confused whether to answer or not in fast games.];B[cc]C[After Black cuts with B45, the ladder is working.];W[bc];B[cb];W[df];B[fd];W[cg]
;B[bf];W[be];B[nn];W[dg];B[bb];W[bg];B[fc];W[ed];B[om];W[ee];B[rn]C[Following W48, up to B61, it forms an exchange.];W[lq]LB[he:a]C[W62 and B 'a', each side gets one, the situation is still even, White is a little thicker.]
;B[lf];W[lg];B[kg];W[lh];B[he];W[jf]C[White's reduction following W68 is good timing.];B[je];W[ie];B[if]C[B71: Black is not willing to fall behind.];W[ke];B[id];W[kf]LB[ld:a]C[W74: White can cut at 'a' instead, in the game, White ends in gote, it is not good.]
;B[ld];W[nc];B[nb];W[kd];B[lb];W[jg];B[gq];W[cn]LB[cm:a]C[W82 is territory-damaging, White can consider to make extension directly at 'a'.];B[dn];W[cm];B[bo];W[dm]
;B[hh];W[en];B[do]LB[kh:a]C[B89 is slow, if Black directly escapes B65 one stone at 'a', White is very dangerous.];W[ii];B[hi];W[fb];B[gb];W[eb]C[The counter-sente move of W92 and W94 is very big.];B[pg]C[B95 is alert!];W[pf];B[rq]C[B97 is early reserved tactic.]
;W[rp];B[qr];W[pr];B[sr];W[rs];B[sp]C[Through B103, it forms a ko fight, but as to Black it is almost worry-free, Black's chance comes.];W[so];B[ro];W[sq];B[ac];W[bd];B[sp];W[ig]

;W[gn];B[hl];W[bk]C[In the game, White makes life locally with some points, Black is in a losing trend.];B[bj];W[bl];B[di];W[bn];B[jq]C[B141 now is already late, and even as endgame play it is also not to Black's advantage.];W[ir];B[jp];W[jr];B[fo]
;W[fn];B[dl];W[em];B[oh]LB[of:a]C[B149: For Black at 'a' is still tesuji to probe.];W[nh];B[oi];W[rd];B[rc];W[gr]LB[ng:a][mg:b];B[fr]
