;B[qk];W[kq]C[White has many choices, the play of W8 is steady.];B[cq];W[dq];B[cp];W[do];B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[eq];B[cn]C[As for the result up to B17, Black can be satisfied.];W[qf]LB[nc:a]C[W18 is a positive play, to approach the corner at 'a' seems a little monotonous.]
;B[qe];W[pf];B[nc]LB[nd:a]C[Comparing B21 with 'a', each point has its own pros and cons.];W[qi];B[po]LB[qo:a]C[B23: For Black to make the small knight's move at 'a' is more solid.];W[ne];B[nd]LB[kc:a][qc:b]C[Although B25 appears crude, but it is very practical. If Black makes the extension at 'a', then White would enter the corner at 'b', Black is not comfortable.]
;W[me];B[kc];W[qm]TR[po]C[The invasion of W28 is a punishment to the marked black stone.];B[pl]LB[pm:a]C[B29 is strong and unyielding, but Black has no confidence of success, the original move is to press at 'a'.];W[qp]C[W30: White is alert.];B[pp];W[pm];B[om];W[ol]LB[qo:a]C[W34 is an inevitable play, White is very thick at the top, and White can connect back one stone at 'a' as well, so White has nothing to fear of.]
;B[nm];W[ok];B[qo];W[pk]C[Through 38, White has clearly gained.];B[cf];W[fc];B[fo];W[fr];B[bd];W[cc];B[lq]C[B45: Black wants to take advantage in sente, but it takes a big risk.];W[lr]
;B[mr];W[mq];B[lp];W[kr]C[The sequence from W46 and W50 is very tight.];B[dh]TR[lq]C[B51: Black has to come back and strengthen, as for the result, the attachment of the marked black stone is not to Black's advantage.];W[mp];B[rn]C[W52 and B53 are miai, each side can only get one, but B53 looks much bigger.];W[cj];B[ci];W[ej];B[fi]LB[ql:a]C[B57: Black should simply answer at 'a', the play in the game is just to White's delight.]
;W[fj];B[gi];W[gj];B[hi];W[ik]C[Through 62, White's moyo at the bottom becomes vivid.];B[dn];W[en];B[jk];W[jl];B[lo];W[nr];B[kl];W[jm]
;B[em]C[The sequence from B65 to B71 is not favorable to Black, White becomes very thick.];W[fm];B[ql]
(;W[qj]LB[rl:a][rk:b][rm:c][sm:d]C[W74: White has no alternative, if White plays at 'a' instead, then B 'b' and W 'c', it seems Black gets killed, but Black has a good move of B 'd' to reduce liberty, White is no good (see var a).];B[rl];W[ml]C[W76 is a good move, Black appears thin and weak instantly.];B[ij]C[B77 looks a little unreasonable.];W[jj];B[kk];W[km]LB[mo:a][ji:b]C[W78 and W80: White is not soft-hearted, making a miai of 'a' and 'b', White is sure to get one.]
;B[mo];W[ji];B[jo];W[jg]C[Through 84, White has clearly succeeded in the fight.];B[gc]C[B85: Black tries to mess up the situation.];W[gb];B[fb]
(;W[hc]LB[eb:a][fd:b][fa:c][ec:d]C[W88 is a relentless move, if W 'a', then B 'b', W 'c' and B 'd', White is not comfortable (see var a).];B[gd];W[ib];B[ga];W[hb];B[ec];W[fd];B[ed];W[fe]
;B[ee];W[eb];B[db];W[fa];B[dc]C[Through 101, it leads to an exchange, White obtains sente and should have nothing to complain.];W[rc]LB[fg:a][ei:b]C[W102 is the winning move in this game. However, before this move, to exchange W 'a' for B 'b' would be more favorable for White.];B[rd]LB[re:a][ob:b][rf:c][rg:d][pc:e]TR[gc]C[If B103 at 'a', then White can play the clever knight's move at 'b', Black is hard to handle. Therefore, before the attachment of the marked black stone, to exchange B 'c' and W 'd' is a good sequence play, later on if White strikes at 102, then Black can kill White by playing at 'e'.]
;W[pc];B[qc];W[qb];B[qd];W[oc];B[od];W[ra];B[nb];W[pa]C[Through 112, White has achieved a big victory.];B[rf];W[rg]LB[sd:a]C[W114: White is too greedy, White should simply hane at 'a' to live the corner, Black would have no any chance.]
;B[sc];W[sb]C[Through 116, although it becomes a ko, but White is still favorable in the game.];B[rb];W[rm]LB[co:a]C[The ko threat of W118 looks small, White certainly should push through at 'a', because the ko in the upper right corner is important to Black, if White wins the ko, then Black in the upper right is not alive as a whole.];B[rc];W[sl]C[Through 120, although Black gets a chance to rest, but the game is still slightly to White's advantage.];B[ff];W[ge]LB[gf:a]C[W122: White should play the hane at 'a'.];B[fn]

;B[nq]C[B183 is an excellent move!];W[ms];B[np]C[After B185, White clearly has incurred some loss, the game has been turned around, Black is a little favorable in the game.];W[re];B[nl];W[nk];B[rf];W[qg];B[sg];W[qs];B[or];W[os]
;B[rr]LB[mr:a][hr:b]C[B195 is the last losing move, Black should first take at' a', then W48 and B52, White can only connect at 'b', then Black can win the game by playing at 'a'.];W[ds];B[bq];W[ks]C[After W198, Black has to nurse a grievance of half-point defeat.];B[mr];W[mq];B[in];W[hn];B[lc];W[jc]
