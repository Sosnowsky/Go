Source:China Sports Weekly,
Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[Severals times in national games, Wang Xi stopped Gu Li from advancing, Wang Xi becomes Gu Li's only "painful" opponent.];W[dc]C[After Hue Xueming announced the start of the game, both sides played very quickly.];B[pq];W[cp];B[ep]
;W[eq];B[fp]LB[fq:a][co:b]C[Black exchanges in sente with B5 and B7, this is Gu Li's favorite set pattern, later on Black can block at 'a' and Black can also directly attach at 'b'.];W[dq];B[de];W[ee];B[cc];W[dd];B[cd];W[ef];B[cf];W[dh]
;B[bh];W[od];B[oc];W[nc];B[pc];W[nd];B[qf];W[jd];B[ed];W[ec]LB[db:a][fd:b][gc:c]C[The atari and turn of W26 is no good. White can consider to descend at 'a', next B 'b' and W 'c', this is better than the real game.]
;B[fd];W[fc];B[gd];W[gc];B[hd];W[hc];B[id];W[ic];B[je];W[ie]LB[hg:a]C[The cut of W36 is very strong and unyielding. For White to retreat is the original shape, this way Black will jump to 'a', and Black would take advantage with the exchange of B5 and B7.];B[if];W[df]
;B[ce];W[he];B[ge];W[hf];B[gf];W[hg];B[gg]C[Black's answer is very reasonable in the game.];W[jf]C[The atari of W46 is gote.];B[gi]C[Black puts more importance on the left side.];W[ke]C[With W48, White seems over-concentrated on the right side, White's profit in territory is very limited, but Black gets to strike first on the left side, White is in a bitter battle.];B[ej]
;W[dj];B[ei];W[di];B[dk]C[When Black hanes with B53, Wang Xi slowed down his play. The six white stones certainly don't want to die, but how to escape is a difficult problem.];W[ck];B[cl];W[dl];B[ek];W[cm];B[bl];W[bk]C[W60 is a trap.];B[dm]LB[bm:a]C[B61 is slow, perhaps this way Gu Li thinks Black can be satisfied, therefore he didn't push on in the flush of victory. The strongest tactic for Black is to turn at 'a', this way White's paid price would be even higher.]
;W[bm];B[el];W[al];B[co];W[bo]C[Although White is a little painful to cross over, but Black ends in gote.];B[dp];W[cq];B[fq];W[lq]C[White splits with W70, Black's potential is already being contained, Black's lead is not that big.];B[jq];W[lo];B[po]
;W[jo];B[kq];W[nq];B[pl];W[dn];B[en];W[dl];B[cl];W[qj];B[lm]LB[ql:a]C[The attack following B83 appears not realistic, after the game, Gu Li also admits he is not in his normal state. Black's original move is to stand at 'a', aiming at White's lonely stones and taking a chance to attack.];W[no];B[kp]
;W[ko];B[jm]C[B85 and B87 almost can be regarded as the losing moves of this game, these two moves are not that meaningful.];W[pr]C[White retreats with W88, Black has no place to continue attacking, Black's attack fails.];B[qr];W[or];B[ql];W[rm]C[W92: White delivers the fatal attack, this is a punishment to Black's attack with B85.];B[rl];W[qp];B[qq];W[pp];B[op]
;W[rp];B[oq];W[oo];B[np];W[mp];B[nr];W[mq];B[ps];W[pn]C[Through W106, White easily destroys Black's territory, Black's loss is heavy.];B[mn];W[mo];B[rq];W[nm]
;B[nl];W[ml];B[nk];W[mm];B[og]LB[pi:a]C[B115: Black can only make the knight's move at 'a', but even this way, Black still can't avoid a small defeat.];W[oi];B[ni];W[nh];B[oh];W[nj];B[mi];W[ok]C[W122 is a clever move! Black can't seal off White, Black already is about to collapse.]
;B[qn];W[rn];B[ol];W[mj];B[pi];W[oj];B[mk];W[li];B[lk];W[mr];B[os];W[mh]C[White takes two stones with W134, meaning Black must kill White's dragon, but as to professional plays, this is an impossible task.];B[qm]
;W[qo];B[ln];W[ll];B[nn];W[kl];B[om];W[ip];B[hr];W[km];B[kn];W[jn];B[on];W[kk]
;B[im];W[hm]C[White already has a living shape.

The following moves are omitted.])
