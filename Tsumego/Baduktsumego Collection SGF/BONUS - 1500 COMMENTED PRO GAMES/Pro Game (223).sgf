Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[Congratulations to Gu Li, he successfully defended his title again. Zhou Ruiyang still needs to make persistent efforts, his future is unlimited.];W[pp];B[dc]C[B1 and B3 are Gu Li's most adept opening, at crucial time, he must use it.];W[cp];B[eq]
;W[ce]C[W6 is also Zhou Ruiyang's favorite play.];B[nq];W[qn];B[dh];W[jq];B[dm];W[do];B[cr]C[B11 and B13 are interesting moves and never seen before, it should be Gu Li's newly studied secret weapon.];W[fp];B[fq];W[gp];B[hr]
;W[ip]LB[ed:a][dj:b]C[W18 is the original move locally, but to be more positive, White can consider first press at 'a', then invade at 'b'.];B[dj]C[In the game, Black strengthens back with B19 beautifully and can be satisfied.];W[oc];B[kc];W[dg]LB[ed:a][dd:b]C[White first attaches with W22 then makes the knight's move at 'a', it is interesting, if White directly plays at 'a', Black will push and cut at 'b', White is not good.];B[cg];W[eg];B[eh]
;W[ed];B[ec];W[fd];B[gb];W[cc]LB[fg:a]C[W30 is an overplay, to play at 'a' is the original move.];B[pr];W[qq];B[dd];W[de];B[cd]LB[fg:a]C[After Black captures the corner with B35 and hanes at the head at 'a', White's shape is over-concentrated and White is painful.]
;W[bd];B[bc];W[ch];B[ci];W[bh];B[bg];W[fc];B[cb];W[fb];B[fg];W[ff];B[ef];W[df]
;B[gf];W[fe];B[pc];W[od];B[qf];W[gg];B[fh];W[ke]C[W56: White tries to attack Black, it is really far-fetched, but except this, White also doesn't have any good choices.];B[id];W[ie];B[le]C[B57 and B59 are very good moves.];W[lf]
;B[me];W[pd];B[qc];W[pf];B[he]C[After B65, White instead is being enclosed.];W[if];B[hd];W[hf];B[ge];W[eb];B[db];W[kd];B[lc]
;W[ib]C[If it were not the clever move of W74, White's big dragon is already dangerous.];B[hb];W[hc];B[ic];W[jb];B[jc];W[gc];B[mf]C[However, Black allows White to make life, through B81, White's two groups are being separated, White instantly sinks into a bitter battle.];W[qg];B[rf];W[pg];B[lg]
;W[kf];B[hg]C[B87: Black first captures one stone to ensure his own safety, it is steady.];W[jh];B[mi]C[Then B89 makes White not able to look after both sides, Gu Li tightly takes control of the game.];W[oi];B[nk];W[ki];B[lk]LB[ni:a]C[B93: Black can consider to hit at 'a', Black itself has no any defect, next Black can attack White strongly .];W[kk];B[kl];W[jl]C[W94 and W96 are good moves! Black is a little uncomfortable.]
;B[kj]LB[pk:a]C[B97: Black can consider first to attack White at 'a'.];W[jk];B[jj]C[Although Black is very happy to push out with B97 and B99, ...];W[li];B[lj];W[mh]C[..., but White also connects safely with W102, Black seems to gain nothing.];B[mg];W[nh];B[ji];W[kh];B[kb]
;W[ga];B[hi];W[ob];B[mb];W[pa]C[W112 is a clever move! Black's corner can't live unconditionally, White takes a very favorable turn!];B[rb];W[ra];B[rg];W[rh];B[ri];W[sh];B[ni]C[The play of B117 and B119 is inevitable, if Black makes life the corner inconveniently, White will take a big advantage from outside.]
;W[lh];B[pi]C[B121 is an excellent tesuji! Gu Li must have seen this move before deciding to sacrifice the corner bravely.];W[qh]LB[ph:a][oj:b][sg:c]C[At this critical close-contact moment, W122 is a fatal mistake, White should play at 'a', next B 'b' and W 'c', this way White can kill the corner unconditionally, the situation is still early.];B[oh]C[After the atari of B123, the corner becomes ko-alive, White incurs a big loss.];W[ng];B[og];W[nf];B[of];W[ne]
;B[pe]LB[oj:a]C[B129 is also a tesuji, but in fact to take at 'a' is the simplest way. This way although White also can capture Black's corner, Black in the corner will form the famous "Knife Five" shape, which has ten liberties, Black can take chance and tight liberties from outside, Black will be simply favorable. Of course, after the exchange, the situation is also slightly to Black's advantage.];W[oe];B[oj];W[qe];B[re];W[sg];B[pe];W[rj];B[rk];W[qe];B[ep];W[eo]

;B[bi];W[cm];B[bq]C[B169: Black is alert! After Black gets this point, White's situation is hopeless.];W[cq];B[br]C[Afterwards, Gu Li retreats a little bit under Zhou's tenacious resistance but still successfully defended his title by 3.5 points in the end.];W[qr];B[el];W[no];B[on];W[ig];B[gh];W[ol]
