(;SZ[19]EV[6th Samsung Cup semi-final game 3]DT[2001-11-09]PC[Korea]KM[6.5]PB[Lee Changho]PW[Chang Hao]BR[9p]WR[9p]RE[W+R]C[Copyright by gogameworld.com and weiqi.tom.com.];B[pd]C[This is the semi final game 3, in the first two games, they are tied at 1:1.

Lee Changho 9p of Korea is Black.];W[dd]C[Because this is the final game in this series, they are guessing stones again, Lee Changho has picked Black. After seeing this result, Korean players in the study room are all showing a satisfactory face, but what I want to remind is that White won the first two games.

Chang Hao 9p of China is White.];B[pq];W[dp]C[The semi finals of this Samsung Cup have drawn a broad attention, because the four participated players can be considered to represent the highest level in the modern Go world.]
;B[fq];W[cn];B[jp];W[qn];B[po]C[So far, the opening is same as that in the last game, the only difference is that they have switched colors.];W[rp];B[ql];W[pn];B[qo];W[ro];B[qq];W[rm];B[on]
;W[pl];B[om];W[pk]C[Through 20, both sides have played very fast, White is very thick and Black's moyo is also very big, both sides have nothing to complain, however if Chang Hao wants to win the game, he must find "unique" moves.];B[qi]LB[fo:a]C[B21: Black starts to vary, in the game 2, Chang Hao elected to jump to 'a' directly.];W[qk];B[fo]C[B23 is a good point.];W[lq]LB[jq:a][no:b][oo:c][nq:d]C[W24: White dives into Black's territory, reflecting Chang Hao's fighting spirit. White can make use of the point at 'c', so here White is not that very dangerous, if it leads to the variation of B 'a', W 'b', B 'c' and W 'd', White should be not bad.]
;B[lp]LB[mp:a][lo:b][jq:c][kq:d][kr:e][kp:f][mr:g][jr:h][js:i][ir:j][nq:k][or:l][no:m][oo:n][nr:o]C[After the attachment of B25, if W 'a', B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f', W 'g', B 'h', W 'i', B 'j', W 'k', B 'l', W 'm', B 'n' and W 'o', White can live, moreover, after W 'a' and B 'b', White can also make the knight's move at 'h'. The key is how White can live comfortably and also make Black's outside thickness less powerful. It can be said that Chang Hao's strategy in the game 1 is correct, not giving an inch in territory.]
;W[mp];B[lo];W[jq];B[iq];W[kq];B[ir];W[nr];B[no]LB[np:a][mo:b][mn:c][nq:d][mq:e][oo:f][nn:g]C[B33: For Black to clamp at 'a' appears a good move but that's not the case actually, followed by W 'b', B 'c', W33, B 'd', W 'e', B 'f' and W 'g', Black would be left with too many weak points.]
;W[pr];B[qr]LB[or:a][jr:b][kr:c][ps:d][oq:e][os:f]C[After B35, White feels a little restricted. If W 'a', B 'b', W 'c' and B 'd', White is no good, if W 'e', B 'd' and W 'f', it will lead to a ko fight.];W[oq];B[np];W[mq]LB[jr:a][ps:b][os:c][ms:d][kp:e][mo:f][kr:g]C[W38 is to most people's surprise, all the time they are studying the variation of W 'a', B 'b' and W 'c', which leads to a ko. However, after W38, if B 'a', W 'd', B 'b' and W 'c', it still would lead to a ko, and over here what we must pay attention is, when B 'a', White can't block at 'g' impulsively, otherwise, if B 'd', White will die unconditionally. Black has the weak points at 'e' and 'g', Black also has some apprehensions. Lee Changho is pondering.]
;B[ks]LB[ls:a][lr:b][js:c][ms:d][jr:e][ps:f][os:g][qs:h][nq:i][mr:j][or:k][ns:l]C[B39 is severe, if W 'a', then B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f', W 'g', B 'h', W 'i' and B 'j', White would die; If White makes the diagonal's extension at 'd', then B 'i', W 'a', B 'g', W 'f', B 'k', W 'l' and B 'm', White would also ends in a dead shape. In other words, White already can't make two eyes locally.];W[mo]
;B[mn];W[ln]C[W42: White can only seek to make use of it for other purpose.];B[jo]LB[mm:a][nn:b][ll:c][jr:d]C[After B43, if W 'a', B 'b', W 'd' and B 'd', White is short one liberty. Chang Hao is pondering.];W[op];B[oo];W[mm];B[nn];W[ll];B[ol]
;W[ok];B[os];W[qf]LB[pf:a][qg:b][rf:c]C[W52: Obviously White has acknowledged the outcome at the bottom. White should have incurred some losses, but considering that this area originally is already within Black's influence, White still can make many uses from the outside, so the damage is not that big as it appears. If White makes the high approach at 'a', Black probably would attach underneath at 52, W 'b' and B 'c'.];B[pf];W[pe];B[oe];W[qe];B[qd];W[pg]LB[od:a][rh:b][qg:c][rg:d][rd:e][rf:f][nd:g][oc:h][nc:i]C[W58: If the cut at 'a' is working then it would be too ideal, but if White cuts at 'a', Black can extend at 58, followed by W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 'e', W 'f', B 'g', W 'h', and B 'i', White fails.]
;B[of];W[qh];B[og];W[oh];B[nh];W[oi];B[nc]C[Through 65, White has about 30 points on the right side and Black has about 40 points at the bottom.];W[gc];B[cq]C[B67: Black dares to ruin White's territory without any scruple, this is also one of White's loss on the lower side, because Black is very thick.];W[dq]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.];B[cp];W[co]
;B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[eq];B[fr];W[eo];B[fn];W[hp]LB[ip:a][fp:b][gp:c][gq:d]C[W78 is alert, if B79 at 'a', then White's tactic of W 'b', B 'd' and W 'd' is obvious, White still have a lot of ko threats in the lower right, Black may not have courage to play this way.];B[gp]LB[ip:a][io:b][ps:c][lr:d][hq:e][hr:f][js:g][jr:h][kr:i][is:j][mr:k]C[Black answers with B79, then W78 can be considered as White's taking advantage in sente, the cut at 'a' will also have some subtle effect on the capturing race on the right side, for example if White cuts at 'a', Black can't kill at 'b', otherwise W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f', W 'g', B 'h', W 'i', B 'j' and W 'k', Black's corner will get killed, this way White can make many uses for other purposes at around 'a' and 'b'.]
;W[ck]C[The extension of W80 is a good point. Now although Black is easier to play, but the left side is still quite open, the outcome of the game is still unknown.];B[cj]C[The attachment of B81 is not to Black's advantage.];W[dk];B[cd];W[ce];B[be];W[de];B[bd]TR[cj][dk]C[B87: Black still thinks that living in the corner is bigger, if so, the marked black stone appears to be damaging, because the extension of the marked white stone is still very big.];W[bf];B[dc]
;W[ec];B[db];W[cg];B[eb]C[The turn of B93 should be reserved, this way although there is still some aji in the corner, but obviously this is better than the real game.];W[fb];B[ed];W[fc];B[jc];W[bb]LB[bc:a][ae:b][ab:c][cb:d][cc:e][ba:f][ad:g][da:h][ea:i][af:j]C[After W98, if B 'a', W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 'e', W 'g', B 'h', W 'h', B 'i' and B 'j', this would lead to a two-step ko in the corner.]
;B[cb];W[bc];B[ba];W[ab];B[cc];W[ea];B[da];W[ad];B[ae];W[fa]C[Through 108, Black has clearly failed, after B81, Black has made several mistakes, it is really unimaginable.];B[ac];W[ps];B[qs]
;W[or]TR[jc]C[As to Lee Changho, when playing the marked stone extension, he must have seen this two-step ko. Over this period, White has further narrowed down the difference between both sides.];B[ls]C[B113 can't be omitted.];W[ad];B[km];W[lm];B[ac];W[nl]TR[ed]C[The number of White's ko threats is "infinite", although it is a two-step ko for Black, Black's burden is still not small, What Black pays more importance is, after winning the ko threat, the marked black stone will becomes White's serious hidden trouble.];B[kp];W[ad];B[ni]

;W[ej];B[ac];W[pm];B[pp];W[ad];B[ei];W[fi];B[ac];W[eh]LB[je:a]C[With W154, White has captured Black and should be very satisfied, later on if Black eliminates the ko and it is White's turn, the cap at 'a' is a good move. White already see the dawn of victory.];B[aa];W[id];B[jd]
;W[ie];B[je];W[if]C[Through 160, White is clearly favorable, if nothing unexpected happens, Chang Hao should win this game!];B[kg];W[jh];B[dm]LB[cm:a][ek:b][fj:c][el:d]C[B163 is alert, if White plays at 'a', then B 'b', W 'c' and B 'd', White is not comfortable.];W[el]C[After considering for a while Chang Hao plays at 164. W164 is a very bold move, this move has completely destroyed Black's last hope.];B[af]
