On 8/6, the game 4 of the 37th Korean Wangwi title mach, the defending champion Lee Changho 9p defeated the challenger Cho Hunhyun 9p, therefore won his eighth consecutive title in this event.];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[qk]C[Lee Changho is keen on "Low Chinese Opening" recently.]
;W[mp];B[kp];W[oo]LB[pp:a]C[W8: As to the counter-pincer of B7, White can attach at 'a', this was played in one of their games, so this is a variation.];B[qo];W[ln];B[fq];W[cn];B[ip]C[However, Black forms a good shape with B13, White's shape is no good.];W[er];B[fr];W[eq]
;B[fo];W[fn]LB[jc:a][nc:b]C[W18: White's usual move is to make the extension at 'a' or approach the corner at 'b'.];B[gn];W[gm];B[ep]LB[do:a]C[B21 is a good move, Black can also consider to attach at 'a', Black can fight.];W[eo];B[fp];W[do];B[fm]
;W[en];B[hn];W[gl];B[ch];W[cf];B[ck];W[eh];B[fk];W[fl];B[ek];W[el]LB[dl:a][di:b][bm:c]C[W36: White attaches in gote and elects not to peep at 'a' to obtain sente, the purpose is to attack Black next with the diagonal's move at 'b', and the attached problem is that Black can take advantage in sente by playing at 'c'.]
;B[dq];W[dr];B[bm];W[bn]LB[di:a][jc:b]C[W40: White still should consider tenuki or first probe Black with the diagonal at 'a'. Overall, the big point at 'b' is a very urgent point, which both sides must strive for.];B[jc]C[B41: Black first makes the extension, Black is favorable for the game.];W[hc];B[nc];W[re];B[rd];W[qd]LB[qe:a]C[W46: Normally White would extend at 'a', this way Black will be also relieved.]

;W[nf];B[pg];W[ph];B[oe];W[oh]C[In order to support the left side, the sequence from W46 to W64 is coherent thinking.];B[po]C[However, after Black reinforces with B65, Black is clearly leading in territory.];W[ol]LB[di:a][bi:b][bg:c]C[W66 is superficially clever, now the diagonal's attack at 'a' is imperative. If Black answers at 'b', Black can continue his attack with the diagonal at 'c', this way White would have a chance of winning.];B[on]C[In the game, B67 is unnecessary, Black should directly strengthen the left side.

After this move, it is time for noon break.]
;W[kq];B[jq];W[lp];B[ei]LB[ko:a]C[B71: From the state of mind, Black wants to extend at 'a', in the game White gets to atari at 'a', which is Lee Changho's unique judgement. Of course, W 'a' is also a huge move, White becomes thick on the board. B67 and B71 are not consistent, can this be considered as Black's mistake?];W[fi];B[di];W[ko];B[qh]LB[je:a][fc:b][ec:c]C[Next the atari of B75 is inexplicable, Black should jump to 'a', reducing White's center potential and aiming to invade at 'b' as well, White's proper move is to reinforce at 'c', then Black can atari at 75.]
;W[qi];B[rg];W[jr];B[ir];W[jp];B[iq];W[rh];B[qg]C[At the time of playing B83, White still have chance to jump out.];W[je]C[After the cap of W84, the situation becomes unclear, Black's tiny advantage in the opening period has disappeared.];B[ke];W[jd];B[cc]C[B87: Black elects to enter the corner, worrying that he may lose the chance later on.]
;W[dc];B[kd];W[kc];B[lc];W[kb];B[jb];W[kf];B[fh]C[After the hane of W94, Black cuts at 95, Black has clearly failed.];W[pm];B[qm]LB[pj:a][oj:b][pi:c][gh:d]C[B97: Black should make the diagonal's move at 'a', then W 'b', B97, W 'c' and B 'd', this way it would lead to a close game. Lee's endgame skill can be fully utilized.]
;W[ql];B[rl];W[pk]C[White makes a ko tenaciously with W98 and W100.];B[pl];W[lb];B[mb];W[ql];B[cq];W[cr];B[pl];W[ld];B[le];W[ql]

;W[eb];B[pl];W[bd]LB[pj:a]C[Both sides rack their brains to fight the ko by using their own ko threats. Through 125, W126 killing the corner is a calm move, if Black eliminates the ko, then White will retreat at 'a', Black is hard to enter into the center.];B[ic];W[hd];B[pj]C[B129: Black has no choice but to hane and invoke the ko fight.];W[ql];B[ec];W[fb];B[pl];W[me]
;B[ld];W[ql];B[br];W[bq];B[pl];W[dg];B[dh]LB[ok:a][pi:b][bh:c][cg:d][df:e][bg:f][bj:g]C[B141: If Black draws back at 'a', White will capture thee black stones by playing at 141, which is huge, next if Black cuts at 'b', then W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f', White has a good jump at 'g', Black is no good.]
;W[ql];B[cp];W[bp];B[pl];W[bk]C[Although W146 is damaging, but the ko fight on the right side is much more important!];B[bl];W[ql];B[qj];W[rm];B[pl];W[cj];B[dl];W[ql]
;B[qn];W[rk];B[pl];W[dj];B[dk];W[ql];B[rj];W[sl];B[oj]C[B161 and B163: Black has no alternative but to give way.];W[op];B[ok];W[nl];B[pl]
;W[qq]LB[ej:a]C[In this crucial moment, W168 is the losing move! White should play the push at 'a' as a ko threat, Black can strengthen himself, in the game White help Black to fix his weak points! It is a big damaging move!];B[qr];W[pp];B[qp];W[rq];B[rr];W[pk];B[oq]C[After Black crawls with B175, White is already very hard to win the game.];W[nj];B[nk];W[mk]

;W[pn];B[rp];W[mj];B[ng];W[mg];B[mh];W[mi];B[bc];W[ca];B[im];W[nh]LB[il:a]C[W202 is perhaps the last losing move. White certainly should attach at 'a', no matter what enclosing the center territory is much bigger then playing at 202 which is worth only 14 endgame points.];B[jl]C[After Black makes the diagonal's extension of B203, White already has no chance of winning.]
