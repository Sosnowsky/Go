;W[dn];B[jp];W[pn];B[qo];W[qf]LB[pi:a]C[W10: For White to extend at 'a' is relatively steady, in the game next Black's clamp at 'a' can be foreseen.];B[pi];W[nd];B[pf];W[qc];B[pc]C[The play of W12 and W14 is relatively often seen recently.];W[pg]LB[qe:a][qg:b]C[B15 is the right move, no matter whether Black hangs at 'a' or hanes at 'b', being crawled by White at 15 is always territory-damaging.]
;B[pe];W[ph];B[qi];W[re];B[rc];W[ng];B[nb]C[In the game, the sequence up to the knight's move of B23 is normal from both sides.];W[ni]LB[qn:a][nj:b][mj:c][nk:d]TR[pn]C[W24: White can consider to block at 'a' directly to initiate a fight. The purpose of W24 is to hope Black will crawl at 'a', but White didn't expect Black would attach at 'b' strongly. Next White still must immediately pull out the marked white stone, this way the exchanges of W24 and W 'c' for B 'b' and B 'd' are not to White's advantage.]
;B[nj];W[mj];B[nk];W[po];B[qn];W[pp];B[qp];W[oq];B[pr]LB[pm:a][np:b]C[B33: Black normally will play hane at 'a', this way White will atari at 33, Black connects at 3-3, next White hangs at 'b'.];W[pm];B[oi]

(;W[mi]LB[nh:a][mk:b][or:c][rl:d][lq:e]C[W36 is heavy. White should connect at 'a', then B 'b', White can take tenuki to play at 'c', B 'd' and W 'e', this is clearly better than the real game (see var a).
];B[mk];W[pk]LB[rl:a][lf:b]C[The exchange of W38 for B 'a' is also damaging, at times Japanese players are too formalistic to the shape. Now White's striking move of W38 is already not the key point any more! White certainly should directly strengthen at 'b'.

;B[kj];W[il];B[hk];W[hl];B[gl];W[jl]LB[gm:a][jj:b]TR[hk][ik]C[The exchange of W80 for B 'a' is a very bad move! This way the marked black stones become light. White should simply crosscut at 'b', this way Black would have some apprehensions. In the game, Black's play is very light and nimble, White only captures two useless stones. So far, Black is clearly favorable.

(;W[rd]LB[mb:a][mc:b][jb:c][hb:d][nc:e][lb:f][ob:g][ma:h][qb:i]C[W134: If White simply attaches at 'a', Black would be very troublesome. Because if Black will pushes at 'b', then W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f', W 'g', B 'h' and W 'i', Black would be dangerous (see var a), therefore with B133 Black should simply hang at 'd' allowing White to make life.];B[qb];W[me];B[nf];W[mb]
