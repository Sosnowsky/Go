(;SZ[19]EV[Japan 7th Kisei title match 7]PB[Fujisawa Hideyuki]PW[Cho Chikun]PC[Japan]DT[1983-03-16]KM[5.5]BR[9p]WR[9p]RE[W+R];B[pd]C[The game that unified the three majors
The 7th Kisei title match was very dramatic, after Fujisawa Hideyuki won the first three games, the challenger Cho Chikun griped tightly, won back three games in a row and tied the best-of-7 series at 3:3, in this situation, the decisive game 7 was ready to play, you can imagine how intense it would be, the place was Tokyo, Japan.];W[cc];B[pq];W[cq];B[qk]C[Fujisawa Hideyuki took Black and elected to play "Chinese Fuseki" with B1, B3 and B5, however Cho 9p who always prefers territory played two 3-3, thus came a brilliant situation.]
;W[nc];B[pf];W[pb];B[qc];W[kc];B[fp];W[cn];B[ip];W[po];B[op]LB[qp:a]C[B15 is Kisei's novel play, when this move was passed over to the study room, Kudo Norio 9p who was commenting the game on the big board was surprised: "what happened? Is this the real move". Normally, when White approaches the corner with W14, Black will always make the diagonal at 'a', and he thinks the diagonal at 15 is not good. However after thinking for 7 minutes, Kisei bravely released B15, it seems this was not a careless move. Thus Kudo Norio 9p commented: In such an important game, Kisei dares play this kind of novel move, at any rate, this bold spirit is first worth admiring.];W[qq];B[qp]
;W[pp];B[rq];W[oq];B[qr];W[pr];B[qq];W[np];B[dd]C[When White attaches at 16, Black hanes out at 17, this is also coherent novel conception, up to W24, the sequence is inevitable, next Black plays the ladder breaker at 25. The above variation was all Kisei's study result, if White takes one stone in the lower right, White must pay a price in the upper left corner.];W[dc]LB[oo:a][cd:b]C[However after the game, Kisei said, he is reckless in nature and he always can't change. When Black plays the ladder breaker of B25, White extends with W26, it is to Kisei's surprise. By Kisei's plan, White should take at 'a' with W26, next Black blocks down at 'a', this variation would be more severe than the play in the game.];B[ed]
;W[oo];B[cd];W[ec];B[fd];W[fc];B[gd];W[ch]C[W34 is a stunning move, "stay away from thickness", this move obviously objects this maxim. Takagawa Shukaku 9p thinks White is unreasonable. However Kobayashi Koichi 9p said: "if I were White, I also want to play here", but Teacher Sakata Eio 9p argued: "No, recently I also played too tightly". 

Obviously, W34 is challenging at Black's thick wall, ignoring thickness, Cho's style is similar to Kobayashi's.];B[dk]C[Black's invasion of B35 is inevitable.];W[eh];B[gh];W[ej];B[dn]C[The attachment of B39 also belongs to Fujisawa's style.]

;B[em]C[Through B53, Black becomes very thick in the lower left and also encloses some territory at the bottom.];W[gg];B[hg];W[gf];B[jd];W[hf];B[jc]C[White counterattacks with W54, Black strikes first at the top with B57 and B59, preparing to attack the left side, after Black blocks down with B59, Cho 9p keeps shaking his head, thinking his play is no good.];W[gc];B[hc];W[kb];B[hh];W[ig]
;B[hj];W[ef];B[kd];W[ld];B[le]C[B69 is the sealing move for the first day, after fighting for one day, Kisei Fujisawa only has used for two hours. Overall, the situation is still hard to say. In the lower left, Black already connects together as a whole.];W[md];B[mf];W[qb]C[Black seals off this white group with the diagonal of B71 and also connects his left and right side, Black is very thick.];B[lp];W[nr];B[qn]C[When B73, W74 seems to force the play of B75, Kudo Norio thinks this set pattern is to Black's advantage.];W[kq]
;B[lq]C[The play of B77 is simple and clear.];W[lr];B[kp];W[jq];B[jp];W[fh];B[hb];W[ie];B[id];W[ph]C[W86 is a game-deciding move.];B[oi];W[pj]C[When forcing with the diagonal of B87, Black already expected the play of W88, Black's play is clever.]
;B[pi];W[qj];B[qi];W[ri];B[rk];W[rj];B[qh]C[Black starts the full attack on White with B93 and B95.];W[oj];B[ol];W[nk];B[ni];W[nl];B[nm]
;W[mm];B[om];W[ll]C[Through W104, White is already not dangerous.];B[kk]C[As to B105, a lot of people think Black should handle the lower side, so far it is the biggest place, because B105 basically comes to nothing, people start worrying for Kisei.];W[mn];B[nn];W[mo];B[ih];W[jg];B[fa];W[bc];B[cf]C[In the upper left corner, B111 is a very good move, when White descends with W112, Black jumps to B113, this is again a good point to attack White on the left.]

;B[jr];W[ds];B[es];W[cs];B[fr];W[iq];B[ir];W[rb];B[hm];W[ik]C[At 3:00pm in the afternoon, after W136, Cho Chikun only has 10 minutes left in the regular time, however Fujisawa still has five hours's free time, the situation seems not to have any big change. All people pays so much attention on this game, experts in the Nihon Kiin also draw the conclusion of Black's advantage, it looks like we can imagine Fujisaw Hideyuki 9p's majestic appearance of winning the seventh consecutive Kisei title.];B[kh];W[kg];B[lh]
;W[rd];B[jb]C[The block of B141 is also very valuable.];W[nf]C[Under the time pressure in overtime, after thinking for one minute, Cho Chikun released W142, starting the comeback journey. "What happened? I'm not so clear?", after Kisei seeing this move, he shakes his head continuously, staring at the top black group.];B[ne];W[me];B[nd];W[mg];B[lf]C[White ataris with W146, Black has to connect with B147, then White also connects with W148. Now although Black's territory has been reduced a little, but the game is still slightly to Black's advantage.];W[lg];B[ke];W[mb];B[ng]
;W[nh];B[of];W[mh];B[mi];W[jh];B[ji];W[oh];B[qg];W[hq];B[hr];W[im];B[lk]C[B163 is the last losing move, this is the most regrettable move during the time he exclusively controlled Kisei for six consecutive times and had to give way his precious Kisei seat. This move also caused Kisei to lose 23 million Japanese Yen.];W[hn]C[After White hanes with W164, the situation has been turned around, just because of the exchange here, a new Kisei was born.]
