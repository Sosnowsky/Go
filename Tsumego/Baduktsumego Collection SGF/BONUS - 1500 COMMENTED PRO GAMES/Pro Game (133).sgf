A Game Shocking Japanese Go World

In 1976, "Nie whirlwind" is blowing hard, in his visit to Japan, he defeated strong players such as Fujisawa Hideyuki 9p and Iwata Tatsuaki 9p consecutively, next he was facing a more powerful player Ishida Yoshio 9p. Ishida Yoshio 9p was less than 30, but already had achieved Honinbo title for five times and obtained Honorary Honinbo, he was also the winner of Meijin title.];B[pd];W[dc];B[dp];W[qp];B[ce];W[oq]C[W6: White takes tenuki and protects the corner with a small knight's move without hurry. This is a favorite play of Japanese professional high-dan players to deal with the opposite-star opening, the purpose is to play smoothly, first obtain territory and then win the game in a steady way.]
;B[fd]LB[de:a]C[B7 preparing for the great slant joseki is my planned move, enticing White to attach out at 'a', this is a way to effectively use the opposite-star opening.];W[ed];B[fc]C[In order to lead the game to a fierce fight, not allow the opponent to obtain territory steadily and disrupt the opponent's plan, I elects to descend with B9.];W[ef];B[fe];W[ee];B[ff]C[B13 is an interesting move, pressing consecutively is also very powerful.];W[cf];B[bf];W[cg];B[cc]
;W[cb];B[bb];W[cd];B[bc];W[db]C[White elects to connect with W22.];B[bd];W[bg];B[dd];W[de];B[ec];W[cd];B[be];W[dd]
;B[ba];W[fg];B[gg];W[fh];B[gh];W[fi];B[gi];W[fj];B[md];W[hf]C[W40 is alert! It is excellent timing.];B[gf];W[qj]C[W42 is the biggest point on the board.]
;B[oi]C[B43 is a good point to expand the moyo at the top.];W[kc]C[W44: White invades immediately, showing Ishida 9p's strength.];B[pk];W[qk];B[pl];W[qg];B[ic];W[og];B[mg]C[The cap of B51 is a very severe and good move, forcing White to make life at the top.];W[ib];B[hb];W[jc]
;B[id];W[nc];B[nd];W[oc];B[od];W[mb];B[pc];W[pb];B[qb];W[ob];B[jb];W[kb];B[ia]C[Black takes one stone in sente with B65 and B67, locally White is still not completely alive.]
;W[re];B[ql];W[ka]LB[qc:A]C[W70: If White cuts at 'A', although White can capture B63 and make life in the corner, but White's eye shape on the right side will be threatened.];B[cm];W[ck]C[Through W72, let's do a situation judgement. White: 15 points on the left side, 5 points at the top, 9 points on the right side, 11+ points in the lower right corner, plus 5 points komi, the total is 45 points. Black: 5 points in the upper left corner, 10 points in the lower left corner, 2 points on the right and about 25 points in the center, the total for Black is about 42 points.
];B[mq]C[Now White is slightly leading in territory, but Black is sente, and Black also has thickness in the center, so Black is not bad.];W[oo];B[mo];W[ke]C[W76 is very big, destroying Black's center territory and also aiming at Black's weakness on the right side.];B[eq]C[B77 is also very big, W76 and B77 are miai.]
;W[oh]LB[mi:A][mh:B]C[W78 looks like a reinforcing move, in reality it contains murderous intentions secretly. If Black plays at 'A' carelessly, being wedged by White at 'B', Black would have no way to handle.];B[rd];W[qe];B[lc];W[lb];B[qd];W[iq];B[nr];W[or];B[kq]C[Black first takes advantage with B85, then seeks safety with one-space extension of B87, watching how White to act.]
;W[cq]C[W88: White immediatly enters the corner to manage himself, it is Ishida's style of "game-deciding move", but this move is questionable. If White escapes to the center, Black dare not force and attack, because Black is not completely alive in the lower right, especially Black's right side is much weaker.];B[cp];W[er];B[fr];W[dr];B[bp];W[bq]C[W94 making life in the corner is the losing move of the game, White should give up the three stones in the corner and strengthen the center.];B[gq];W[br];B[pi];W[qi];B[mi]C[Black strengthens himself with B97 and B99. So far, the vital point for both sides must be the center, how to reduce Black's influence at the maximum limit and also expand his own territory as much as possible is the key for White in this game.]
;W[hn]C[After a long meditation, Ishida plays W100.];B[bk]C[Black attaches with B101, using his powerful surrounding influence to attack W84.];W[cj];B[ph];W[pg];B[hl];W[fp];B[gp]C[As to the peep of W106, the counterattack of B107 is inevitable.];W[fn];B[go];W[gn];B[cs]C[B111: Black suddenly strikes the corner, this is my proudest move in this game. Because of this move, Black has established his victory.]
;W[dn]C[The jump of W112 is also a good move, first escaping the center stones and also leaving the maneuver to save White's corner.];B[fo]C[B113 is a tit-for-tat play, capturing one stone and forcing White to strengthen the corner.];W[bs];B[cl];W[el];B[io]C[B117: Black encloses territory in no hurry.];W[eo];B[ep];W[ho];B[hp];W[in];B[ro]
