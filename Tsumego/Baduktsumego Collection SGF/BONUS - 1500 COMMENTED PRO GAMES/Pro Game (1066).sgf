Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[In the round 2 of 6th Chunlan Cup, Zhou Heyang 9p (Black) knocked out Cho Chikun 9p again following 2002 Chunlan Cup.];W[dc];B[pq];W[cp];B[ep]
;W[eq];B[dp];W[dq];B[co];W[fq];B[fp]C[Both are deep-thinking-type players, therefore the game process is slow but very tasteful.];W[gp];B[cq];W[bp];B[cr];W[bq];B[gq];W[hq]
;B[br];W[bo];B[gr];W[fr];B[hr];W[dr];B[cn]C[The lower-left large-avalanche joseki is a little different from the normal situation, if it forms a fight, it will be more to Black's advantage.];W[fo]C[So White starts to vary with W26.];B[go];W[hp];B[fn]C[B27 and B29 are correct moves.];W[ho]
;B[eo];W[ir];B[ds];W[es];B[bn]C[Through B35, locally Black has nothing to complain.];W[cf]C[But White gets to grab the excellent point with W36, White is also acceptable.];B[oc];W[qo];B[qk];W[pp];B[oq];W[qq]
;B[qr];W[rq];B[ic]C[B45: Black takes tenuki and plays positively. Black has no state of mind to make two-space extension at the bottom.];W[mq]LB[qi:a]C[W46: White starts to attack, it seems White should first invade at 'a', watching how Black to answer, then decide how to attack at the bottom.];B[mp];W[lq];B[op];W[oo];B[no];W[on];B[mm]
;W[ol];B[pi]C[But through B55, Black takes chance to defend his right side, White is being snubbed.];W[ar];B[ch];W[gm];B[fc];W[de];B[eh]C[Through B61, Black's opening is successful.];W[lp]LB[mk:a][oe:b]C[W62: If White attacks at 'a', Black will press at 62, White has no good follow-up tactic. But in the real game, White's play looks hasty. For White to reduce at around 'b' is better.];B[lo]
;W[ln];B[kn];W[lm];B[ll]C[As to White's direct attack, B65 and B67 are good moves for dodging.];W[km];B[nm];W[ql]LB[ko:a]C[W70: White should first play atari at 'a'.];B[kp]C[B71 is a good move, White couldn't counterattack.];W[jn];B[ko];W[jq]
;B[rl];W[qm];B[mn];W[pk];B[qj]C[Through B79, White gains nothing.];W[jd];B[jc];W[kd];B[mk];W[id];B[hd];W[he];B[gd]
;W[kc];B[ff];W[pg]LB[og:a][ge:b]C[The invasion of W90 is an overplay and can also be considered the losing move of this game! For White to reduce at 'a' is common. Even if White wants to invade this way, the exchange of W88 and B89 should be reserved, this way White can press at 'b' later on.];B[of];W[og];B[ng]C[B91 and B93 are sharp! The outcome of the game seems to have been decided instantly.];W[qe]LB[oh:a][oj:b]C[W94: Although White can escape at 'a', but after B 'b', White is difficult to look after both the right and the upper groups.];B[pd]
;W[nh];B[pf];W[mg];B[nf];W[qg];B[oh];W[ni];B[rh]C[Through B103, White is all being killed, Black is taking a big lead in territory.];W[jm];B[li];W[kk]C[W106: White starts the final attack, but since White itself is too weak and Black runs out safely.];B[oj]
;W[pj];B[oi];W[nj];B[nk];W[ok];B[qi];W[mh];B[kh];W[kg];B[jg];W[jh];B[ji];W[ih]
;B[rm];W[om];B[kl];W[ii];B[lg];W[kf];B[lh];W[mf];B[lf];W[me];B[ke];W[jf];B[le]

;W[ah];B[gi];W[gj];B[ai];W[ag];B[fj];W[bi]C[W166: White seeks a way to concede defeat, if White strengthens the center, White would still lose the game by a small margin.];B[ik]C[B167 is the killing move.];W[hi];B[gh];W[hk];B[hl]
