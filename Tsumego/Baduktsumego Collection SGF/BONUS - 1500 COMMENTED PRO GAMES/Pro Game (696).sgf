Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[Following last year, this year Gu Li and Choi Cheolhan meet again in this Korea-China Tengen confrontation.];W[dd]C[In the game 1 of best-of-3 series, Gu Li takes White.];B[pq];W[dp];B[fc]
;W[cf];B[kc];W[po];B[qm];W[ro];B[np];W[on];B[kq]C[The opening up to B13 is very popular recently. Generally speaking, most Chinese players like to take White in this opening.];W[pl]LB[qk:a]C[W14: For White to pincer at 'a' is also playable, but Gu Li likes to make the knight's move at 14.];B[qp];W[qo]
;B[pj];W[ql];B[cn];W[cl];B[od]LB[iq:a]C[Black first approaches the corner with B19, then protects the corner with B21, it is surprising. This sequence means perhaps Black is worried White will force at 'a'.
];W[co];B[dn];W[fq];B[hq]LB[iq:a]C[Black makes the extension with B25, it seems to force at 'a' is very important.];W[fo]
;B[fn];W[go];B[dl]C[Black attaches with B29 to dodge himself. Overall, Black gets one lonely group this early in the game, White should be favorable.];W[dk];B[ck];W[el];B[bl];W[dm];B[bk]LB[cj:a][bm:b]C[Black is a little inconvenient with the connection of B35, if Black extends at 'a', White may play hane at 'b' to initiate a ko fight.];W[bm]LB[cj:a]C[After Black retreats with B35, the hane of W36 is not that necessary. if White plays hane at 'a', White already should be happy.]
;B[bn];W[cm];B[eo];W[ep]LB[an:a][eq:b]C[The block of W40 is questionable. White should hane at 'a', next B40 and W 'b', this way White can fight.];B[am]C[After Black crosses over with B41, W36 clearly becomes a bad move.];W[em];B[en];W[gm]LB[cj:a]C[W44: White still should consider to hane at 'a'.];B[ci]C[After Black jumps with B45, White's attack completely fails.]
;W[bh];B[gn];W[hn];B[ch];W[bi];B[dj];W[hm];B[gi]LB[fe:a][ef:b][fj:c]C[Before Black sticks the head out, Black can consider to exchange B 'a' and W 'b', then jump to 'c', this way Black is simply favorable.];W[fe];B[cd]LB[eh:a]C[B55 is vicious. It is a good move locally, however its necessity is questionable, because after White makes the knight's move at 'a', the situation is very chaotic.]
;W[cc];B[bg];W[cg];B[ce];W[bf];B[de];W[ed];B[ef];W[eh];B[fm];W[fl];B[fj];W[dh]
;B[ej];W[gk];B[ff]C[After this move, it is time for lunch break.];W[gh];B[hh];W[gg];B[gf];W[hg];B[ii];W[ig];B[eg];W[fi];B[dg]C[Black cuts White in gote with B79 and B81, it is really vicious!]
;W[bc];B[gj];W[ji];B[jj];W[ki];B[kj];W[lj];B[li];W[kg];B[lk];W[mj];B[ge];W[jd]LB[ih:a][ij:b][kl:c][kk:d][lm:e]C[In this crucial moment, W94 is a slow move. White can only atari at 'a', next B 'b', W 'c', B 'd' and W 'e', killing Black strongly. White indeed doesn't have assurance of success, but to win the game, White has to play this way.]
;B[ie];W[ih];B[ad];W[bj];B[cj];W[ag];B[ij];W[je];B[jf];W[kf];B[if];W[jg];B[mk]C[Black obtains sente and presses at 107, the situation is clearly to Black's advantage.]
;W[nj];B[nk];W[eb];B[fb];W[hc]C[W112 is must. If White spends two moves to make life, the situation will be White's big defeat.];B[ec];W[dc];B[gd];W[ea];B[ae];W[af];B[ib];W[ld]
;B[ac];W[ab];B[bb];W[ba];B[aa];W[be];B[bd];W[ab];B[ic];W[mh];B[ho]LB[oj:a]C[The cut of B131 is unexpected. If Black bumps at 'a', Black will be favorable.];W[jm]
;B[io]C[The extension of B133 is a strong move, if White can connect together, the situation will be turned around. However, if calculating carefully, White really doesn't have any good tactic to connect.];W[kn]LB[lm:a][km:b][kl:c][kk:d][mm:e][nm:f]C[W134 is the key, if Black jumps to 'a', then Black can wedge at 'b'. With W134, if White peeps at 'c', then B 'd' and W 'e', Black has the tactic of attaching at 'f'.];B[lm]C[B135 is a good move against W134, White still can't connect.];W[lo]C[After W136, even if White can live locally, White still will incur a big defeat.];B[gr];W[bo]
