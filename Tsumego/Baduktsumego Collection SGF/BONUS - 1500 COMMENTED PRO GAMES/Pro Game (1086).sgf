Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[In the semi final of the 49th Korean Guksu winner section, Cho Hunhyun 9p the teacher meets his student Lee Changho 9p again, this is the 301st game between them in official tournaments.];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[fc];W[hc];B[oc]
;W[po];B[qo];W[qn];B[qp];W[rd];B[re];W[pn];B[nq];W[qe]C[The opening up to W16 is very common.];B[rf]LB[pe:a][qf:b]C[B17: Black starts to vary, if Black first plays atari at 'a', next W 'b' and B17, this will be a very familiar opening.]
;W[pd];B[qc];W[pc];B[qb];W[pb];B[pe];W[oe];B[qf];W[od]C[In the variation from B17 to W26, Black incurs a little loss in territory, how to use the thickness of B25's taking one stone is Black's task.];B[ld]C[B27 attacking White's thickness is Cho 9p's style.];W[fd];B[lg]
;W[og];B[oi]C[B29 and B31: Black attacks vaguely, this is also what Cho is good at.];W[lf]C[But the attachment of W32 is definitely to Cho 9p's surprise, since this is not like Lee Changho's style, so it appears Lee Changho is changing his style.];B[nf];W[of];B[kf];W[ke];B[le];W[mf];B[me]LB[ne:a][kg:b][ng:c][jf:d][nd:e]C[B39: If Black attaches at 'a', next W 'b', B 'c', W 'd' and B 'e', this way it forms an exchange, White is not bad for the whole game. In the real game, White appears very painful, but Black doesn't have any effective attacking tactic.]

;W[dc];B[de]LB[gd:a]C[B65: Since Black has no mindset to play atari out at 'a', Black has to sacrifice, but it is clearly territory-damaging.];W[fe];B[ce];W[db];B[ef];W[ff];B[eg];W[fg];B[eh];W[kc];B[kd]
;W[cj];B[bi];W[cn]C[Through W78, White is favorable for the game.];B[pl];W[mo]C[As to the attack of B79, following W80, White handles simply and clearly.];B[ko];W[ql];B[qk];W[rl];B[pk];W[rn]C[After White descends with W86, White's big group is basically alive.];B[fq]
;W[dr];B[fo];W[bj];B[em];W[dl];B[jj];W[gi];B[bc];W[op];B[mr];W[np];B[lq];W[fr]C[The settling pattern following W100 shows Lee Changho's strong point. His judgement is very accurate, Black is still difficult to give komi.]
