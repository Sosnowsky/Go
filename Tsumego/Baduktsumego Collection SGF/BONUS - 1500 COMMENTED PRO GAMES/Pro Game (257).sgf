Translation:GoGameWorld.];B[qd]C[In the final round of the 2003 Haomao Cup National Level A Team Competition, the game between Wuhan Team Li Zhe 3p and Beijing Team Huang Yizhong 6p becomes a heavyweight game, as a result Li Zhe won the game luckily and helped Wuhan Team to stay in Level A, however Zhejiang Team and Hebei Team sink into Level B together.];W[dc];B[dp];W[pp];B[ce];W[ed];B[ic]
;W[nc];B[lc];W[qc];B[rc]LB[pc:a]C[The variation of B11 is a good move, if playing at 'a' as joseki, the two-space extension of B7 seems over-concentrated.];W[pc];B[re];W[ne];B[qg];W[ci];B[dh]TR[ce]C[Cho Hunhyun likes to play the shoulder-hit of B17 very much, as for escaping the marked black stone, this is the best move and worth recommending to go players.]
;W[di];B[eh];W[ei];B[fh];W[bg]C[W22: White should first approach the lower-left corner.];B[cg];W[ch];B[df];W[bf];B[be];W[gc];B[cm]C[In the game, the large knight's move of B29 serves as an extension and also to attack White, Black is very comfortable!]
;W[le];B[ie];W[bc];B[gb]C[In most of cases, the attachment of B33 is beneficial rather than damaging.];W[fb];B[lq]LB[fi:a]C[The selection of B35 is unique, however turning at 'a' to press on White's big group is the vital point!];W[gj]C[White takes a breather after sticking his head out smoothly with W36.];B[mf]C[B37 is a bad move! Li Zhe originally aims to take a little advantage, but the double-sente move of W38 is inevitable, the peep of B37 becomes a big damaging move in a wrong place!];W[ld];B[kc]
;W[hh]C[After the knight's move of W40, Black sinks into a bitter battle. Before this game, Li Zhe has a high fever, this perhaps has affected his play.];B[gd];W[ge];B[hg];W[ig];B[he];W[hd];B[gf];W[fd];B[je];W[gg];B[hf];W[ff]
;B[gh];W[hi];B[fg];W[kg]C[When White makes the knight's sealing move of W56, in order to connect, Black's moves are almost dame, Black's situation has deteriorated further.];B[kf];W[lf];B[lg];W[kh];B[mg];W[og];B[oh]TR[kf]C[However nothing is absolute, the disadvantage now instead makes him wake up, stirring his strong and intense fighting will! The diagonal's extension of B57 (the marked black stone) can't be regarded as reasonable, the attachment of B63 also seems far-fetched. You can only win if you love fights, in this crucial moment, White makes mistake.]

;B[rf];W[qk];B[me];W[md];B[kb]LB[ke:a][li:b]C[B81 is a calm move, which prevents White from capturing at 'a'.];W[ng];B[li]C[In order to live, White allows Black to jump with B83, this move has a huge impact on White's outside thickness/thinness!];W[rb];B[sb];W[ra]
;B[pf];W[nf];B[pn];W[pl];B[ll]C[Next B89 and B91 are good tempo.];W[oo];B[fj]C[The crosscut of B93 is intense and painful! In the place where White originally is very thick, White instead is being separated and comes under attack, the situation has been turned around!];W[fk];B[fi];W[gl];B[hk];W[gk]
;B[dk];W[bk];B[ki]C[B101 is the key point.];W[ji];B[jj];W[ij];B[jh];W[jg];B[ii];W[ih];B[on];W[nn];B[om]C[After taking the chance to strengthen himself, B109 and B111 are severe!]
;W[nj];B[pi]C[Black's attack becomes more severe with the fighting. B113 and B111 are interesting moves, even they are all bad shapes but very practical.];W[qi];B[mi];W[qn];B[qo];W[po];B[qm];W[rn];B[rm];W[ro];B[pm];W[pj]

(;W[sl]LB[sh:a][sm:b][kk:c][qj:d][ok:e][mk:f][oj:g]C[W130 is the losing move! After Black captures three stones at 'a', the exchange of W130 and B 'b' is clearly damaging. With W130, White should directly extends at 'c', then B 'd', W 'e', B 'a' and W 'f' (see var a), comparing with the play in the game, there is no damaging exchange of B 'g' and W130, White takes advantage, this way although the game is still not so good for White, but White still can fight.];B[sm];W[kk];B[oj];W[ok];B[qj];W[oi]
;B[sh];W[mk];B[jk];W[kl];B[mn];W[ji];B[im];W[jm];B[mo];W[in];B[rq]C[The reason why W130 is a big damaging move is because when W146, the good move of B147 becomes effective!];W[rp];B[qq]
;W[qp];B[or];W[oq];B[nr];W[nq];B[mq];W[pq];B[pr];W[np]C[Through W158, White's big corner only lives with two points, the game for White is as good as lost. Overall, Li Zhe played very good in this game.];B[kn];W[kj];B[mb];W[nb]
