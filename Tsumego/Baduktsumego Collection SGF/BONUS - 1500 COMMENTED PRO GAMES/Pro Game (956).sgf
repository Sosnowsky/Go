Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[Lee Sedol and Choi Cheolhan are old opponents. On 5/8, in the quarter final of 40th Wangwi, Choi Cheolhan defeated Lee Sedol and advanced to the semi final.];W[dc];B[pp];W[dp];B[ce]
;W[od];B[oe];W[ne];B[pe];W[nd];B[pc]C[From the counter-approach of W6 to B11, White is a little damaging in territory.];W[dg]C[But on the outside there are three more white stones, it helps White in the fight following W12.];B[ee];W[fd];B[he];W[fe];B[ef]
;W[gf];B[cc];W[cb];B[bc];W[dd];B[cf];W[hc]C[From B13 to W24, the local variation comes to an end.];B[kd]LB[ic:a][nf:b][nb:c]C[The play of B25 is Lee Sedol's style, but now it is a little inappropriate, since the position of W24 is too good! With B25 Black should attach down at 'a' instead to take some advantage in sente and handle lightly, then taking the chance to play hane at 'b' or take territory at 'c'.];W[ng]
;B[lg];W[ni];B[pi]C[B27 and B29 look good but are far-fetched in fact.];W[kf]C[W30 is tic-for-tac, Black sinks into a bitter battle.];B[ic]C[The sequence following B31 is common tactic for dodging, if knowing this earlier, Black shouldn't play B25 and B27.];W[ib];B[hb];W[gb];B[hd]LB[jb:a][lf:b]C[B35 is rigid, Black should reserve the atari at 'a' and simply seek to turn the body around at 'b'.]
;W[ha];B[gc];W[jc]C[W38 is severe, for this ko, White is light and Black is heavy.];B[hb];W[cd];B[bd];W[hc];B[id]C[Black is forced to connect with B43, from here, Black becomes heavier and heavier.];W[hb];B[lf];W[kc]LB[nf:a][le:b][ke:c][kg:d]C[W46 is slow, White calls off his troop after seeing some good result. As a result, Black gets to wedge at 'a' and seek playing tempo. With W46, White should play hane at 'b' strongly, next B 'c' and W 'd', Black will face collapse.]
;B[nf];W[mf];B[of];W[mg];B[le];W[me];B[lc];W[ph];B[qi]LB[qh:a]C[B55: Black should tolerate at 'a'.];W[qh];B[qf]C[B57: Black is very inconvenient.]
;W[lh];B[kh]LB[kg:a]C[B59: Black also should retreat at 'a', Black's fight is unreasonable.];W[kg];B[jd]LB[li:a][ig:b]C[However, before B61, Black should first play atari at 'a', White gets to fix the shape at 'a' and 'b' from both sides, Black's three stones on the outside come under attack.];W[jh];B[ki];W[li];B[kj];W[ig]
;B[fc]C[B67 is an asking move.];W[ed]LB[gd:a][nb:b]C[W68 is strong. If White cuts at 'a' instead, Black will make the knight's move at 'b', Black can borrow strength from outside.];B[lb];W[nb];B[jb];W[gd]LB[ob:a]C[Black is reluctant to make the knight at 70, but after W72 Black needs to live in gote, and W 'a' is still sente, Black is being exploited terribly.];B[lj];W[nk];B[oh]
;W[og];B[oi];W[nh];B[rh];W[nm];B[mj];W[nj];B[km];W[no];B[nq];W[ko];B[fh]C[Just because of this, Black is reluctant to strengthen and instead starts to pound on White's thinness.];W[eg]
;B[fg];W[ff];B[bh];W[ch];B[cg];W[fi]C[Unexpectedly White counterattacks severely with W88 and W94, Black collapses completely. Afterwards, Lee Sedol totally loses fighting spirit and ends with a rare miserable defeat.];B[hh];W[ke];B[ld];W[hg];B[ja];W[eb];B[mb]

;B[jo];W[ip];B[jp];W[iq];B[gp];W[kq];B[dl];W[jq]C[In this game, Lee Sedol doesn't give a play to his talent. However, following B25, he seems to contend with Choi Cheolhan with personal grudge.])
