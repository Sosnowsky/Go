;B[ld];W[of];B[qf]LB[qg:a]C[It is hard to judge B9 and B 'a' which is good or bad.];W[pe]LB[od:a]C[W10 is to prevent Black from attaching and separating at 'a'.];B[qe];W[oh]LB[ic:a][qi:b]C[Now if Black plays at 'a', then W 'b'.];B[qi]
;W[id];B[lg]LB[lf:a][lh:b]C[The two-space jump of B15 is a good move, if Black plays at 'a', then White will cap at 'b', Black is not comfortable.];W[li]C[W16: Although White still caps, but White's shape is defective.];B[jg];W[oj]C[W18: White has to strengthen.];B[ng];W[og];B[ki];W[kj];B[ji]LB[fd:a][lj:b]C[Black first strengthens himself with B21 and B23, and also aims to invade at 'a', now for White to connect at 'b' is common.]

;B[ic];W[hb];B[hc];W[gc];B[hd];W[ge];B[ie];W[lb];B[hh]C[Through B105, Black makes life in gote and incurs heavy loss, White is favorable for the whole game.];W[cq];B[dq];W[kq]TR[ij][jj][kj][lk]C[White plays the splitting move of W108 and also indirectly supports the four marked stones.]
;B[mq];W[hq];B[mk]LB[qo:a]C[B111 pulling out appears a little slow, for Black to attach at 'a' and take territory is imperative.];W[qq];B[qr];W[qp]C[The timing of W112 and W114 is excellent.];B[or];W[ml]C[W116 is a good move.];B[ll];W[kk];B[nk]
