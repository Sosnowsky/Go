Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[In the title match 5 of the 49th Guksu, the challenger Lee Changho 9p easily defeated Choi Cheolhan 9p, winning the title back.];W[dc];B[dp];W[pp];B[ce]
;W[dh]LB[ed:a]C[The two-space pincer of W6 is rarely seen nowadays, the popular move is to make the diagonal at 'a'.];B[fe];W[gc];B[dj];W[fh];B[hd];W[gd];B[ge];W[he];B[ec]LB[eb:a][ed:b][fb:c][cc:d][db:e][gg:f]C[After White pushes and cuts with W12 and W14, Black attaches with B15, White is a little difficult. If White plays hane at 'a', next B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e' and B 'f', this way Black can be satisfied.]
;W[dd]C[White elects to exchange, it seems White incurs loss in territory.];B[fc];W[fd];B[ed];W[ee];B[de];W[ef];B[db];W[hc]LB[gf:a]C[W24 is a variation, the common move is to simply capture at 'a'.];B[cc]LB[gf:a]C[But in terms of the result, for White to simply strengthen at 'a' is better, since Black's capture of B25 is a valuable move.]
;W[oc];B[pe];W[gf];B[nd];W[mc]LB[cn:a]C[W30 can be reserved, to approach the corner at 'a' is imperative.];B[qn];W[nq];B[qj];W[qc];B[rc];W[pc];B[fq]
;W[rb];B[re];W[sc];B[ph];W[og];B[oh];W[mf]C[White again ends in gote and W34 and W44, White's speed is too slow!];B[qq]C[And, B37 and B45 these two moves are very big.];W[qp];B[rp];W[ro];B[rq]
;W[qo];B[or];W[oq];B[nr];W[mq];B[mr];W[pn];B[lq];W[lp];B[kp];W[lo];B[co]C[Through B61, Black already takes a clear lead. In the following process, White already has no chance at all, Black keeps the advantage of 15 points on the board till the end.];W[fk]

Lee Changho defeated Choi Cheolhan by 3:2 and  won Guksu champion.])
