;W[oc];B[np];W[qq];B[qr];W[qk]C[The openings from both sides are not conventional.];B[qg]LB[qm:a]C[The two-space extension of B11 is not consistent with earlier play. For Black to directly stand at 'a' is better.];W[pf];B[qf];W[qc]C[The exchange with W12 and W14 is not to Black's advantage.];B[qm];W[pd]
;B[qe];W[no]LB[rc:a]C[W18 attaching out to fight is Teacher Cho's style. In fact for White to stand at 'a' is already good enough.];B[mo];W[op];B[oq]LB[nn:a][qp:b]C[B21 can be regarded as a hint foreshadowing Black's defeat. For Black to play atari at 'a' is the only move, if White pushes at 21, then Black plays atari at 'b', this way Black takes complete control of the game.];W[mp];B[nq];W[nn];B[lo]
;W[qp]C[With W22 to W26, White takes lot of advantage.];B[rr];W[ok];B[nm]C[When White jumps to W28, Black can only attach out with B29, Black sinks into a bitter battle.];W[mn];B[pj];W[pk];B[on];W[oo];B[ml];W[kn]C[The jump of W36 is good move!];B[nj]LB[lp:a]C[B37: For Black to first turn at 'a' is a little better.]
;W[oj];B[ni];W[ph];B[pe];W[oe];B[pg];W[oh];B[of];W[nh];B[ne];W[kp]C[White checks again with W48, Black is very painful.];B[ri];W[lh]
;B[lj];W[qj];B[kh];W[lg];B[lp];W[lq];B[mq]C[Following B55, Black captures two white stones, but Black pays a dear price, White becomes very thick. The most important is, the left side still has one empty corner, now White is already clearly favorable.];W[ko];B[kq];W[lr];B[jq];W[ln];B[mp]
;W[ip];B[iq]LB[hr:a]C[In the process, with B65 for Black to make knight at 'a' is a little better.];W[hq];B[hr];W[gr];B[jp];W[io];B[gq];W[hp];B[is];W[fq];B[kg]
;W[lf];B[li];W[ll]C[W78: White is alert!];B[lk]LB[jo:a][in:b]C[With the exchange of W78 and B79, when Black pushes at 'a', White can retreat at 'b'.];W[md];B[nc]LB[rh:a]C[On the right side, White is still left with the tactic of making life at 'a'. Therefore White is not worried regarding the fight following B81.];W[nd];B[od];W[pc]
;B[me];W[le];B[ld];W[oe];B[jo];W[in];B[od];W[mc];B[lc];W[oe];B[jn]C[Since Black can't find ko threats, Black has to tighten his own liberty with B95.];W[jm];B[od]
;W[mb];B[lb];W[oe];B[je];W[jd];B[od];W[nb];B[im];W[jl];B[il];W[kr];B[jr];W[gs]C[Thus, following W110, White takes one stone B67 in sente. On the board, White has no weak point.]
;B[mr];W[hs];B[ls];W[ir];B[ks];W[ik]C[Following W116, the game completely enters into White's tempo. It is show time for Teacher Cho.];B[hk];W[jk];B[hj];W[ii];B[hi];W[ji];B[ih]
