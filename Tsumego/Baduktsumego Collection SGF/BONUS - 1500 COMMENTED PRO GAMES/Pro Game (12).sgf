Here (in duiyi.tom.com, a new internet Go server) a lot of go friends are all very active to enroll to participate in teaching games, the number has reached several hundreds, I'm really moved by such an enthusiasm: as a professional player, except playing games, there is too little that I can do to contribute to our Go cause...];B[pd]C[To our Go fans' satisfaction, today I'm playing two simultanous games.];W[dc];B[pq];W[dq];B[co]
;W[dl];B[ep]LB[eq:a]C[The knight's move of B7 is a very complicated joseki, in handicap games, White definitely can't think of crawling at 'a', which is a passive play.];W[dp];B[do];W[eo];B[dm];W[fo]LB[fp:a][en:b][cl:c]C[W12 is a play that will lead to a very complicated variation, here there is another way of playing: atari at 'a', B 'b', W12 and B 'c', this variation is too simple, from the surrounding configuration, White is a little dissatisfied.];B[el]LB[em:a][en:b][fm:c][fn:d][gn:e][dn:f][gm:g][dk:h][cl:i][ck:j][bl:k][bk:l][bn:m][bo:n][cp:o][bq:p][bp:q][ap:r][cr:s][al:t]C[The hane of B13 is strong and unyielding, this move needs a very deep calculation, because this will lead to a very many complicated variations, for example, White cuts at 'a', followed by B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f', W 'g', B 'h', W 'i', B 'j', W 'k', B 'l', W 'm', B 'n', W 'o', B 'p', W 'q', B 'r', W 's' and B 't', White will be captured.]
;W[dk]C[In the game, I have calculated several variations, after consideration, I elect to simply extend with W14.];B[en];W[gq]LB[fp:a][hq:b][fr:c]C[W16: White can also consider to reinforce at 'a', but I don't like it, because later on Black can force at 'b' and play the knight's move at 'c', Black would be very happy. In the game, the head is relatively soft, so this is also not perfect.];B[ek];W[dj];B[de]LB[cl:a]C[B19: Black should play the hane at 'a', this is the base and key point for both sides.];W[cm]C[W20 is huge!]
;B[fd];W[ej]LB[fi:a]C[W22 sticking the head out is very crucial, White definitely can't allow Black to play the knight-seal at 'a'.];B[gk];W[fj];B[gm]LB[fn:a][go:b][eb:c]C[B25 is very solid, but Black can also consider to exchange B 'a' and W 'b' then make the knight's move at 'c', this is a fast pace and nimble play.];W[ee]LB[ce:a]C[W26: White starts to move forward! In fact this is just a mock attack, here White doesn't have very severe tactic, because White's own feet are still not stable, White elects to attack in order to defend. If White reinforces simply with the attachment at 'a', from the state of mind, Black would be more relaxed.];B[ed]
;W[dd];B[ce];W[fe];B[eb];W[ec]LB[db:a][gd:b][fb:c]C[W32 is necessary sequence, if White simply blocks at 'a', then Black will reinforce at 'b', later on when White pushes at 32, Black will draw back at 'c'.];B[fc];W[db];B[fb];W[cd];B[bd]LB[be:a]C[Comparing B37 and the descent at 'a', both has their advantage and disadvantage, in the game Black's eye shape is rich. With the descent at 'a', later on White's corner can be killed by a ko.]
;W[bc];B[bf];W[bb]LB[ad:a][ae:b][ge:c]C[W40: White has no choice, White wants to atari at 'a', however Black definitely will initiate the ko at 'b', and Black has plentiful local ko threats at around 'c'.];B[ge];W[eg]LB[gf:a][he:b]C[W42: White is not willing to exchange W 'a' for B 'b'.];B[dg];W[fg]
;B[bh];W[kc]LB[jd:a]C[W46: As to handicap games, White should play at 'a' to exert more pressure on Black, the play in the game is too casual.];B[ic];W[nc];B[oc];W[nd];B[pf];W[dh];B[cg];W[qo]LB[qk:a][qi:b][qn:c][qh:d]C[W54 is a very simple and questionable move, White should play the splitting move at 'a', Black should force at 'b', then White approaches at 54, if Black defends at 'c', then White can make the extension at 'd', the position of the earlier corner-defending move (B51)is obviously not good.]
;B[ql]C[After Black plays the pincer of B55, White becomes very painful, of course, where to play the pincer is worth study.];W[pp]
(;B[oq]LB[qq:a][op:b][or:c][oo:d][qp:e][rq:f][pn:g][on:h][pr:i][pm:j][np:k][nm:l][mq:m]C[B57 is relatively weak, now Black should extend at 'a', If W57, B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f', W 'g', B 'h', W 'i' and B 'j' (see var a); If White jumps to 'k', then B57, W 'l' and B 'm', White is hard to choose his next move (see var b).];W[qq]C[W58: White gets a base and should be very happy.]
;B[qr];W[rq];B[lq];W[pi]C[W62: Now White has very difficult choice, in the game the light invasion is kind of asking move.];B[pn]LB[no:a]C[B63 is no good, Black should make the knight's move at 'a'.];W[op];B[np];W[no];B[mp];W[qn]C[Now we can see the exchange of B63 for W68 is damaging.];B[ol]
;W[qc];B[ob];W[qe];B[pe];W[rf];B[qf];W[re];B[qh];W[rg];B[ph];W[ke]LB[rh:a][qi:b]C[W80: White should first exchange W 'a' and B 'b', this makes a very big difference in territory.]
;B[rh]LB[qd:a][rd:b][qb:c]C[B81 is sente, If White tenukis, after B 'a', W 'b' and B 'c', White will die.];W[qb];B[ie];W[kh];B[li]C[B85 is a valuable move.];W[lh];B[mi];W[mh];B[nh]
;W[ng]LB[ki:a]C[W90 is no good, White should turn at 'a'.];B[ki];W[rl];B[rk]C[With the exchange of W92 and B93, White already takes advantage no matter what happens afterwards.];W[pm]LB[on:a]C[W94 is no good, now White should make the diagonal's extension at 'a', this way the game would be to White's advantage, in the game I feel there is a loophole here, the play in the game is careless.];B[om];W[pl];B[qm];W[pk]
;B[on]LB[oo:a]C[B99: Black should cut at 'a'.];W[qk];B[rm];W[rj];B[sl];W[sj];B[qj]LB[sk:a][rn:b][qi:c][ri:d][sn:e][sm:f]C[B105 is a good move, if Black connects at 'a', then W 'b', B105, W 'e' (notice White can't atari at 'c', otherwise B 'd'), B 'd', W 'f', Black is no good.]
;W[sk];B[ok]LB[pj:a][oi:b]C[W106: White can't connect at 'a', otherwise after the tiger's move of B 'b', the ko becomes very light for Black.];W[rl];B[eq];W[rk];B[dr];W[ni]LB[oh:a];B[nj];W[oi]LB[oh:a]C[Although W 'a' is thicker, but comparing to the game, there is a four point difference, White is reluctant to play such a damaging move.]
;B[jh]LB[iq:a]C[B115: If Black captures at 'a', the outcome of the game will be a small-margin defeat for Black.];W[jq]LB[oj:a][mj:b][nk:c][ji:d]C[W116: White wants to win the game at one stroke, but from the result, White is better to reinforce at 'a', Black captures White at the bottom, White can also play at 'b', 'c' or 'd', the result is still White's small victory.];B[ld];W[kd];B[oh];W[oj];B[lf]C[B117 and B121 are good move and very severe, reflecting 7d's powerful strength of duiyi.tom.com Internet server.]
;W[mf];B[le];W[lc]LB[nb:a]C[W124: For White to block at 'a' may be a little better.];B[kf];W[nb];B[ne];W[me];B[md];W[oe];B[of];W[nf];B[mg]
;W[lg];B[na]LB[oa:a]C[The hane of B135 is a good move, otherwise if White connects at 'a', Black's liberties would be worse a lot.];W[ma];B[oa];W[id]C[The wedge of W138 is intuition, at that time I also can't see clear the following variation.];B[hd];W[ib]C[The combination of punches of W138 and W140 makes White take a breather.];B[hb];W[jc];B[jd];W[je]
;B[jf];W[id];B[qi];W[pj];B[jd];W[if];B[jb]C[B151 is a good move! By having more ko threats, Black has neglected the existence of this ko.];W[id];B[si];W[sm];B[jd];W[mc];B[jg]
;W[id];B[qd];W[rd];B[jd];W[ia];B[ha];W[id];B[ri];W[rn];B[jd];W[od];B[pc];W[id]

;W[ig];B[hh];W[ih];B[ii];W[qg]C[Through 182, White finally captures Black.];B[bm];W[bl];B[bn];W[bi];B[ji];W[pg];B[og];W[ne]
;B[ci];W[bj];B[di];W[eh];B[ch];W[df]LB[ad:a][ae:b][be:c][ag:d][ah:e][ac:f][ab:g][af:h]C[W196: White should atari at 'a', then B 'b', W 'c', B196, W 'd', Black takes the ko, W 'e', B 'f', W 'g', B 'h' and W 'a', this way although it also leads to a ko, but it is now related to Black's well-being.]
;B[hg];W[pa];B[ad];W[ef];B[ei];W[fi];B[cf];W[gf];B[ff];W[cq];B[cr];W[gf];B[kg]
;W[mg];B[ff];W[er];B[bq];W[gf];B[gd]C[B215: Black gives way, Black should continue the ko fight.];W[hi];B[ff];W[fq];B[cp]LB[fh:a][fp:b][br:c]C[B219: Black has lost the best winning chance, if Black eliminate the ko at 'a', W 'b' and B 'c', Black would win the game!]
;W[gf];B[da]C[The ko threat of B221 is too small.];W[gh]C[After I take with W222, I am finally relaxed, now Black is very difficult to turn the game around.];B[cb];W[kr]C[W224 is a declaration of victory.];B[ir]C[B225 is the last probing move.];W[iq];B[hr];W[ho];B[es];W[fr]
