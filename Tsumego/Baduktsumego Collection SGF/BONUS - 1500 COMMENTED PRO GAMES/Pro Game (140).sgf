;W[cn];B[dr];W[qo];B[pm];W[cq];B[iq];W[jp]LB[on:a][op:b][om:c][pl:d][pn:e][ol:f]C[W12: As to the pincer of B9, normally White would make the knight's move at 'a', then B 'b', W 'c', B 'd' and W 'e'. As for the joseki, Black needs to spend one more move to make the extension at the bottom, then White can strike first on the right side, but now Black already has B11, Black could turn at 'f' to start pounding White, and there are black stones on both the left and right side, White is clearly unfavorable in the fight.]
;B[ip];W[jo]LB[on:a][oo:b]C[W12 and W14: White first wants get things into shape before jumping out at 'a' or 'b' to fight with Black.];B[po]C[B15: Black sees through White's purpose.];W[qp];B[pp];W[qm]LB[io:a][fo:b][jq:c][lp:d][kq:e][gp:f][gq:g][gn:h][qn:i][ql:j]C[White immediately pulls out with W16 and W18, it is over-hasty. Now to turn at 'a' is the vital point. If Black sticks his head out at 'b', White can block at 'c' right away, Black would be painful. If Black turns at 'c', White jumps to 'd', then B 'e', W 'f', B 'g' and Black seals off by the jump at 'h'. This way White not only would have compressed Black on the lower side and also built a white wall, even if Black makes the tiger's move at 'i', later on White is left with the sente move at 'j'.]
;B[qn];W[rn];B[pn];W[ql];B[rm];W[rl];B[ro];W[sm];B[rp];W[qh];B[nc];W[fc]LB[io:a][jq:b][gp:c][gq:d][gn:e][jn:f][hm:g]C[W30: White is in no hurry to defend the corner, White still should turn at 'a', B 'b', W 'c', B 'd' and W 'e', this is much bigger. Now White can't block at 'b', otherwise White would come under severe attack with the sequence of B 'a', W 'f' and B 'g'. Because Black has a thick wall in the lower right corner, there will be no big threat if White blocks down at 'b'.]
;B[jq];W[dj];B[im];W[km];B[jk];W[lo]LB[ll:a][kq:b][kr:c][lq:d][lr:e][io:f][ho:g][lm:h][ml:i][in:j][hn:k][jm:l]C[W36 is the right shape. If Black tries to kill White by playing at 'a', White has a good hane move at 'b', followed by B 'c', W 'd', B 'e', W 'f', B 'g', W 'h', B 'i', W 'j', B 'k' and W 'l', White would live unconditionally. Moreover when W 'b', Black can play at 'd' to destroy eye shapes tenaciously, but White can descend at 'e', because White can run out with the knight's move at 
'k', Black has no way to kill White.]
;B[cl];W[hn];B[gl];W[gp];B[gq];W[fm];B[fl];W[dl];B[em];W[dm]C[The sequence from W38 to W46 is a set of beautiful roundhouse punches. White has not only succeeded in strengthening himself but also indirectly threatens Black.];B[kp];W[lp];B[kq]
;W[lk];B[ok];W[ko];B[fn];W[io];B[eo];W[hk];B[hj];W[gj];B[hi]LB[ik:a][ij:b][mj:c][be:d]C[B59 is not good, after the hit of W 'a', Black has cut points. Black should bump at 'a', W59, B 'b', W 'c', then Black can ruin White's territory at 'd'.]
;W[ik];B[jj];W[gk];B[jl];W[mj]LB[hm:a][hl:b][il:c][jm:d][el:e][gm:f][gn:g][ep:h][fk:i]C[W64: White has missed a good opportunity. Gu Li said, White should immediately push and cut Black at 'a', followed by B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f', W 'g', B 'h', W 'i', B42 and W64. This way White would have gained advantage on the left side in sente and also separated Black, later on White and Black have to run out together, White's advantage would be clear.]
;B[gi];W[el];B[hm];W[en];B[gn]C[Black has connected safely with the sequence from B65 and B69, while building strength outside, what is left for Black is to chase and kill White. Thus Black instead becomes favorable for the game.];W[nm];B[ni];W[mi];B[nh];W[mh];B[ng];W[mg];B[nf]

;B[hc]LB[jg:a]C[However the ensuing move of B91 is a critical mistake! Black certainly should seal off White in sente by playing at 'a', forcing White to make life then making the extension on the side at 91. This way Black's territory would be bigger and Black is thick across the board, Black is easier to play.];W[jg]C[After White sticks his head out with W92, Black becomes thin on both the upper and lower side.];B[jf];W[ig];B[be];W[cd];B[ci];W[cg];B[cf];W[ch];B[ef]

;B[rd];W[qe];B[qd];W[rk];B[pj];W[sj];B[kc]LB[ej:a]C[B121 is no good, Black should squeeze at 'a' and capture White's four stones in the center by using White's weakness on the left side, which is the biggest.];W[fj];B[bc];W[bd];B[ad];W[cb]
;B[do];W[co];B[lq]LB[go:a][eq:b][ho:c]C[B129 is too small. Zhou Heyang said, he has overlooked that White can capture one black stone by playing at 'a' and 'b'. Now for Black to reinforce at 'c' is the right move.];W[ij];B[cc];W[dc];B[bb];W[go];B[fo];W[eq]
;B[fp];W[er];B[se];W[sf];B[sd];W[qf];B[fr];W[np];B[nq];W[le];B[jb]LB[bg:a][bh:b][ah:c][cj:d]C[B147 is a wrong sequence play. It would be better for Black if Black ataris at 'a', then W 'b', B 'c' and W 'd', after taking advantage, then Black plays at 147. In the game, alertly White gets to play the counter-sente endgame at 'a', Zhou Heyang is very regretful.]
