Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[pd]C[In the first game of Tianyuan best-of-3 final, the challenger Zhou Heyang 9p surprisingly gave away his victory to the defending champion Gu Li 7p.];W[dd];B[pp];W[dp];B[pj]C[Starting from the end of last year, Gu Li always plays sanrensei opening while taking Black. Zhou Heyang must have prepared for this.]
;W[nc];B[pf];W[kd];B[jp];W[hq];B[fc];W[hc]LB[ec:a][fd:b][df:c][ic:d]C[The pincer of W12 is normal, if White makes the diagonal at 'a', then B 'b', W 'c' and B 'd', White is not easy to answer.];B[cc];W[dc]

;W[mm];B[jn];W[jl]C[The cap of W30 is positive.];B[fq]C[The invasion of B31 seeks the tempo of playing.];W[ho];B[kl]C[Black attaches out with B33, it leads to a fierce fight.];W[km];B[jm];W[kn];B[hn];W[fp];B[kk]
;W[il];B[io];W[go];B[gq]LB[gn:a]C[The purpose of B43 is to obtain sente and press at 'a', but this move is very damaging, for Black to simply press at 'a' is better.];W[hr];B[gn];W[eq];B[mk];W[om];B[on];W[nn];B[nl]
;W[nm];B[ql];W[gl]C[W54: White unexpectedly gets to first attack Black's big group, it is not only to Gu Li's surprise, and all our observers also feel strange. So it seems Gu Li's selection following B43 is indeed questionable.];B[en];W[el];B[cn];W[dm];B[eo];W[cq];B[lr];W[or];B[pr];W[kq]
;B[jq];W[kr];B[bp]LB[ep:a]C[B67 is mistake! At any rate, Black should cut at 'a', this way Black would have many uses for other purposes on the outside, this variation is much better than the one in the real game!

After this move, it is time for lunch break.];W[ep]LB[fn:a]C[The connection of W68 is a good move! Next White can wedge at 'a', Black can't take care of both the head and tail, Black is very painful.];B[bm];W[bl];B[hl]C[Black has no choice but to wedge with B71, seeking a way of playing.];W[hk]LB[hm:a]C[W72: For White to atari at 'a' is also possible, the play in the game is also not bad.]
;B[hm];W[ik];B[ko];W[mr]LB[lo:a][ll:b]C[When B75, W 'a' is a good move! In this area, White has played many good moves. If Black pushes at 'a', Black can make the crude diagonal at 'b' to counter it.];B[im]C[B77: Black is forced to make eyes.];W[cm];B[bo];W[am]C[When White plays atari with W80, Black has only way to go, making a ko, but this ko is too heavy for Black!];B[an];W[bn]

;W[eg];B[dg];W[ef]LB[dn:a][kp:b][lq:c][ip:d]C[W98 is a big losing move! Now only if White pushes at 'a' to eliminate the ko, the game will be over. If Black still plays as in the game, B 'b', W 'c' and B 'd', White can retreat at 98. The play in the game equals Black obtains a counter-sente endgame of about 20 points in sente, White's loss is heavy.];B[bm];W[dn];B[do];W[bn];B[ij];W[hj]
;B[bm];W[di]LB[fn:a][fm:b][fo:c][gm:d][em:e][dl:f]C[In fact, over here Heyang made a severe miscalculation. He thought mistakenly, after White sacrifices five stones with the cut of W106 to make life, White still can wedge at 'a' and cut Black's tail, this way the cut of W106 is still a clever move, but he didn't expect, if he wedges at 'a', then B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e 'and B 'f', White will connect and die! This miscalculation is too severe, White is already in an inferior situation.];B[dj];W[bn];B[co];W[ci];B[cj]

;B[jd];W[ld];B[jf];W[ni];B[ic];W[og];B[of];W[qc];B[nj];W[oi];B[gg]C[B159 is a very "vicious" move, Black wants to attack White's two big groups.];W[ih];B[ge]
