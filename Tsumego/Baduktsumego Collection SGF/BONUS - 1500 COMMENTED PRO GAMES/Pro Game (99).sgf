No matter who wins the final game, he will be the world champion in reality as well as in name.];B[qp];W[co];B[nq]C[B5 protecting the corner with the large knight's move is Yoo 9p's favorite play.]
;W[qf]LB[qj:a]C[B6 at 'a' splitting the side is more common.];B[pi]TR[qp][nq]C[The pincer attack of B7 from this direction is certain, this fits the direction of development for the large knight's corner enclosure.];W[nc];B[pf];W[pg];B[of];W[qd]LB[qe:a]C[W12 is simple and clear, extending at 'a' will lead to complicated variations.];B[qe]
;W[re];B[pe];W[rg];B[qc];W[rd];B[og]C[The sequence up to 19 is common joseki, both sides have played very fast in this area, showing that they are all well prepared.];W[jd];B[ph];W[pc];B[oc];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb]C[Through 26, it forms a position of White's territory versus Black's outside influence.]
;B[ep]C[The approaching direction of B27 takes the consideration of the whole board's configuration.];W[dq]C[W28 is the most common response.];B[eq];W[dr];B[en];W[do];B[eo];W[er]C[Through 34, both sides follow their original fighting plan.];B[de]LB[gq:a]C[B35 jumping at 'a' is also possible];W[dg]C[The tight pincer of W36 is a positive play.]
;B[he]LB[fe:a]C[B37 is nimble, jumping to 'a' is usual.];W[jf];B[fe];W[jh]C[W38 and W40: White jumps consecutively to the center, although it somewhat contains Black's big moyo, but it may accomplish nothing.];B[gc];W[ce];B[cf];W[df];B[cd];W[be];B[dd]
;W[bd];B[cc];W[bc];B[bb]C[B51 is kind of sente.];W[di]LB[bg:a]C[W52 guards against Black's diagonal move at 'a'. So far, Black obtains sente and also makes a considerable territory at the top.];B[gq];W[oq]C[W54: White spoils Black's corner, it is a stylish play of O Rissei, but its timing is worth study.];B[op];W[pq];B[np];W[pp]
;B[po];W[qq];B[ro];W[rp];B[qo];W[nr];B[mr];W[or];B[rq];W[rr];B[sp];W[sr];B[jj]C[Through 71, top pros in the study room think the game already enters Yoo Changhyeok's tempo, Black is easier to play.]
;W[mq]LB[lq:a][lo:b]C[The cut at 72 is surprising move, White aims to initiate a fight here. White can also strike at 'a', after Black connects at 72, White can jump to 'b'.];B[lr];W[mp]C[It seems they have reached an agreement, they played very fast, seventy moves are on the board in less than an hour, this is rarely seen in the finals of world big events.];B[kp];W[mn];B[on];W[ko];B[jp];W[jo];B[jm]C[B81 is the vital point for attack, White is not comfortable.]
;W[io];B[hp];W[ip];B[iq];W[lp];B[lq];W[km];B[jl];W[kl];B[kk];W[ik]LB[ml:a][lk:b][ij:c][hl:d]C[W92: White strikes first and it makes sense, if directly jumping to 'a', after B 'b', White plays 92, Black can answer with 'c' or 'd'.]
;B[jk];W[ml];B[lk];W[mk];B[ll];W[lm];B[nm];W[mm];B[ok];W[ol];B[ke];W[je];B[lc]C[B103 and B105: Black takes tenuki to strike White at the top first, preparing to start a two-pronged attack.]
;W[mi];B[lh];W[li];B[nj];W[mj]C[So far, it is time for lunch break. Wang Runan 8p and Zhou Heyang 8p both think Black is better.];B[kh];W[ki];B[ji];W[jg];B[lf]C[Through 115, Black has some gains from the attack.];W[hh];B[gi]C[B117: Black attacks in order to defend. So far Black has the initiative. O Rissei starts pondering, both sides are obviously slowing down in this period. If White can not tackle the two weak groups properly, White's situation will be worse.]
;W[hi];B[gk];W[hj];B[hm];W[lg]C[W122 is very timly.];B[mh];W[nn];B[om];W[no];B[oo];W[lo]C[White has no choice but to live by W124 to W128.];B[rb]C[B129 is the tesuji for the endgame.]
;W[rc];B[qa];W[pa]LB[nb:a]C[Through 132, Black has prevented White from clamping over at 'a' with sente.];B[kc]C[B133 is a good move for attack and defense.];W[hr];B[hq];W[ek]C[W136 is very thoughtful move, the usual move is to connect back.];B[el];W[dl];B[fk]C[Through 139, White has gained a little.]
;W[gf]C[W140: White still wants to keep sente. Pros in study room including Chang Hao 9p have calculated that Black is leading more than 10 points, if there is no accident, Black wins for sure.];B[eg];W[eh];B[ef];W[fh]C[Through 144, White's shape is defective.];B[dm]C[B145 is a steady play under a favorable situation.];W[hb]C[W146 is a surprising move, Yu Bin 9p instead regards it is game-deciding move, White aims to probe Black before making himself completely alive as a whole.];B[gb]LB[hc:a]C[B147 at 'a' seems also possible.];W[ge];B[gd]LB[hd:a]C[After B149, because there is a cut at 'a', White unexpectedly can take tenuki.]
;W[cm]C[The tenacious hane move of W150 is working now.];B[dk];W[cl];B[ej];W[ck]C[Through 154, White has gained a lot of territory, but Black obtains sente.];B[hf];W[gg]C[Through 156, in the study room, Chang Hao 9p and Yu Bin 9p determine that even if White makes the pefect endgame play, finally Black still leads about 8 to 9 points on the board.];B[id]C[B155 and B157 are Black's priviledge.];W[dj]LB[gh:a]C[W158: White defends against Black's squeezing and cutting at 'a'.];B[rh]

;B[jn];W[kn];B[fr]LB[rf:a]C[It is difficult to decide that either B173 or 'a' is bigger.];W[ab];B[aa];W[mg];B[nh];W[kg];B[mf];W[rf];B[dp];W[cp]
;B[cq];W[cr];B[dn];W[cn]C[B181 to B185 are good sequence moves.];B[hg];W[ih];B[ek];W[gj];B[fi];W[gh];B[oa];W[ra];B[lb]C[Black gets to play the final big endgame move of 195, and Black's victory is within reach.]
;W[ni]LB[nl:a]C[W196 should first be played at 'a'.];B[nl]C[B197 is a good answer.];W[oj];B[nk];W[ho];B[go];W[sh];B[si];W[ka];B[la];W[od]
;B[ma];W[me];B[ne];W[ms];B[kq];W[md];B[le];W[ng];B[oh];W[hn];B[gn];W[hl];B[im]
