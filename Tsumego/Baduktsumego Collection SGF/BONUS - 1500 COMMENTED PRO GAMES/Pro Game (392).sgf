Copyright by gogameworld.com and weiqi.tom.com.]RE[W+6.5];B[qd]C[Black is Chen Yao Ye 5P of China. Last year it was the first time he entered into major international events, and he advanced to the final.];W[dc]C[White is Jo HanSeung 9P of Korea];B[pp]C[Chen Yaoye loves territory. In this game, he starts with his favorite star-and-small-point opening.];W[dp]

;W[qn];B[qo];W[pn];B[nq]C[The opening up to B21 is very common and can be seen in many games.];W[qc];B[rc];W[rd]C[W22 and W24 are also most common tactic at this situation.];B[re];W[pd];B[sd];W[qe];B[qf]
;W[rd];B[dd];W[cc];B[qd];W[eh]LB[op:a]C[W34: White can also attach at 'a' as ko threat. This ko is not heavy to both sides, so don't play damaging ko threats easily.];B[di];W[rd];B[pl];W[ql];B[qd];W[op];B[oq]
;W[rd];B[rn];W[rm];B[ro]C[B45: Black can't take ko. Otherwise White will have no hesitation to take one stone at 45, this is related to thickness and thinness of the whole game and very important.];W[dn]LB[qd:a][rg:b]C[W46: If White eliminates the ko at 'a', White also has nothing to complain even if Black hangs at 'b'. Since W34 and W40 are a little damaging, White wants to take some advantage before the shape is set.];B[bo];W[co];B[bn];W[bp];B[dm]LB[ej:a]
;W[po];B[pq];W[cm]LB[en:a]C[W54: White aims to create ko. If White simply extends at 'a', after Black takes the ko, White is difficult to answer.];B[cq];W[cp];B[en];W[do];B[cl];W[rf]C[W60: White finally detonates the "bomb".];B[qd];W[em]
;B[pe]C[B63 eliminating the ko is inevitable, it forms an exchange. In the upper-right corner, White loses one move, but in the lower-right corner, White gains at least one move. Earlier Black is a little favorable, now the situation is even.];W[dl];B[ck]LB[bl:a]C[B65 is strong. If Black descends at 'a', White will make two-space extension at the top very happily. White is leading in territory but has two weak groups. Now the key is, how Black to take advantage by attacking.];W[bm];B[mc];W[md];B[ld];W[nd];B[kc]LB[lc:a][hc:b][mb:c]C[B71's shape is loose, Black should connect at 'a', allowing White to escape with dame, then Black again forces at 'b', this way Black is easier to play. In the game, Chen Yaoye overlooks White's strong move of W72. Since White can clamp at 'c', Black is very difficult to attack effectively.]
;W[le];B[oj];W[ri];B[rh];W[mf]LB[pm:a][nn:b][qm:c][pk:d]C[The shape of W76 is too beautiful! Now Black has to attack the right side strongly. For example, the most common move is to hit at 'a', but White also has good answer. White can jump to 'b' instead of connecting at 'c', if Black cuts at 'c', White can push at 'd' to fight by sacrificing.];B[pm];W[nn];B[qm];W[pi]
;B[qh];W[pk];B[nl]C[B83: Black has no other choices. If Black continues to chase-and-kill, Black's losses will outweigh his gains.];W[ok];B[nm];W[nk]C[Through W86, Black's attack is not productive.

After this move, it is time for noon break.];B[lm];W[jp]C[After White extends with W88, Black's territory is not enough and Black's situation is not optimistic.];B[lp];W[ic];B[ib];W[hb]
;B[id];W[hc];B[ke];W[kf];B[je];W[lk]C[Through W98, White is clearly favorable.];B[ig];W[he];B[jf];W[kg]C[Now it seems Black fails badly in the attack and almost didn't gain anything.];B[gq]C[B103 is a typical game-deciding move.];W[hq]

;W[in]C[White's sequence from W104 to W118 is of favorable consciousness. The situation becomes close after this fight. But now White is very thick and still in control.];B[fj];W[ih];B[hh];W[km];B[mm];W[ii];B[hi];W[hj];B[jh];W[ji]C[White has a huge potential in the center, Black is very difficult to find a chance.];B[hf]
