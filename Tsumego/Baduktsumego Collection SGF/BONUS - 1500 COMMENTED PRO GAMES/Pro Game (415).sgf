Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[In Toyota Cup final game 1, Cho U defeated Lee Sedol by half point and is only one win away from winning the champion.];W[qp];B[dc];W[cp];B[ep]
;W[gp];B[en];W[cm];B[op];W[mq];B[qq];W[jq]C[The play of W10 and W12 is rarely seen.];B[pp];W[qo];B[pr]C[It seems Black can form the shape of B13 and B15 and should have nothing to complain.];W[qk];B[qi]
;W[pm];B[kc];W[ce];B[ed];W[dg];B[cq];W[bq];B[dq];W[bo];B[gr];W[fq];B[fr];W[hq]C[White first makes diagonal of W28 then W30 in order to obtain sente.]
;B[hr];W[od];B[pf];W[qc]LB[of:a]C[W34: White can also consider to attach at 'a', since White and Black on the right side are both very solid.];B[rc];W[pc];B[rb];W[mc];B[nf];W[og];B[of];W[me]
;B[qj];W[rj]C[The purpose of W44 is also to obtain sente. We can see Cho U's style of seeking speed.];B[pk];W[ql];B[ld];W[md];B[ri];W[hd]C[The invasion of W50 is the last big point.];B[kf];W[hf];B[cd];W[de]
;B[lg]C[B51 and B55: Black seals off White in sente and also gains some profit.];W[jd];B[kd];W[qb];B[lb];W[qe];B[re];W[ob];B[fc]C[The diagonal of B63 is the urgent point.];W[fe];B[iq];W[ip]
;B[ir]C[B65 and B67: Black plays wedge in sente and it is Black's privilege.];W[jp];B[el]C[Through B69, Black is slightly leading in territory.];W[be];B[bd];W[ad];B[ac];W[ae];B[bb];W[dk];B[fj];W[ek]
;B[fk];W[fl];B[dl]C[B81 looks like crude move, but in fact it is good move.];W[cl];B[gl];W[fm];B[gm]LB[dj:a]C[Black sacrifices two stones but is left with the tactic at 'a' to destroy territory.];W[em];B[ho];W[fn];B[hp]

;W[ci];B[ch];W[bh];B[jj]C[In the real game, Black is able to make knight with B119, Black is a little favorable for the game.];W[ok];B[nk]LB[oj:a]C[The clamp of B121 is strong move! If Black hangs at 'a', White's extension at 121 is just right.];W[pj];B[oj];W[pl];B[pi];W[oq]
;B[rp];W[ro];B[or];W[nq];B[pq];W[rq];B[rr];W[sp];B[sr];W[jk]C[The attachment of W136 is game-deciding move!];B[mj]LB[nj:a]C[Since Black is worried about White's ko tactic at 'a', Black elects to make compromise with B137.]
;W[kj];B[ij];W[lk];B[ki];W[ji];B[ii];W[li];B[kh];W[lj];B[mi];W[nl]C[From W138 to W148, White gains a lot and the situation is closer.];B[pk];W[dd]

;B[na];W[qa];B[pk];W[ba];B[aa];W[pj];B[jn]LB[jm:a]C[B183: Black gives up the ko fight since Black can't find proper ko threats. However, with B183 Black should play at 'a', this way White can't counterattack.];W[mk];B[nj];W[io]C[The push of W186 is good move!];B[lm]
;W[hn];B[ml];W[ll];B[mm];W[km];B[kn];W[im];B[jm];W[il];B[nm];W[go]C[Through W198, White takes a little advantage.];B[br]C[Now it is half-point game.]
;W[ar];B[bs];W[di];B[rk];W[rl];B[sj]LB[dp:a]C[B203 and B205 are small, Black should wrap up at 'a'.];W[jg]LB[ol:a][eq:b][er:c][dp:d]C[But the strike of W206 is mistake, White should simply settle the shape at 'a' in sente, next W 'b', B 'c' and B 'd', White hopefully can turn the game around.]
;B[if]C[The counterattack of B207 is good move.];W[jf];B[ie];W[je];B[lh];W[ik];B[id];W[ig];B[ic];W[ke];B[jh]LB[eh:a]C[Through B217, Black loses the tactic of ko-capturing four stones at 'a'.]
;W[eq];B[er]C[Now, Black's situation is a little favorable.];W[ol];B[on];W[po];B[oo];W[dp];B[he];W[ff];B[sq];W[rp];B[gq];W[fp]
;B[in]C[B231 is mistake.];W[kk]C[White connects with W232, Black most likely incurs one-point loss.];B[hj];W[hl];B[jr];W[kr];B[eh]LB[sl:a][lp:b]C[The exchange of B235 and W236 should be preserved. Black should simply connect with B237 and Black will win by half point. If White descends at 'a', Black's knight-strike at 'b' will be effective.];W[mf];B[mg];W[sl]
;B[pn];W[qn];B[lp]LB[nr:a][mr:b][ks:c]C[The strike of B243 is the last losing move! Since Black already makes exchange of B235 and W236, Black can only crawl at 'a', next W 'b' and B 'c', this variation is better than real game.];W[lo]C[After White captures B243 one stone, White's half-point victory already can't be changed.];B[lr];W[lq];B[ks];W[kl];B[ln]
