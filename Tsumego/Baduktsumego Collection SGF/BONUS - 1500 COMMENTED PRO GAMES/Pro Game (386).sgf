;W[po];B[pc]C[The sequence up to B7 is very common.];W[qq];B[dp];W[gc]LB[od:a][qj:b]C[W10 is a questionable move. White's most positive move is to make extension at 'a' or 'b'.];B[od]C[Black hangs with B11 and forms a good shape.];W[pp];B[oq];W[qr];B[qj]C[After Black makes extension with B15, Black expands his influence to both sides.]
;W[lq];B[qm];W[fq];B[cn];W[dr];B[lo]TR[pq][oq]C[B21 is situational judgment, treating the marked two stones lightly.];W[np];B[ci];W[fo];B[kq]C[The attachment of B25 is a planned move.];W[kr]
;B[lr];W[kp]LB[mr:a]C[W28: White can't atari at 'a' and allow Black to fix shape easily, inside White's influence, this can't happen.];B[jq];W[lp];B[eq]C[B31 probing White is a good move.];W[ep]LB[fr:a]C[W32: White doesn't want to descend at 'a' inconveniently and strongly counterattacks.];B[gq];W[dq];B[mr]LB[jr:a]C[But after the pincer of B33, the extension of B35 is working, White can't extend out at 'a'. In the real game, it forms an exchange, Black destroys White's side territory and White takes Black's corner, but Black scores in the exchange.]
;W[ck]LB[cp:a]C[W36: White can only invade and can't just capture small at 'a'.];B[cp];W[gr]LB[en:a]C[W38: White should seal off by playing the diagonal at 'a', forcing Black to make life painfully.];B[jp];W[nq];B[nr];W[ce];B[en]C[Although W42 is very big, but after Black jumps with B43, Black is not only alive and Black's shape also becomes thick, making Black's loss in the lower left corner very limited.];W[dj]
;B[eo];W[fp];B[eh];W[ei]LB[fj:a][gh:b]C[W48: White can't simply jump to 'a', this way Black will jump to 'b', if White jumps again, Black will follow and jump, since Black's influence in the upper right corner is big, this way Black can still hope to form a big moyo, White is definitely not good. In the game, Black puts more pressure on White with W48.];B[fh]LB[dh:a]C[The extension of B49 is inevitable. If Black retreats at 'a', White's hane at 49 is very severe.];W[dh];B[cc]C[When White cuts with W50, B51 asking White is light and clever!];W[dc];B[be]
;W[bf]LB[bd:a][di:b]C[When B53, White can't hane at 'a', otherwise after Black makes extension at 54 in sente, Black can cut at 'b', this way White is difficult to resist.];B[bd];W[dg];B[db];W[eb];B[bl]C[B59: Black doesn't live the corner, boldness of execution steams from superb skill!];W[cb]C[White can't tolerate and has to kill the corner with W60.];B[bk];W[rn]C[After Black crawls over with B61, White is very difficult and almost has no good place to play his next move, therefore White turns to the lower right corner to make the knight's move casually.]
;B[qn];W[qo];B[bb];W[da];B[cd];W[ac];B[bg]C[After Black obtains sente, next B65 and B67 and B69, this leaves some aji.];W[cf];B[af];W[bh];B[bi];W[cg];B[di]C[Then Black cuts intensely with B75!]
;W[fi]LB[ah:a]C[W76: White can only escape out one stone W48, once W48 is captured, Black can initiate a big ko by playing at 'a', White can't tolerate.];B[gh];W[gi]C[But White pushes from behind with W76 and W78, Black again takes advantage.];B[hh];W[ij];B[ji]C[B81 is a very powerful attack! White's several stones suddenly can't move.];W[oi]C[W82: White can only change tone.];B[jj];W[il];B[hj]C[But after B83 and B85, White's several stones in the center dies unconditionally, so far we can say the game is over.]
