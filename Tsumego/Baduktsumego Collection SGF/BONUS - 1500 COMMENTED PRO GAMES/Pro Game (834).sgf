;B[lc];W[ne]C[As to B7, the jump of W8 can be forseen, since Takemiya almost never take the corner at 3-3.];B[pf];W[kd];B[ld];W[le];B[kc];W[jd];B[jc];W[id];B[hc];W[ge];B[me]
;W[mf];B[md];W[lf];B[nd]C[Black first takes territory with B19 to B23, and watch how White to build his big moyo.];W[dj];B[fq];W[eo]C[The small diagonal of W26 is almost Takemiya's patent, he used this move many times in the past.];B[ho]C[B27 is a weird move, nobody ever played this before, Korean player's uniqueness is dare to play anything, this is also one of reasons why Go fans like to watch their games.];W[go]C[It is difficult to judge whether W28 is good or not, showing Takemiya's tenaciousness.];B[hp];W[hn]C[In terms of result, it leads to the original variation of B29, W28 and B27.]
;B[in];W[im];B[jn];W[jm];B[km];W[kl];B[ll];W[kk];B[lk];W[lj]C[Through W40, both sides are not willing to retreat, it forms a rare shape, as for the whole game's configuration, White is not bad. Next both sides will try to destroy each other's moyo, a chaotic fight can't be avoided.];B[lm];W[hm];B[mj]
;W[mi];B[ni];W[li];B[qq]AE[cj]LB[cj:a]C[Black's moyo is clearly bigger than White's, White can't enclose territory at 'a' and can only first destroy Black's territory.];W[jp];B[iq];W[mq]C[Both sides have no assurance of success.];B[ko]C[B51 is the vital point, guarding against White's cut.];W[qo];B[qm]C[B53: Black is relentless and wants to kill all white.]
;W[ql];B[rm];W[pm]C[White aims to mess up Black with W54 and W56.];B[rl]C[B55 and B57 are calm moves.];W[oq];B[lr];W[lq];B[kr];W[pn];B[qp]C[W62 and B63 are all the strongest moves.];W[nj];B[mk]
;W[ro];B[qk]C[Can't see how White to make life.];W[qc]C[W68 perhaps is an asking move under time pressure.];B[nh]C[In terms of B69, Black seems to feel "it is enough".];W[pr];B[qr];W[pc];B[cc]C[B73 is the safest play, if Black takes risk to invade, White may fight desperately.];W[cd];B[bd];W[be]
;B[dc];W[ec];B[bc];W[ed]C[W80: White wants to take sente.];B[bf]C[B81: Black probes White.];W[ae];B[ce];W[cf];B[dr];W[db];B[cb];W[fb]C[From W84 to W88, Black forces Black to make life and is very happy.]
;B[ad];W[de];B[cq];W[cp]C[Through W92, White's center territory is huge.];B[ab];W[nr];B[oo];W[np];B[os];W[ps];B[mr];W[nn];B[po]
;W[no];B[nm];W[lo];B[mn];W[mo];B[lp];W[eq];B[fr];W[rf]C[W110: White grabs the last big endgame, Black already has no chance to win. Black's losing cause is wrong situational judgement, Black thought he could win the game if he can kill all white in the lower right conrer, so B73 is over-steady, in fact, only if Black invades White's territory, Black may have a chance to win. This game shows the power of 'Cosmic Style', to use professional words, that is: if all die, then win the game.];B[re];W[qe];B[qf];W[rd]
