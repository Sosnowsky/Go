Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[pd]C[In the title match 1 of Guksu, the challenger Lee Changho takes White and faces Guksu of last term Choi Cheolhan.];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[fq];W[hq];B[qo]
;W[kq]C[W6 and W8 are Lee Changho's favorite plays, they are thick moves.];B[cq];W[dq];B[cp];W[do];B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[eq];B[cn]C[Black obtains territory with the sequence from B9 to B17.];W[fc];B[nc]C[After W18 and B19, it seems the game will be a prolonged war.]
;W[nq];B[oo]LB[qi:a]C[B21 is the original move, if Black takes the big point by making the extension at 'a', White certainly will cap with the knight's move at 21.];W[qi];B[qg];W[ql];B[bd];W[cc];B[cg]C[B25 and B27 are huge points.];W[bf]C[W28 taking territory is good judgement.];B[bg]LB[cf:a]C[B29 is the only move, if Black caps at 'a', White will crawl out at 29, Black doesn't have any good follow-up.]
;W[cf];B[df];W[ce]LB[em:a][dg:b]C[After White takes territory with W32, the knight's move at 'a' and the cut at 'b' becomes miai, White is certain to get one.];B[kp]C[B33 is an asking move.];W[jq]LB[lq:a][fo:b]C[W34: White makes compromise, if White retreats at 'a', Black probably will jump to 'b'.];B[eh];W[em];B[hc]C[B37 is the last big point.]
;W[id]C[W38: White has many choices.];B[hd];W[ie];B[he];W[if];B[jb];W[hf];B[fd];W[ed];B[ff];W[ii]C[In the game, the sequence up to W48 is easy and steady. Among them, B45 and B47 are clever moves to keep connection.];B[rj]LB[ri:a][qj:b][pj:c][pi:d]C[B49: Black gets to attack first, if White blocks at 'a' to counterattack, then B 'b', W 'c' and B 'd', Black will take advantage; If White presses at 'b', Black can take the chance to connect at 'a', White is reluctant to play this way.]
;W[qd]C[Since White doesn't have any good follow-up, White takes action in a hurry with the attachment of W50.];B[qc]C[B51 is a steady play, so far, both sides are acceptable in the exchange.];W[qe];B[pe];W[rc];B[qb];W[qf];B[pf];W[rg];B[rh];W[qh];B[pg]
;W[ri];B[rf];W[sh];B[rd];W[rm]LB[rl:a]C[W66 is a must, otherwise, Black can attach at 'a' to connect back home.];B[mp];W[mq];B[rn]LB[qq:a]C[B69 is also inevitable, otherwise if White attaches at 'a', Black doesn't have any good follow-up.];W[pn];B[po]
;W[qn];B[oj]C[B73 is good tempo.];W[pj];B[ek];W[dl];B[fb];W[eb];B[gc];W[ec];B[hh];W[ih];B[jg];W[ig]
;B[kd]C[After B75, Black takes advantage happily with the sequence from B77 to B85.];W[kf];B[gm];W[fl]C[Black reduces with B87, White is fighting strongly with W88.];B[fo]C[From B89, the first close-contact fight starts.];W[gn];B[dn];W[en];B[hp];W[fn];B[fr];W[fs]
;B[hr];W[ip];B[gs];W[es];B[ho]LB[fp:a][eo:b][io:c][hn:d][im:e][hm:f][il:g][gq:h][iq:i][go:j][ir:k][hk:l][hl:m]C[B101: If Black connects at 'a', then W 'b' and B101, Black is fine, next W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f', W 'g', B 'h', W 'i', B 'j', W 'k', B 'l' and W 'm' ...... Go fans and friends, please test yourself, Black will kill White by one liberty.]
;W[gq]C[W102 is a good move.];B[gp];W[fp];B[ep];W[eo]C[Through W106, it forms a ko, Black is a little dissatisfied.];B[io];W[fp];B[pk]C[Black has no other choices but to play the damaging ko threat of B109.];W[ok];B[ep];W[jo];B[jn]
;W[fp];B[ol];W[nk];B[ep];W[iq];B[ko];W[jp];B[kn];W[oi]LB[nl:a][gr:b]C[W122 is a mistake, White should turn at 'a', Black can't connect at 'b' to start the ko.];B[hm];W[fp]
;B[lg]C[B125 is the winning move.];W[ke];B[ep];W[gr];B[pl];W[qk];B[nj]C[Therefore Black escapes with B131, Black initiates a fight.];W[mk];B[on];W[mi]LB[ro:a][rp:b][ni:c]C[W134 is the losing move. In this crucial moment, Lee Changho suddenly lost his speed. Now at any rate, White should atari at 'a', if Black counter-atari at 'b', then W134, White would be a little better than the real game; If White turns at 'c', then the game will be decided by this final life-and-death fight.]
;B[qm];W[pm];B[om];W[qm]C[From B135 to W138, Black is very happy with the sente moves.];B[ro];W[qj];B[nh];W[ni];B[lj];W[li];B[or];W[kc]LB[ld:a]C[W146 is a mistake, White should simply hane at 'a'.]
;B[lc];W[ld];B[md]C[B147 and B149 are good moves for settling the shape. In this situation, Black is leading about 10 points on the board. Black concedes defeat.

The title game 2 will take place on 2/14.])
