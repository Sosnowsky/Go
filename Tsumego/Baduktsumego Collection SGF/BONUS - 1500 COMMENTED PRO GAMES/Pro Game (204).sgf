(;SZ[19]EV[8th LG Cup round 1]DT[2003-06-17]PC[Seoul, Korea]KM[6.5]PB[An YoungGil]BR[5p]PW[Chang Hao]WR[9p]RE[W+R]C[Copyright by gogameworld.com and weiqi.tom.com.];B[pd]C[Black is An YoungGil 5p of Korea.];W[dd]C[White is Chang Hao 9p of China.];B[pq];W[dq];B[cf]C[B5: For Black to approach the corner in this direction is Chang Hao 9p's favorite play, it is obvious that An 5p has already studied Chang Hao's games.]
;W[fc];B[co]C[The opening to B7 is not often seen.];W[cj];B[cd];W[cc];B[bc];W[ce];B[bd];W[de];B[be];W[cb];B[ch]LB[df:a][dg:b][eg:c]C[After B17, if W 'a', B 'b' and W 'c', Black's shape is not good.]
;W[dm];B[en];W[ep];B[em]LB[bg:a]C[After B21, because White can make use of a move at 'a', it seems White's tempo is better in this area.];W[cp];B[dl];W[ej];B[df]C[B25 is a thick play for strengthening Black himself.];W[gj]LB[hc:a][qo:b]C[W26: White again jumps to the center patiently, it conforms to the Go theory, but right away Black is left with good points at 'a' and 'b'. ]
;B[bo];W[iq];B[qo];W[bl];B[cm]C[The exchange of W30 and B31 makes Black uncomfortable.];W[qf]LB[nc:a]TR[df]C[W32 is the right direction to approach the corner, due to existence of the marked black stone, the potential for White's development at the top is already constrained.];B[qh]C[With the tight pincer of B33, both sides have reached a common understanding: the top is "scatter".];W[nc];B[pf];W[qc]
;B[qd];W[pc];B[od];W[rc];B[kq]LB[gq:a]C[B41 is the biggest point on the board, after B41, the invasion at 'a' becomes possible.];W[bp]LB[io:a]C[The block of W42 is not good, White should jump to 'a'. In the game, Black starts first to attack White, Black is favorable.];B[jo];W[ho]C[W42: White is patient, protecting his own territory and separating the left and right black groups as well.];B[hm]
;W[ij];B[hp];W[ip];B[io];W[go];B[fk];W[fj];B[jk]C[B53: Black seems to have miscalculated.];W[pl]C[The invasion of W54 is imperative.];B[pj];W[pn];B[qn]
;W[mm];B[mo];W[il]C[W60: White counter-attacks, Black is difficult to answer.];B[km];W[nk];B[hr];W[hq];B[gq];W[gp];B[ir];W[gr];B[fq];W[fr]
;B[rd]C[B71 is too slow, Black should make the diagonal extension at 'a' to attack the four white stones and enclose territory at the same time.
After this move, it is time for noon break.];W[im];B[bm];W[op]C[W74 is White's game-deciding move.];B[po]C[B75 is too weak, Black certainly should cross-cut at 'a'.]LB[oo:a];W[oo];B[oq];W[mp];B[lo]C[So far, Black on the whole board has 40 points, White has about 35 points, the komi becomes a heavy burden for Black.];W[on]C[W80 is a thick play.]
;B[nq];W[qm]C[After Black hangs at 82, the game has been turned around.];B[lc]C[B73: Black aims to initiate a fight, so far White takes the lead.];W[ic];B[me];W[nb];B[nj];W[pp];B[qp];W[qq];B[rq];W[qr]
;B[rr];W[rn];B[so];W[qj]C[W96: White starts to make life.];B[qi];W[rj]LB[pk:a][oj:b][mk:c]C[W98 is a mistake, due to a favorable consciousness, White becomes conservative. White now should bump at 'a', White would connect at 'b', then W 98, Black can no longer play the atari at 'c'.];B[ok];W[ol];B[mk]
;W[nl]C[W102: White has no choice but to connect, Black has scored in this area.];B[sc];W[sb];B[sd];W[ra];B[ri];W[np];B[mq];W[mj];B[lk];W[rl];B[mi];W[kd]C[White shows a strong confidence in his own territory.]
;B[ld];W[ke];B[ff];W[jr];B[jq];W[hs];B[kr];W[mf]LB[is:a]C[The attachment of W122 is inexplicable! It is small, White certainly should take two stones at 'a', it is worth about 15 points, White would be favorable.];B[le];W[lf];B[kf]C[B123 and B125 are fierce, White perhaps lacks preparation for its severeness.]
;W[kg];B[jf];W[lh];B[gc];W[gb];B[fd]LB[hb:a][hc:b][gd:c][fb:d][dc:e][db:f][ib:g][ih:h]C[B129 and B131 are feint moves. W131 at 'a' would be better, followed by W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 'e', W 'f' and B 'g', Black can make himself thick by sacrificing two stones, then jump to 'h', initiating a severe attack on White. Even if White could manage to make life, White would be still losing.]
;W[ec];B[ig];W[ji];B[qk]C[Black starts to pound on White's thinness.];W[rk];B[ik];W[hl];B[jh];W[li];B[hk];W[gk];B[gl];W[gm]
;B[fl]C[White in the center becomes dangerous.];W[ii];B[di];W[gg];B[hc];W[hb];B[id];W[ek];B[ck];W[jc];B[gf];W[dj];B[bk]
;W[lj];B[ni];W[jg];B[if];W[kk]C[W162 is the clever play to get out of trouble.];B[jl];W[of]LB[ll:a][js:b]C[W164: White aims to extend time in byo-yomi, but White should first take at 'a', Black would also take at 'b', then White still can play at 164.];B[oe];W[og]C[W166 is a mistake.];B[kj]C[B167 is the killing move, Black grabs the final chance.]
;W[ih];B[mh];W[mg];B[hg];W[qg];B[pg];W[ph];B[pe];W[oh];B[pi];W[rf];B[sg];W[rg]
;B[re];W[sf];B[sh]C[B183 seems steady, but it is the losing move. Black should wedge at 'a' first, then reduce liberties at 'b', Black would win the capturing race.]LB[nf:a][rh:b];W[ne]C[W184 is the vital point.];B[nd];W[nf];B[nh];W[oi];B[oj];W[ki]
;B[jj]C[But B191 is the last losing move! Black should first push at 'a', White would take at 191, then B 'b', W 'c' and Black pushes at 'd', this way White has 9 liberties plus one ko, what's the most important is that Black can first play at 'e' to extend one more liberty, so Black would have won the capturing race.]LB[hj:a][ll:b][gi:c][hi:d][md:e];W[hj];B[ei];W[ll];B[kl];W[lb];B[kc];W[jd]
;B[kb];W[md];B[mc];W[mb];B[qe];W[jb];B[ka];W[ja]C[Black is one liberty short in the capturing race. 
The second round will take place on 6/19.])
