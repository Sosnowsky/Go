;W[cf];B[kc];W[qk];B[qm];W[qh];B[qf];W[oh];B[qi]C[B13 was never seen, it is perhaps Teacher Liu's unique "hidden weapon".];W[qg];B[of];W[pi]LB[qj:a]C[Since the shape of W16 is beautiful, Black shouldn't be satisfied with B15, Black has the state of mind to seek fight strongly by playing at 'a'.]
;B[fq];W[hq]C[Black on the right side is thin, the direction of W18 is correct.];B[cq];W[dq];B[cp];W[do];B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[eq];B[cn];W[kq];B[po]
;W[ic]C[W30 and B29 are two good points, Black can't take care of both, White's opening is successful.];B[ke]LB[dc:a]C[B31: Normally Black will play at 'a', in the real game Black focuses on enclosing the top territory, it is also playable.];W[dc];B[hd];W[id];B[ie];W[gb]C[W34 and W36 are good tesujis for connection!];B[jd]LB[fb:a]C[B37: If Black blocks crossover at 'a', White can push up, Black can't stop it. In the real game, the play is roughly acceptable, the situation is about even.];W[hc]
;B[gd];W[fb];B[mq]LB[pg:a]C[Of course B41 is very big, but for Black to probe White at 'a' is better.];W[rf];B[re];W[pf]C[W42 and W44: White is alert!];B[pe];W[qe];B[fr];W[qf];B[pd]C[Since Black is not favorable in ko threats, Black is forced to retreat with B49, Black's loss is huge. In this kind of unexpected place, to find some tactics is just what Teacher Ma is good at.]
;W[fs];B[iq]C[B51 is a common tesuji for the shape at the bottom, but generally when the surroundings are thick. In the game, Black pulls out directly, perhaps Teacher Liu feels his situation is not optimistic!];W[ir];B[gs];W[es];B[hr];W[ip];B[fp];W[dn];B[cm];W[fn];B[go]LB[hn:a][ho:b]C[B61 can be considered as losing move! If Black sees the good move of W 'a', then with B61 Black should play at 'b'.]
;W[hn]C[After W62, Black is difficult to stick head out and sinks into a bitter battle.];B[gn];W[gm];B[ho];W[io];B[hp];W[jq];B[hm];W[in];B[fm];W[gl];B[en];W[dm]
;B[fl];W[cl]C[B75: Although Black manages to escape, but White takes chance to take some valuable points, for example W68 and W76, Black's loss is very big.];B[gk];W[hl];B[im]C[B79 is game-deciding move, and it is somewhat unreasonable.];W[hk];B[fk];W[bl];B[bo];W[ej];B[jm];W[hj]
;B[gi];W[di]C[W84 and W88: White tries to settle the pattern simply.];B[eh]C[B89: On the other hand, Black tries to mess up the situation.];W[mp];B[nq]LB[hi:a][kk:b]C[B91 is too unreasonable! After White presses at 'a', Black's shape is bad, with B91 Black can only make the knight's move at 'b' to first attack White lonely stones in the center.];W[hi];B[kj];W[gh];B[fi];W[km]
;B[jk];W[kl];B[jl];W[hf]C[White first handles well the lower side with W96 and W98, at the top with the strike of W100, White is not difficult to handle.];B[dh];W[ch];B[ci];W[bi];B[cj];W[dj];B[cg];W[bh];B[bg]
;W[bf];B[if];W[ig]C[After the hane of W112, Black can hardly move.];B[df];W[ag];B[dg];W[de];B[bj];W[ah];B[ce];W[be];B[af];W[ae]
;B[cd];W[bd];B[cc];W[bc];B[jg];W[jh];B[kn];W[ln];B[lo];W[em];B[fo];W[ef];B[gq]
;W[ko];B[jn];W[mo];B[ih];W[hg];B[ji];W[he];B[kh];W[hh];B[iq];W[lp];B[jo];W[hq]
;B[cb]C[B149 is a "blind" ko threat! It is clearly a big mistake. However, even if Black makes life, Black's territory is still not enough.];W[iq])
