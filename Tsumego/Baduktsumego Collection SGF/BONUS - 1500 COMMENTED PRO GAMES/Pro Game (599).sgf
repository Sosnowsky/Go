Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[In the title match 3, Takao Shinji took White and defeated Cho U by resignation, therefore leading best-of-7 series by 3:0 and sending Cho U to a dire strait.];W[dd];B[pp];W[dq];B[do]
;W[co];B[cn];W[cp];B[fc];W[cf];B[dm];W[fq];B[ci]C[The opening through B13 is a typical Korean style.];W[oc];B[ld];W[oe];B[pf];W[qc]C[W16 and W18: White elects to play an ancient joseki.]
;B[rc];W[qb];B[pd];W[od];B[mc]LB[qi:a][lb:b]C[B23 is strong and unyielding, a fierce fight is imminent. The common move is to make extension at 'a', next W 'b', this way both sides are stable.];W[me]LB[qh:a][of:b]C[W24 is a calm move, if White directly forces at 'a', Black will attach at 'b', White's shape is not good.];B[kf]C[Black continues to chase and attack with B25, it is intense! But White itself has plenty of eye space and is not easy to be attacked, this way Black takes a very big risk.];W[qh]
;B[og];W[mg];B[oi];W[qk];B[qm];W[lh];B[ok];W[pl]C[After this move, it is time for lunch break.];B[rh]C[The attachment of B35 is a clever move.];W[rg]
(;B[qi]LB[ri:a][qg:b][rf:c][rj:d][qf:e][qe:f][qj:g][rd:h]C[But next the hane of B37 is a little questionable. Black should extend at 'a', next W37, B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', Black connects, W 'f', B 'g' and W 'h', leading to an exchange (see var a). Black gains a lot on the right side, however White also gets some compensation by invading at the top.];W[ri];B[rj];W[qj]C[W40 is a strong move, the following sequence is one way street.];B[si]
;W[pi];B[ri];W[ph];B[oh];W[qg];B[rk];W[oj];B[nj];W[pj];B[pm]LB[rl:a]C[Black wants to guard against White's hane at 'a', so he has no choice but to play the big crude move of B51, White is very happy.];W[ol];B[mi]
;W[ml];B[mk];W[ll];B[kj];W[om];B[ql];W[jh];B[id];W[np];B[pq];W[db]C[W64: White obtains sente and gets to protect the corner, Black completely fails in this fight.];B[nk];W[pk]
;B[lp];W[mp];B[lq];W[pn];B[qn];W[lo];B[ko];W[ln];B[on];W[nn];B[nr]C[After this move, the game was closed for the first day.];W[bj]C[White destroys territory by invading with W78, Black can't tolerate and has to counterattack.]

;W[eh];B[bb];W[ei]C[However through W94, White is very thick on the board, Black has three weak groups (in the lower right corner, on the right side and at the top), it is really difficult to handle all of them.];B[ep];W[eq];B[bo]LB[fe:a]C[B97: Black can only strengthen at 'a' on the upper side.];W[kb]C[W98 is fierce and cruel! It is the winning move for the game!];B[jc];W[mb];B[cc];W[dc]
;B[fe];W[gf];B[lb];W[la];B[kc];W[lc];B[bm]C[B109: Black takes tenuki strongly.];W[hc]C[W110: White delivers the final blow!

;B[ga];W[ha];B[lb];W[nh]C[White plays the ko threat of W144, Black can't answer any more.];B[ji];W[kg];B[lf];W[ng];B[lc];W[nb];B[nc];W[ni]C[White cuts and captures several stones with W152, White establishes his superiority.]
