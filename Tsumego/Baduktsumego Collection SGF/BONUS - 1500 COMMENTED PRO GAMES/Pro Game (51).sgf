Copyright by gogameworld.com and weiqi.tom.com.]RE[B+R];B[qd]C[Today we can completely relax and enjoy the game, hope Chinese players give us more of this kind of chances.];W[dd]C[As I know, both players are good at taking White.];B[pq];W[dp];B[fc]
;W[cf];B[kc]C[B1, B3, B5 and B7 are Gu Li's favorite opening.];W[po]C[As to the corner-approach of W8, Black has many choices, the most common answer is two-space high pincer and one-space low pincer.];B[qo];W[qn];B[qp];W[pn];B[nq];W[qj];B[db];W[fq];B[bp]LB[ck:a][ci:b]C[B17: Normally Black will first split at 'a', after White forces with two-space extension at 'b', then B17.]
;W[bn]C[In the real game, White has a strong state of mind to block with W18.];B[ch]C[B19 is a very nimble move, Black indeed is very hard to answer in the lower-left corner, at any rate Black will be taken advantage, this move is very thoughtful.];W[dn];B[eh];W[fd];B[gd];W[fe];B[hd];W[cc]C[Through W26, both sides have obtained some profit. However, I think, since White's corner is still not clean, Black is not bad, at least the combination of B17 and B19 is effective.];B[qh];W[lq];B[cq]LB[dr:a][dq:b][er:c]C[The play of B29 is good timing, if playing it later, White can jump to 'a', when B 'b', White can retreat at 'c' to kill strongly. However, now because of the outside configuration, even if White kills, it is not to White's advantage.]
;W[dr];B[dq];W[eq];B[cr];W[er];B[bo];W[cm]LB[gh:a]C[W36 is a little inexplicable, originally White has so many sente moves in this area, why not directly cap at 'a'? The only explanation may be that, later on the corner becomes smaller and White can't play W36 anymore.];B[br];W[gh];B[gf]LB[fg:a]C[As to the probe of B39, White is definitely reluctant to make diagonal back at 'a', this way White is very inconvenient. In this area, they surprisingly start to fight, but in terms of shape, White looks far-fetched.]
;W[ec];B[eb];W[ge];B[he];W[hf];B[hg];W[if];B[gg];W[fg];B[ff];W[eg];B[ef];W[df]
;B[fh];W[dg];B[gi];W[gc];B[fb];W[ie];B[hc];W[hh];B[ig];W[hi]C[This fight is the key for this game, since Black has more territory, White has to take advantage by attacking.];B[dh]C[Xie He is meditating ...];W[bg]
;B[gj];W[hj];B[ee];W[ed];B[jg]LB[ej:a][gk:b][hk:c]C[Through B69, Black tries all he can to take territory, now White can only attack at the maximum limit. Now White has many choices, for example, to play at 'a', 'b' or 'c'.];W[hk]C[After pondering for a long time, Xie He plays W70.];B[ej]C[After Black strengthens with B71, Black is basically alive.];W[kd]C[W72 is good move, three useless stones now come to life, another round of fight starts again, so far the game is very brilliant.]
;B[lc];W[jc];B[id]C[Now the situation is very complicated. White takes advantage in the exchange from W72 to B75, here shows Xie He's sharpness.];W[qf];B[od];W[kf];B[jd];W[cj];B[bh];W[cb];B[bk]C[B83 is tesuji, White can't take any advantage.

Now the exchange of W36 and B37 looks even bad.];W[bj]
;B[ck];W[ak];B[bl];W[al]C[Now Black is relatively easy to play.

After this move, it is time for noon break.];B[gk];W[gl];B[fl];W[fm];B[dk]C[Through B93, White takes some advantage in points, but White's center becomes thin, White's losses outweigh his gains.];W[pg];B[kg];W[mf]
;B[mh]C[So far, Gu Li plays very smoothly.];W[ph]LB[ng:a][jf:b]C[W98: Normally White connects back at 'a', Black will push and capture three stones at 'b', this way White in the center and on the right side is all defective, Black is clearly easy to play.];B[nf];W[ne];B[of];W[oe];B[pe];W[nd]C[Through W104, locally they start to exert power again, but clearly Xie He is fighting desperately.];B[nc]LB[pf:a]C[B105: If connecting at 'a', Black takes a big risk, in the game Black elects to play steadily.]
;W[oc];B[md];W[me];B[pd];W[ng];B[pf];W[lh]C[The sequence from W106 to W112 is played very fast, both sides should already have calculated clearly the variations.];B[ji];W[li]C[After hesitating for a while, Gu Li still jumps with B113, White plays W114 very fast.];B[le]C[B115 is important order, tightening White one more liberty.];W[lf];B[jf]
;W[ke];B[je];W[nh]C[W120 is necessary, otherwise Black can push out.];B[qg]C[After B121, it forms an intense capturing race, the game will be decided here at one stroke.];W[nb];B[mc];W[pb];B[pc]LB[qb:a]C[B125 is a big bad move, tightening one of his own liberties, for Black to attach at 'a' is just fine. If Black loses the game, this will be the losing move.
];W[ob];B[qb];W[rf]
;B[pi];W[oi];B[qi];W[pj];B[oj];W[mi];B[rj];W[rk];B[ri];W[mb];B[jb];W[rg]C[Through W140, there seems to be a loop hole in the upper-right corner, originally with B121 for Black to reduce at the bottom is just fine, now it is time to test Black.

After W140, Gu Li goes into meditation.];B[qk]
;W[rc];B[rd];W[rb];B[qc];W[qa];B[ra];W[pa];B[se];W[sa];B[sc];W[pk];B[ql];W[re]
;B[rh]LB[sf:a][sg:b][sh:c][sj:d]C[High hands predict there will be a complicated ko fight here.

With B155 if Black crawls at 'a', next W 'b', B 'c' and W 'd', White has the good tactic of capturing Black from behind.];W[sf];B[pl]C[B157 is steady, if directly initiating the ko, Black will collapse right away.];W[sd];B[lg];W[mg];B[se];W[og];B[sh]
;W[sd];B[be];W[bf];B[se];W[ok];B[ol];W[sd];B[ag]LB[nk:a]C[B171: Black wants to take at 'a', this way Black is not bad.];W[af];B[se];W[nk];B[sk]
;W[sd];B[de];W[ce];B[se];W[rl];B[rm];W[sd];B[ca];W[ba];B[se];W[sj];B[sl];W[sd]
;B[hl];W[qe]C[W190: White has no choice, the originally big ko threat on the left side now becomes smaller, White has to eliminate the ko, it seems Gu Li's choice is right.];B[gm]C[Through B191, it forms an exchange, White takes some advantage, but the situation is still to Black's advantage.];W[ip];B[mo];W[nr]C[Following W194, Xie He continues to fight, this game is very brilliant!];B[mq];W[mr];B[lp];W[or];B[kq];W[lr]
;B[oq];W[kp]LB[jq:a]C[W202: The original move is to bump over at 'a', the difference between them is small, but Black is too thick, White is very difficult to find chances again.];B[hp];W[lo];B[mp];W[hq];B[jp];W[ko];B[iq];W[io];B[gq];W[hr]
;B[ho];W[ir];B[fp];W[ep];B[gr];W[fo];B[gp];W[bm];B[co];W[ah];B[ai];W[bi];B[ag]
;W[aq];B[do];W[eo];B[ar];W[ah];B[em];W[en];B[ag];W[cs];B[bs];W[ah];B[da];W[bb]
;B[ag];W[ao];B[ap];W[ah];B[dm];W[cn];B[ag];W[hn];B[gn];W[jq];B[in];W[ah];B[cd]
;W[bd];B[ag];W[gs];B[fs];W[ah];B[mk];W[aj]C[In the game, White's play is very far-fetched, but it also shows Xie He's tenaciousness.];B[nj];W[jn];B[ln];W[im];B[go];W[qr]
;B[pr];W[ps];B[rr];W[rs];B[kn];W[jo];B[jk];W[rq];B[qq];W[ll];B[mm];W[sr];B[rp]C[Now Black is leading 10+ points on the board, now the game shouldn't have any suspense.]
;W[hs];B[fr];W[il];B[ik]C[When the situation is dangerous, Gu Li plays very calmly and looks more mature, which is the important reason for his victory.

Gu Li advances to the final, which will take place in April next year.])
