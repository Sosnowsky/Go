;B[eo];W[bk];B[fr]C[So far, the situation is exactly same as that in the game 3, the only difference in this game is that they switch colors in this match.];W[bs]LB[nq:a][gm:b]C[W34: White starts to vary, in the last game, Chang Hao played at 'a', in the Samsung final with Cho Hunhyun, Chang Hao played at 'b'. Because of different styles, both sides have different understanding in this local variation.];B[fl]C[B35 is a good point, Black is very thick in this area.];W[pq];B[qq];W[mq]C[W36 and W38 is Ma Xiaochun's top-notch maneuver for managing and dodging his stones.];B[kq]C[B39: Black forces from his thick side, it seems redundant, however there is no other good tactic to choose.]

;B[fc]C[B57: Black takes tenuki to approach the corner, it is a positive play.];W[ec]C[W58: White has no other choice in the place where your opponent is stronger.];B[fd];W[ce];B[ql]C[After B61, the situation is easier for Black to control.];W[kd];B[mc];W[le];B[pf];W[lh]C[The sequence from W62 to W66 is an exchange of "ideological and practical work".];B[jq]
;W[ip];B[iq]C[The connection of B67 and B69 is very substantial, Black is left with the possibility of attacking White later on.];W[ff];B[id];W[if]C[W70 and W72: White aims to destroy Black's outside thickness.];B[fb];W[db];B[jc];W[kc];B[kb];W[qj]C[The invasion of W78 is already imperative.];B[pr]
