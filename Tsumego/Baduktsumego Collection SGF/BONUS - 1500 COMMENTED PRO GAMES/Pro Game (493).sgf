Translation:GoGameWorld.];B[pd]C[After losing the first two games, Heyang won the next two games, all people thought this time he can keep his Mingren title, because the psychological factor is very favorable to Heyang. However things in the world are hard to imagine, Heyang's moves are too slow in this decisive game, completely not reflecting the momentum of conducting a big turnaround of losing the first two and winning the last three games! On the other hand, Qiu Jun overcame his psychological obstacle and gave a full play to his talent, in the end achieved a complete victory.];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[fq]
;W[cn];B[dr];W[po];B[qo];W[qn];B[qp];W[pn];B[op];W[pj];B[qh]C[The opening through B15 is rarely seen in recent years.];W[cq];B[iq];W[jd]LB[nc:a]C[W18: Normally White will directly approach at 'a', in the game White aims to reserve the invasion on the right side.]
;B[cf];W[be];B[di];W[nc];B[fc]C[Because White plans to have a fight at the top, it is better for White to approach the corner with W22 first, and Black takes tenuki to counter-approach. Here it is a playing psychology and the moves from both sides are not absolutely good or bad.];W[ec];B[fd];W[qc];B[qd]C[As to W26, B27 is the original move, because both sides have White's stones, the fight is definitely not to Black's advantage.];W[pc];B[od];W[oc]
;B[pl]C[B31 is the follow-up maneuver of this shape.];W[pp]LB[qq:a]C[The order of W32 is important! Because if Black doesn't want White's descent on the second line become sente, now Black can only connect inside at 'a'.];B[qq];W[ql];B[qk];W[pk];B[rl];W[qm];B[qj];W[pi];B[qi]
;W[ol]C[This way White gets to settle the shape up to W42, the exchange of W32 and B33 is favorable to White. In most cases, the squeezing move is a good asking move, please remember!];B[bf];W[eb];B[ef];W[mp]LB[ck:a]C[Of course W46 is a very big move, but the extension at 'a' is also not small, if it were me, I would elect to extend at 'a'.];B[cl];W[jq]LB[cr:a][oq:b][hq:c]C[W48: White continues to tangle, this is Qiu's style, I can't see why it is no good to block at 'a', however the purpose of W48 is also very clear, making a miai of two cuts 'b' and 'c'.];B[ip]
;W[ir];B[hr];W[kr];B[eo];W[oq];B[or];W[nq];B[em]LB[cr:a]C[B57: Is it explicable for Black to jump? Black is not painful by White's cut of W54? Why not crawl at 'a' to attack in order to redeem his loss? In the game, Black turns to enclose the center, but the center is open from four sides, perhaps this already means Black's defeat.];W[cr];B[nr];W[mr];B[lq]
;W[mq];B[jl];W[jj]C[The selection of W64 is proper, here Black already has no good way to enclose territory in the center, so there is no need to invade more deeply.];B[jp];W[ln]C[It is all clear when you see W66, Qiu Jun doesn't worry at all that Black encloses the center territory.];B[bm];W[do]C[W68 contains hidden tactic, White is not going to taking advantage with B67 unconditionally.];B[ij];W[ii];B[hj];W[jn];B[in]
;W[jk];B[il];W[hi];B[ji];W[ig];B[fb];W[bc];B[ea];W[cb];B[gi];W[gh]LB[kl:a]C[Black is very painful with the hane of W84. If Black retreats, White will play the hane at 'a', then it is still not sure whose territory is bigger!];B[kl]
;W[ee]C[But after the extension of B85, the diagonal's cut of W86 is severe! Black is busy to make life, how can he looks after his big territory?];B[fe];W[ff];B[gf];W[fg];B[cd]LB[df:a]C[B91 is a tesuji (the connection at 'a' is gote) but too damaging to territory.];W[df]C[W92: White takes chance to first obtain 10 plus points, then each side captures two stones, although Black eventually gets out of the dangerous situation, but he has paid a dear price.];B[eg];W[dg];B[eh];W[ce]
;B[fh];W[ki];B[jh];W[ih];B[gg];W[kg];B[rc];W[rb];B[ch];W[ep]C[However what the fatal thing is, Black wants to enclose the center territory tenaciously, but he can't stop the push of W106!];B[fo];W[fp];B[gp]
;W[dm];B[dl];W[gq];B[hp];W[fr]C[W114: White captures Black's two stones, Heyang must be very painful, in the game Black's is falling far behind in territory.];B[rd];W[ic];B[nd];W[md];B[me];W[le];B[ph];W[ro]
