Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[pd];W[dd]C[In NEC Cup fast game tournament this year, the first opponent I met with is Wang Xi 5p who improved very quickly in the last two years, in this game we are involved in ko fights all the time, in fast game this is very exciting.];B[pq];W[dp];B[qo]
;W[gq];B[mc];W[dj];B[fc];W[ee]C[The play of W6 and W10 often appears in Takemiya Masaki's games.];B[hd];W[fd];B[ec];W[dc];B[gd];W[gb]LB[gc:a]TR[fd]C[W16 is an asking move, if Black connects at 'a', the marked white stone becomes lighter.]
;B[hb];W[qi];B[cp];W[cq];B[co];W[bq];B[do]LB[en:a]C[The turn of B23 appears heavy, Black still should make the knight's move at 'a', which is light and nimble.];W[ep];B[cl];W[bk];B[bl];W[ck]
;B[el];W[fk];B[gm];W[ql]C[White gets to make an extension at 32, in the opening White already opens up the situation.];B[eg];W[cg];B[iq];W[oq];B[op];W[nq];B[pr];W[mo];B[oo]LB[qe:a]C[Black really doesn't want to play B41 but Black also really don't know which point is better to play. Perhaps for Black to take tenuki and protect the corner at 'a' is better.]
;W[kq];B[io];W[hn]LB[ko:a]C[W55 is unnecessary, jumping to 'a' is already very good enough.];B[gp]LB[ko:a]C[The attachment of B45 is not a good point to counterattack, jumping to 'a' is the urgent point.];W[hp]C[With the sequence following W46, Black's two groups all become a little thin.];B[hq];W[go];B[fp];W[fo]
;B[fq];W[fr];B[gr];W[eq];B[gq];W[eo];B[gk];W[fl];B[fm];W[ek];B[en]LB[em:a]C[The original move of B61 is to connect at 'a'.];W[dl]
;B[dm];W[em]LB[er:a][dk:b]C[W64 is an impulsive move, White's best move is to connect at 'a', next Black takes at 'b', White still can take tenuki, these two black groups are very passive.
];B[er]LB[fn:a]C[Black is tenacious with the atari of B65, since this is a 30-second-per-move fast game, Black tests whether White dares start a ko by playing at 'a'.];W[dr];B[fs];W[gl]C[In the real game, due to favorable consciousness, finally White doesn't elect to start the ko immediately, White takes the chance to stick his head out with W68 and also has nothing to complain.];B[hm];W[in];B[el]
;W[hl];B[im];W[jn];B[dk];W[ro];B[dl];W[qp];B[pp];W[qn]C[Although Black eliminates the ko with B77, but White takes profit with W78 and W80 and also should be satisfied.];B[lp];W[lq];B[pn];W[pm]LB[qm:a]C[W84 is just what White hopes for, here White has no state of mind to connect at 'a', although this way another new round of ko fights will start.]

;W[gc];B[hc];W[po];B[nr]C[The ko threat of B101 is to my surprise, however now Black also doesn't have any other proper ko threat.];W[on]C[White certainly will eliminate the ko with W102, White takes advantage.];B[or];W[jo];B[lr];W[qc];B[pc];W[qd];B[qe]
;W[re];B[rf];W[pb];B[ob];W[rb]
(;B[lo]LB[rd:a][pe:b][qf:c][rc:d][se:e][pa:f][jp:g]C[B115: if Black ataris at 'a', next W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 'e' and W 'f', White makes life, Black's outside is thin and perhaps Black has to reinforce, this way White can come back and play at 'g', White is favorable.];W[oc];B[od]C[The exchange of W116 and B117 is unnecessary.];W[jp];B[lm];W[qf]
;B[pe];W[rg]C[W120 and W122 are very big moves.];B[pf];W[qg];B[ej];W[kr];B[ip];W[di]LB[ei:a][fj:b][fi:c][gj:d][gi:e]C[The extension of W128 is a bad move! White should atari at 'a', next B 'b', W 'c', B 'd' and W 'e', sacrificing five stones is just the smart choice.]
;B[ho];W[gn];B[ms]LB[ei:a]C[B131: Black misses a good chance. Black should press at 'a', this way the situation most likely will be turned around.];W[fi]C[After the jump of W132, the difference in territory between both sides is not small.];B[db];W[cb];B[dh];W[eh];B[ds]C[Black hanes with B137, leading again to a ko, this is the last battle field, but now the ko is also very heavy for Black itself.];W[cs];B[bs]
;W[es];B[cj];W[fr];B[ci];W[ei];B[er];W[kn];B[ln];W[fr];B[rd];W[gs]LB[er:a][ds:b]C[W150 eliminating the ko is too hasty, White should answer the ko threat, next B 'a' and W 'b', in the real game after the exchange Black has retrieved a lot, but because Black incurs too much damage early, Black can't turn the game around.]
