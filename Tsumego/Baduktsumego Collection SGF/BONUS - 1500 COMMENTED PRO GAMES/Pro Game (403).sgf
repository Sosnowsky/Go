;W[do]C[The small diagonal's extension of W6 is recently very common.];B[ce]LB[ci:a]C[B7: Black can also consider to play the splitting move at 'a'.];W[ci];B[ed];W[ec];B[fd];W[gc];B[cc];W[gd];B[fc];W[fb]
;B[dd];W[gf];B[hq]LB[gb:a][hb:b][cb:c]C[B19: Normally Black will cut at 'a' to exchange for W 'b', this way White can no longer hane at 'c', however cutting first is also damaging, therefore comparing with the real game play, both have their pros and cons.];W[cb];B[bc];W[nc];B[qf];W[qq]LB[qn:a]C[W24 entering the corner is a surprising move, although both B19 and B23 are in a low position, but these two stones are too far away from each other, and also to enter the corner at 3-3 at this early stage of the game is always not good, for White to approach the corner at 'a' is the proper move.]
;B[pq];W[qp];B[qo];W[ro];B[qn];W[rn];B[qm];W[pr];B[or];W[qr];B[nq];W[pb]LB[ne:a]C[The knight's move of W36 is too territory-oriented, jumping at 'a' is imperative!]
;B[me]C[In the game, the large knight's move of B37 is a good point.];W[ld];B[gb]C[The cut of B39 is alert.];W[hb];B[le];W[ke];B[md];W[mc];B[kd];W[lc];B[kf];W[je]
;B[jf];W[ie]C[Through W50, Black is very happy!];B[dj]LB[ck:a]C[The exchange of B51 with W 'a' is not bad.];W[ck];B[cj]LB[in:a]C[However perhaps extreme joy begets sorrow, starting from B53, Black has played one bad move after another. Black tangles too much, Black should answer at around 'a', Black would be simply and clearly favorable.];W[bj];B[bk];W[bl];B[dk]
;W[ak];B[cl];W[cm];B[bk];W[io];B[rm]LB[go:a][if:b][hf:c][he:d][oe:e]C[The purpose of the turn of B63 is to create ko threats, but actually after White jumps back at 'a', Black still can't start the ko, because White's corner is too small. For Black to press at 'b' to create ko threats is more proper, next W 'c', then Black can start the ko, because cutting at 'd' to capture three white stones is clearly bigger than killing the corner, White's tactic of the knight's move at 'e' also disappears.];W[go];B[jj]C[B65: Now Black starts to enclose the center, it is already two-step slow.]
;W[oe]C[When White plays the knight's move with W66, Black can only push and cut, then sacrifice two stones in order to ensure side territory.];B[od];W[nd];B[ne];W[of];B[ng];W[qg];B[og];W[qe];B[rf];W[pe];B[re];W[qd]
;B[rd];W[qc];B[pg];W[ck];B[dl]LB[sn:a]C[B83 is too slow! Black should play the hane at 'a' to find ko threats, then take back, White is always burdensome, in the game White already has taken advantage.];W[fp];B[bk]LB[bh:a][cq:b]C[Since Black already connects with B83, Black again takes with B85 to exchange with W 'a', it is very damaging! Black should simply attack at 'b'.];W[bh];B[bm]
;W[ck];B[cq];W[bn];B[bp];W[db]C[The connection of W92 is a huge move!];B[cg]C[After the jump of B93, Black is still not alive locally, the situation already has been turned around completely.];W[di];B[hn]C[Black now encloses the territory with B95, it is already late.];W[iq];B[in];W[jo];B[jn]

;W[mq]LB[jh:a]C[The attachment of W126 is unnecessary, directly playing at 'a' is simple and clear.];B[ho];W[hp];B[jq]LB[gq:a][gp:b][hj:c]C[B129: Black should bump at 'a', then W 'b' and Black jumps to 'c' in sente, the variation is complicated.];W[ip];B[kr];W[kq];B[js]
;W[oo];B[om];W[jh];B[kh];W[ji];B[ki];W[ij]C[After W136 and W138 and W140, Black already can't look after both, either the center will get compressed, or the several stones on the left side will get killed, Black's corner in the upper left is still not completely alive, no matter how Black to play, Black's territory is not enough, in the end several black stones get killed,  on the board White is already leading in territory.];B[dm];W[am];B[gn];W[lr];B[np];W[no]
