In the challengers' final, Yu Bin won the game over Zhou Heyang and became the final challenger.];W[dd];B[pq];W[dq];B[do]
;W[co];B[cn]LB[dp:a]C[Lately B7 is more often played with the hit at 'a', but Yu Bin probably thinks that is not good.];W[cp];B[fc];W[cg];B[cc];W[dc];B[cd];W[de];B[ce];W[db];B[cf]
;W[df];B[bg];W[ch];B[bh];W[ci];B[bi];W[ic];B[eg]LB[dg:a][fe:b]C[The position up to 25 appeared once in the game between Chang Hao and Yoo Changhyeok, in that game W26 was played with the connection move at 'a', then Black jumped out at 'b'.];W[gd];B[fd]LB[dg:a]C[B27 pushes through and cuts, it's an overplay, it should just cut at 'a'.]
;W[fe];B[ge];W[gc]LB[he:a][ff:b][ee:c][dg:d]C[W30 is a mistake, it should first atari at 'a', then lean with 30. As a result, at the time when B 'b' ataris, White can connect at 'd' instead of 'c'.];B[ff]C[B31 is happy!];W[ee];B[dg];W[gf];B[ei];W[nc]C[B35 and W36 are miai, both are good points, neither side can be dissatisfied.]
;B[he]C[B37 is inevitable.];W[fg];B[id];W[jc];B[hc];W[gb];B[hb];W[fb];B[hd];W[kd];B[fh];W[ef];B[gh]
;W[hf];B[if];W[je];B[ie];W[hg]C[Through 54, both sides form some weird shapes.];B[jf];W[hh];B[jh];W[hj];B[dn]LB[ne:a]C[As for B59, in the postgame analysis, Liu Xiaoguang 9p think the cap at 'a' is much bigger, then White must first move out on the right.];W[ne]

;B[lq];W[qr]C[After W124, White has a good shape.];B[go];W[ip]C[White does all he can to reduce Black's territory with the move at 126.];B[pp];W[po];B[fm];W[kp];B[jo];W[kq];B[mo];W[or]
;B[mr];W[ln];B[mp];W[jq];B[oo];W[qp]C[W140 is a crude play! it should be reserved.];B[no];W[hq];B[hp]C[B143 is ingenious.];W[io];B[gn];W[fr]

;B[mm];W[kl];B[lm];W[dr];B[cr]LB[er:a][fq:b][ej:c][ak:d][fp:e][bo:f][ep:g]C[However, B161 is the losing move! Black miscalculated. At the current situation, it can only push at 'a'. White will lean out at 'b', then the cut at 'c' is brilliant! If White ataris at 'd', Black can block at 'e', White's big dragon is dead because the atari at 'f' is sente. Moreover, after B 'c', if White endures to connect, then Black can connect at 'g', White's big dragon cannot make life either.];W[er];B[js]

;B[kr];W[ep]C[After W178 makes life with sente, Black has already suffered a crushing defeat. The ensuing plays fully show Chang Hao's steady and safe style, even with this conservative way, White still won a lot in the end. Chang Hao needs to win just one more game in order to defend his title successfully.];B[bp];W[bb];B[cb];W[ca];B[bc];W[qb];B[qf];W[ai];B[ac];W[ah];B[ba]
