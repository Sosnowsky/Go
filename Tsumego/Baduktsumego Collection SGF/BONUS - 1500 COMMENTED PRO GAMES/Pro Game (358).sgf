;B[pf];W[ok];B[pm];W[ld]C[The invasion of W22 appears a little hasty.];B[ie];W[lf];B[ih];W[lh];B[ij]C[B23, B25 and B27: Black sticks the head out consecutively to the center and takes chance to reduce White's moyo at the bottom, Black's tempo is good.];W[oh];B[fc]C[Following B29 Black takes territory, testing White's attack skills.];W[he]

;W[qq]LB[qp:a]C[W44 is relentless! Here if Black retreats at 'a', Black's shape seems duplicated.];B[or]C[So the counterattack of B45 is inevitable.];W[qe];B[qd];W[rd];B[rc];W[rm];B[qm];W[rl];B[rn];W[ro]
;B[sn];W[qj];B[rk];W[qo]C[White's sequence from W50 to W58 is eye-dazzling, but Black handles calmly, White couldn't take any advantage.];B[qn];W[hb]LB[il:a]C[W60 is a hasty move! It is the reason that causes White's situation deteriorate.

With W60 White should play at 'a', Black will not play at 60 either.];B[bd]C[B61 itself is very big, W60 is clearly small.];W[be];B[bc];W[il];B[fi]
;W[di];B[ki];W[re]LB[cr:a]C[W68: White still stresses on attacking Black in the center, for White to play at 'a' is bigger.];B[dr]C[B69: Black takes tenuki and grabs this vital point, White sinks into a difficult situation.];W[er];B[cr];W[fq];B[lq];W[qr];B[jq];W[iq]
;B[kp];W[ko];B[lo]LB[ir:a]C[B79: For Black to first play at 'a' is relatively better.];W[jo];B[ir];W[hq];B[mo];W[pp];B[op];W[qp];B[rj]LB[so:a]C[B87 is a product of favorable consciousness, in fact if Black kills the corner directly at 'a', White will be more painful.]
;W[oo];B[no];W[on];B[pn];W[sr];B[bf]C[B93 makes White not able to enclose side territory, it is one of Black's proud moves. Because Black sees this move, Black elects to retreat with B87.];W[ln];B[np];W[rb];B[sc];W[nb];B[mc]LB[ob:a]C[B99 is a hasty move, Black should block at 'a'.]
;W[lc]LB[nc:a]C[W100 is weak, White should push at 'a', Black will be dangerous.];B[mb];W[lb];B[md];W[ma];B[ob];W[cf];B[ae];W[ce];B[bg];W[gj];B[gi]
;W[cg]LB[ch:a]C[W112 is a crude move, to make diagonal at 'a' is better.];B[bi];W[jr];B[kq];W[hj];B[hi];W[ik];B[fj]C[When Black turns with B119, White has no answer.];W[jj];B[dj]C[B121: White comes under attack instead. While feeling favorable, Black plays several slow moves.];W[ci]
;B[cj];W[ek];B[ej];W[fg];B[fk];W[ii];B[hh]LB[jb:a]C[B129: Black should play at 'a', this way White's situation is not good.];W[jc];B[hr];W[gr];B[gl]LB[fl:a]C[B133: Black should play at 'a'.]
;W[fl];B[fm];W[el];B[gk];W[gm];B[hm];W[gn];B[hl];W[qb]C[W142 is a game-deciding move, now the situation is chaotic.];B[qc];W[oa];B[pa];W[pb]

;W[qj];B[le]C[However when Black connects safely with B161, it seems Black is again favorable for the game.];W[nj]C[W162 is strong, here White can't give up an inch.];B[qi];W[co];B[bo];W[qj];B[so];W[sp];B[qi];W[oi];B[nk]
;W[mk];B[nl];W[ml]LB[mj:a]C[But W174 is too strong! White should play at 'a', this way the outcome of the game is still early.];B[mj];W[ni];B[lj]C[B175 and B177 are severe! White's situation has deteriorated.];W[kh];B[ji];W[ke];B[kf];W[pl]
;B[om]LB[pk:a]C[But B183 is a big mistake! Black should play at 'a', White is in a losing position.];W[pk];B[ql];W[qj];B[kd]C[However, even if White captures three stones with W184, through B187, Black is still a little favorable.];W[mm];B[nn];W[gc];B[kc];W[kb];B[jb]
;W[ja];B[hn];W[eb]C[W196: White ignores the center and grabs the endgame tenaciously.];B[ec];W[fb];B[ic];W[ib];B[go];W[fn];B[ip];W[hp];B[io];W[jh]C[W206: White initiates the ko strongly, the game enters into a decisive moment!]
;B[ij];W[ad];B[ac]LB[ho:a]C[In this crucial moment, B209 is miscalculation, if Black elects to exchange at 'a', Black will win the game. Afterwards, Black's four stones are being captured, the situation has been turned around.];W[ii];B[ia];W[ha];B[ij];W[bj];B[bh];W[ii];B[ho];W[bk]

;B[lm];W[sb];B[kk];W[kj];B[si]C[Next B247 is a clever endgame.];W[sh];B[pg]C[When Black connects back B19 with B249, White already has no chance to win.];W[qg];B[is];W[da];B[ca];W[ah]
