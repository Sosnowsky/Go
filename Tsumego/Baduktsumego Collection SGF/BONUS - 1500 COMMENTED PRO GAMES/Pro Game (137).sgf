Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[In this game, Cho Chikun's fighting spirit is worth admiring. Normally when you become older, your play will become more conservative and slow, however as for Cho Chikun, that is not the case, he will charge ahead whenever possible.];W[pp];B[dd];W[od]C[W4 aims to disrupt opponent's plan in the opening, Cho U also likes to play this way.];B[oe]
;W[qc];B[pe];W[nd];B[ne];W[md];B[rc];W[pc];B[dp];W[pj];B[ql]LB[qh:a]C[The invasion of B15 is full of fighting spirit! The common play is at 'a', Black can be satisfied.];W[nj];B[ok]
;W[ph];B[qn];W[qo];B[pn];W[nq]C[W22: White underestimates Cho Chikun's bravery!];B[op];W[oq];B[qq]LB[np:a]C[B23 and B25 are also the strongest moves! Although the following variation is complicated, but Black can fight more adequately, therefore with W22 for White to play at 'a' is better.];W[po]C[After this move, it is time for lunch break.];B[pq];W[oo]
;B[np];W[mp];B[no];W[on];B[mo];W[lp];B[lo];W[kp];B[ko];W[nm];B[jp];W[jq];B[lr]C[B41 is the key move in this local fight!]

(;W[kq]LB[mr:a][or:b][nr:c][ms:d][pr:e][mq:f][jr:g][iq:h][ip:i]C[W42: White has no other choices, if White hangs at 'a', then B 'b', W 'c' and B 'd'! Next if W 'e', then B42, W 'f', B 'g', W 'h' and B 'i', White is not good (see var a). With B41 if Black directly plays double-hane at 'h', the variation after White's descent at 'g' described above is no longer working, so White has to play W42.];B[iq]C[The sequence following B43 is one-way street.];W[ip];B[jo]
;W[ir];B[hq];W[hr]LB[mr:a]C[In the process, with W48, if White kills the corner at 'a', Black can turn at 48, Black's outside influence is complete and Black will be very happy! White is also not good.];B[mq];W[mr];B[nr];W[lq];B[or];W[mq];B[ms];W[gq];B[hp]
;W[ks]C[Through W58, Black lives the corner in sente, Black is good.];B[ol];W[ml];B[mk];W[kl]LB[nk:a]C[As to the crossover of B61, with W62 if White fights directly by playing at 'a', since Black at the bottom is alive, White is not good.];B[oj];W[ro];B[rr];W[go];B[im];W[il]
;B[hl]LB[ho:a]C[B69 is overly strong! With B69 Black should play at 'a', this is just the shape.];W[jm]C[W70 makes Black painful.];B[gp];W[in];B[io];W[hm]C[W74: White makes ponnuki, Black incurs loss.];B[oi];W[ng];B[fq];W[oh];B[ni]
;W[gr];B[me];W[lg];B[ld];W[le];B[lf]LB[nh:a][ke:b][og:c]C[B85 again is a careless move! Black should squeeze at 'a', White can only extend at 'b', then B 'c', capturing two stones, this result is better than the real game.];W[ke];B[mg];W[mh];B[mf]
;W[nh];B[kf];W[kd]C[When W92, the situation is already kind of turned around.];B[id];W[rk]LB[ki:a]C[But W94 is a careless move! White should simply play at 'a', Black is still not completely alive.];B[pi];W[qh];B[ri]C[B95 and B97 are good moves!];W[qi];B[rj];W[qj]
;B[qk];W[rh];B[rl];W[ki];B[je];W[kc];B[jh];W[lk];B[lm];W[ll];B[cf];W[dc]LB[cn:a][fo:b][ck:c]C[White incurs a big loss in territory with the sequence following W112. White should approach at 'a', next B 'b' and W 'c', this way it will be a close game.]

;W[ge];B[fe];W[ff];B[gd];W[hd];B[ee];W[he];B[hc];W[ic];B[gb];W[ie]LB[hb:a][ib:b]C[W136: If White plays atari at 'a', Black will initiate the ko at 'b', as a result, White lacks one ko threat.]
;B[ib];W[jd];B[re];W[rb];B[sb];W[qb];B[lh];W[kh];B[kg];W[mi];B[hg];W[cn];B[co]LB[fo:a]C[B149 is a crude move! Black should simply hang at 'a', this way White is very difficult to enclose territory on the left side, Black can keep advantage.]
;W[dn];B[fo];W[eo];B[fp];W[cq]C[W152 and W154 are good moves!];B[om];W[nn];B[dq];W[bo];B[bp];W[cp];B[bq];W[do]
;B[cr];W[ch]C[Through W164, White takes advantage, the situation is unclear.];B[fm];W[dk];B[ji];W[hk];B[ci]C[B169 is really a surprising move! Black's upper-right big dragon is still not alive, Black dares invade the left side! It is very hard to believe half-100-years-old Cho Chikun is still such brave and full of fighting spirit! Of course, this is absolutely not to mess things up, although Black appears very dangerous, but if White wants to conquer Black, it still needs a very high talent!];W[dh]C[White is perhaps irritated by seemingly-unreasonable B169, afterwards White's play is somewhat chaotic.];B[bh];W[bg];B[bi];W[cg]
;B[ej];W[fh];B[dj];W[fl]LB[gj:a][el:b]C[W178 is the losing move! White should play at 'a', forcing Black to make life the upper right big dragon, then White can go all out and kill Black on the left side by playing at 'b', this variation is very complicated, the outcome of the game is still unclear.];B[gj]LB[kj:a]C[B179: Black connects together with his big dragon by using the sente move at 'a', it is obvious that White's attack completely fails.];W[ig];B[ih];W[hi];B[hj]
;W[hh];B[kj];W[lj];B[ij];W[ck];B[li]C[After Black lives completely with B189, Black wins the game for sure.];W[co];B[fr];W[fi];B[el];W[em];B[gl];W[fk]
