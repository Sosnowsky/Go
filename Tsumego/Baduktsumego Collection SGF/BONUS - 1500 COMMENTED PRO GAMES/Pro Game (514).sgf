;B[oq];W[qj];B[cf];W[fc];B[bd];W[cc];B[ci];W[qm];B[nc]C[Kong Jie is well prepared for the opening, the situation is leading to a prolonged war, and it is to his favor.];W[fq];B[hc];W[qg];B[bp]
;W[mq]C[When B17, White perhaps is hard to choose where to play, therefore he simply takes tenuki.];B[cn];W[jp];B[en]C[However, through the jump of B21, Black can be satisfied.];W[pq]LB[nq:a]C[Although White can live the corner by the attachment of W22, but Black can hit at 'a', White is not necessarily favorable.];B[pp];W[qq];B[nq];W[rp];B[mp];W[lq]
;B[ro];W[rq];B[qn];W[rm];B[lp];W[kp];B[lr]LB[lo:a][pm:b][pl:c][ol:d]C[B33 and B35 are bad moves, although Black can capture the corner, but White can hane at 'a' in sente, Black is very painful! With B33, Black should hane at 'b', next W 'c' and B 'd', making himself thick and later considering the tactic in the corner.];W[mr];B[pr]
;W[lo]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.];B[np];W[lc]LB[jc:a]C[The selection of W40 is very difficult, perhaps to invade at 'a' is a little better.];B[pf];W[id];B[fd]C[The attachment of B43 is a good move, White is a little painful.]
(;W[df]LB[ec:a][cg:b][bg:c][gd:d][gc:e][ge:f][fb:g][eb:h][ed:i][fe:j][ff:k][ee:l]C[The attachment of W44 is a mistake! Locally after Black hanes at 'a', when W 'b', Black's counter-hane at 'c' is again a good move! White doesn't have any follow-up maneuver. With W44 White can only hane at 'd', next B 'e', W 'f', B 'a', W 'g', B 'h', W 'i', B 'j', W 'k', B 'l' and W44, giving Black two stones, this way although White incurs loss in territory, but White becomes thick and also gains some profit (see var a).];B[ec]

(;W[fb]LB[ed:a][fe:b][gc:c][bf:d][ce:e][bh:f][de:g][ee:h][dg:i][ch:j][ef:k][dh:l]TR[cg]C[The descent of W48 is not acceptable, at any rate White should cut at 'a'! if Black ataris at 48, then W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 'e', W 'f', B 'g', W 'h', B 'i', W 'j', B 'k' and W 'l', this way although White is no good either, but at least it is much better than letting Black take the marked white stone (see var a).]
;B[ed];W[eb];B[hd];W[bf];B[ce];W[de];B[ch];W[ic];B[dg];W[hb];B[ef]C[Through the hane of B59, White incurs a big loss, the situation is clearly to Black's advantage.];W[rd];B[go]
;W[qc];B[gq];W[gr];B[hq];W[hr];B[pg];W[pc];B[ie]TR[pf][pg]C[The sequence following B69 is not bad, only if Black lives the marked stones, White's territory would be clearly inadequate.];W[je];B[jf];W[ke]

Now only if Black makes life by attaching at 'a', Black would be leading about 10 points on the board.];W[of]C[White happily delivers the killing move of W142, Black already has no way to make life.
