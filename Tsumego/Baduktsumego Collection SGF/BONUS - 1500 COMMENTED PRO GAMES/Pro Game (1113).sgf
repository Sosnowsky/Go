;B[op];W[no];B[oo];W[nn];B[mr];W[qf];B[pi];W[of];B[nc];W[rd];B[qc];W[ri]C[Through W18, it is a novel opening.];B[co]LB[do:a]C[B19: Black can also consider to approach at 'a'.]
;W[cm]LB[dl:a]C[W20: White can also pincer-attack at 'a'.];B[eo]TR[mr]C[After Black jumps out with B21, since Black already has B11 (the marked stone), ...];W[fp];B[dj];W[ek];B[fo]TR[cm]C[..., following B25 Black presses continuously, the position of W20 (the marked stone) appears too close to Black's thickness.];W[gp];B[go];W[hp]
;B[ho];W[ip];B[dk]LB[cf:a]C[Even like this, the push and cut of B31 is overly strong, Black should approach the corner at 'a'.];W[dl];B[el];W[em]C[Being ataried by W34, ...];B[fl]C[..., Black's shape is very ugly.];W[bo];B[cp];W[fm];B[bl]
;W[bm];B[gm];W[gl];B[fk];W[ej];B[ei]LB[di:a]C[In the process, Black should retreat at 'a' with B45, White can't make life locally, both sides have no assurance of success in the fight. However, in the real game Black is not good, Black should fight this way.];W[hm]C[White plays atari again with W46, Black's shape becomes even worse.];B[gn];W[fj];B[gk];W[gj]
;B[hk];W[ck];B[hj];W[gi];B[cj];W[bk];B[bj];W[al];B[bp];W[bn]C[Through W60, Black is not good.];B[jn];W[hi]LB[hl:a][dg:b]C[The play of W62 may be of favorable consciousness or White may think White's connection at 'a' is working. White should attack slowly at 'b' and also echo his five stones in the center, Black is difficult to handle.]
;B[df]LB[cf:a]C[B63: Black certainly should approach low at 'a'.];W[cf];B[cg];W[ce];B[bg];W[fc];B[fg]C[B69 is also inexplicable, Black should reinforce at Tengen, this way the situation is not clear.];W[jm]LB[fh:a]C[W70 is overly hasty, White should make diagonal at 'a' to probe Black.];B[hl]
;W[in];B[io];W[jo];B[kn];W[km];B[ii];W[gg];B[gf]LB[ln:a]C[With B79, Black ends in gote unexpectedly. Black should extend out at 'a', White is a little difficult.];W[ih];B[ji];W[ko];B[jf]
;W[jg]LB[hf:a][if:b]C[W84 is good move! If White plays hane at 'a' carelessly, Black can bump at 'b', White is dangerous.];B[kg];W[if];B[kf];W[ie];B[gd];W[fh];B[eg];W[ic];B[gc];W[kd]
;B[me]C[B95: Black should first act in the upper left corner.];W[eb]C[W96 is good move!];B[hb];W[kh]C[Then White starts to attack Black with W98.];B[jh];W[ig]C[White is already alive.];B[kk];W[lh];B[ed]LB[mg:a][mc:b][lc:c]C[B03: Black loses common sense, Black certainly should jump out at 'a'. This way if White bumps at 'b', Black can counterattack at 'c'.]
;W[mc];B[md];W[lc];B[nb];W[mf]C[W108 is vital point.];B[mg];W[lg];B[lf];W[nf];B[le];W[rc];B[pe];W[pf]
;B[rb];W[sb];B[jb];W[eh];B[dh];W[mb];B[pb]C[Black can only live painfully.];W[ra];B[qb];W[hf]C[Then White reinforces to make life, Black is losing.];B[dc];W[cc]
