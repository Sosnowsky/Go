;B[pc]C[The opening up to B19 is the same as that in the game 2 of Samsung Cup between Gu Li and Lee Sedol, however in that game, Lee Sedol took Black.];W[oe]LB[ph:a][pi:b]C[Obviously Lee Sedol has studied this variation after he lost that game, White simply retreats with W20 instead. In that game, Gu Li first attached at 'a', Lee Sedol played hane at 'b'. In fact, when White attaches at 'a', Black should take tenuki and hane at 20 instead, White is no good. Therefore, Lee Sedol elects to retreat with W20.];B[pe];W[pf];B[of];W[og];B[nf];W[ph];B[ng]LB[me:a][oc:b]C[B27: How to strengthen and capture two white stones is a difficult problem. If Black strengthens loosely by playing at 'a', later on White's block at 'b' is kind of sente, White's two stones still have some room for action. In the game, the turn of B27 looks crude, but in order to capture cleanly, Black also has no other choice.]
;W[nh];B[oi];W[oh];B[nd];W[qi]C[Through the hane of W32, in this local variation, the situation is about even, White has nothing to complain.];B[po];W[hc]C[The invasion of W34 is a good point!];B[he]LB[hd:a][id:b]C[The knight's move of B35 is the original move, if Black attaches at 'a', White will wedge at 'b', Black has no follow-up.];W[jc];B[kc]
;W[kd]C[The attachment and cut of W36 and W38 is a common maneuver to dodge.];B[ke];W[ld];B[lc];W[le];B[jb];W[ic];B[je];W[lf];B[oc];W[gd];B[mh];W[ni]
;B[mi]LB[kg:a]C[The press of B51 is unreasonable, Black should jump to 'a' to capture White's several stones, this is the original move.];W[kg]C[After White gets out with the diagonal extension of W52, Black himself is also not thick.];B[jh];W[kh];B[dc];W[cc];B[ed];W[db]LB[ge:a][hd:b]C[The exchange of B55, B57 and W56, W58 is also very damaging to territory, but in order to press at 'a' in sente, Black also has no other alternative. Once the fight starts, there will be no time to exchange, but at the same time the value of the squeezing move at 'b' also becomes smaller, White can take tenuki temporally.];B[ge]

(;B[ll]LB[ok:a][nj:b][oj:c][pj:d][pk:e][mm:f][gc:g]C[The cut of B79 is the losing move for the game! Black apparently overlooks White's good knight's move at 'a'. Black doesn't have any good follow-up temporally. With B79, Black should turn at 'b', next W 'c', B 'a', W 'd', B 'e', W 'f' and B 'g', capturing four white stones, this way it will be still a very long game (see var a).];W[ok];B[mg]LB[lm:a][mk:b][gc:c]C[Black continues to tangle with B81, this is the final losing move. Black should extend at 'a' instead, next W 'b' and B 'c', this way although Black already incurs loss, but Black still have a chance of winning.]
