Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[In the game 3 of the 29th Japanese Meijin best-of-7 title match, the title holder Yoda Norimoto took Black and defeated the challenger Cho U by resignation, therefore leading the series by 2:1.];W[od]C[W2: White immediately approaches the corner, it is an attitude of seeking fights.];B[cp];W[pq];B[dc]
;W[qc];B[eq];W[cf]C[But next White again casually approaches the corner with the large knight's move of W8, it seems White's thinking is a little not coherent.];B[ch];W[cc];B[cd];W[dd];B[bc];W[cb];B[de];W[ed];B[ce];W[bb]LB[fc:a]C[As to the joseki in the upper left corner, if White plays at 'a' instead with W18, White can prevent Black from expanding his moyo.]
;B[fe];W[ee];B[ef];W[ec];B[df];W[qo]C[However, in the game, White takes sente and gets to protect the corner with W24, which also should be a very enticing good point.];B[kp];W[rd]LB[qe:a][qf:b]C[W26: White is very confused, he perhaps can pincer at 'a' or 'b'.];B[pc];W[pd]
;B[qe];W[rc];B[fm]C[In the game, Black is left with some aji to use later on and takes tenuki to expand with B31, it is very bold and powerful.];W[mq];B[pj];W[ph]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.];B[mc];W[nc]LB[oh:a][ni:b]C[W32 and B33 are miai, but next the diagonal of W36 is no good, Black takes advantage by pressing at 'a', Black takes the initiative, with W36 White should grab the vital point by playing the knight's move at 'b'.];B[oh];W[og]
;B[nh];W[pi]C[White already has no other choice but to push and cut with W40.];B[oj];W[oi];B[ni];W[nj];B[qj];W[pg];B[qn]C[After Black descends in sente with B45, Black attaches with B47 and handles lightly, it is common sense.];W[pn]LB[po:a]C[W48: White should calmly extend at 'a'.];B[pm]
;W[mj];B[ro];W[po];B[rm]C[Through B53, Black has nothing to complain.];W[cm]LB[rp:a][fk:b]C[Although for White to hane at 'a' is huge, but White can't afford to end in gote here again. However, the play of W54 is over-zealous, now the center is most important, White should play at 'b', this way White wouldn't necessarily sink into passivity.];B[ck];W[co];B[do];W[dn];B[bo]
;W[fn];B[cn];W[em];B[eo];W[en]C[In the game, although White has escaped, but Black's side and corner doesn't incur loss, and White's lonely group is very heavy, White already is in a passive state.];B[qp];W[pp]LB[qq:a]C[W66 is no good, White can only block at 'a'.];B[nm];W[lh];B[nb]C[The hane of B69 makes White painful.];W[ob]
;B[nd];W[oc];B[jd];W[md];B[ld];W[me];B[le];W[mf]C[Through W78, Black takes advantage again.];B[lq];W[mr]LB[rp:a]C[When Black makes the diagonal hit of B79, with W80 White certainly should cut and capture Black's one stone at 'a'.];B[qq]C[After this move, the game was closed for the first day.]
;W[io]LB[hn:a]C[W82 is a game-deciding move under an unfavorable situation, with W82 White originally should jump to 'a' and slowly wait for chances.];B[ho]C[B83: In the game, Black is not soft-hearted and takes control of the game right away, in the end White has no state of mind to continue the fight and concedes defeat very earlier on.];W[in];B[gm];W[dk];B[bm];W[fk];B[hl];W[hk];B[ik];W[hj]
;B[il];W[hp];B[go];W[jq];B[dl];W[dj];B[el];W[cj];B[bk];W[fl];B[cl];W[dh];B[eh]
;W[fi]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.];B[hq];W[iq];B[gp];W[hc];B[ip];W[jp];B[kn];W[lp];B[kq];W[kr];B[ko];W[ir]
