Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[pd]C[As to Korean Team, this game is very important, we can't lose. Personally I like taking White.];W[dc]C[Both players are of territory-style, we expect this game will be steady and territory-racing big fight.];B[qp];W[dq];B[de]

;B[df];W[fc];B[ci];W[gk];B[ik]C[As to the cap of B23, both players seem to have studied. So far, Peng Quan 7p is in meditation for the first time.

As to 1-hour fast game, how to use time is very important.];W[fi]C[The knight of W24 is beautiful and also urgent point to dodge. Black seems to have no good way to attack.];B[dd];W[ed]C[In the exchange of B25 and W26, Park YuongHoon 9p is relatively alert and Peng Quan 7p is relatively confident.];B[ej]C[B27: Black seeks a way to attack.];W[ek];B[fj]
;W[gj];B[fk];W[fl];B[dj]C[B33: Black is a little thin.];W[gm]C[W34: White plays very fast.];B[ck]C[B35 is good move. So far, the situation is steady.];W[dm];B[ep]C[B37: I also think the same move.];W[eq];B[cc];W[bc]
;B[cb];W[bb];B[bf];W[db]C[W44: White's aji is very good. Generally White will hang on the left side and grab territory.];B[hl];W[gl]C[W46: Black considers whether to make knight over or attach over.];B[cm]C[B47: Black attaches over.];W[gp]C[W48: It seems White has no confidence to act on the left side and worries Black may get sente. Black is now pondering. Black should consider how to use two stones on the right side in the second half.];B[hn]C[The aji of B49 is very bad and not efficient.];W[go];B[pj]C[B51 taking star point is inexplicable. It seems Black turns the body around. Park YuongHoon may have just taught me one move. B49 is perhaps miscalculation. If Black wants to take tenuki, it is better to take tenuki directly.]

;B[ko];W[mp]C[W66: I thought the same move.

Black must form territory on the right side and keep balance in territory. Pros in study room think White's situation is better. However I feel Black is also playable. Now let's count points. White has 13 points at bottom, 30 points at top, total about 43 points. Black has 18 points on left and 30 points on the right. So the situation is still about even. It is surprised to find out White's territory at the bottom is not big as imagined.];B[nc];W[qh];B[qi];W[om]C[W70 is a rare tactic, what's the purpose?];B[ol];W[nl]C[W72: White suddenly puts emphasis on center. Peng Quan may think, even if White destroys the right side, Black's center will become thick, it is not interesting. So, now B49 looks worse. Park YuongHoon 9p feels his play is bad, he is a little hesitant.];B[pl]C[With the connection of B73, Black's aji is not bad.];W[mm];B[ii]C[B75: Pros in study room think Black's situation is not bad. Why doesn't Black play in the upper right corner?]
;W[qd]C[W76: White seems to have found a good tactic to dodge.];B[qe];W[re];B[qc];W[rd];B[pe]C[After W80, B81 is a must.];W[rc];B[qb];W[qf]C[W84: White wants to settle this group.
¡¡¡¡ ];B[rh];W[rg];B[ph]
;W[qg];B[ic];W[ie]C[W90: It seems both sides want to avoid fight.];B[ri]C[B91 is a thick move.];W[rb];B[ra]C[B93: Black forces White to live locally.];W[og]C[W94: White jumps out to center.];B[kd]C[B95: Black first protects the top side.];W[ne]C[W96 is thick, reinforcing the right side and also aiming at the top.];B[jf]C[W97: Black wants White to reinforce.]
;W[pf]C[W98 is another rare tactic. Both sides enter into overtime, the fight continues. Both sides are thick.];B[dn];W[gn]C[W100 is thick play.];B[md];W[jl]C[W102: White aims at Black's thinness in the center.];B[il];W[hb]C[W104: Lee Changho thinks Black's situation is very bad. It is really hard to understand. originally Black's situation is not good, why allowing White to play this freely?];B[hc];W[ib];B[jb];W[gc]
;B[ia];W[dl]C[W110 is good move, Black's komi becomes burden.];B[cl];W[bp]C[W112 is very big.

Now White has 38 points at bottom, 13 points at top and 4 points in the upper right corner. Black's three groups all have 18 points. So, their territory is about equal.];B[on]C[The center still has some variations, Park 9p may still have chance.];W[nn];B[cp];W[cq];B[gb];W[fb];B[ha];W[jn]
;B[in];W[bo];B[bn];W[oc]C[W124 is a forcing move to extend thinking time. ];B[ob];W[me];B[pc];W[nd]C[The play of W128 is over-tenacious.];B[mg]C[B129 is the last game-deciding move. If White wants to fight, Black is glad to fight to the end.];W[lg];B[ld]C[Not sure what the purpose of B131 is. Since Black already plays in the center, why elect to connect?]
;W[mh];B[lh];W[ng]C[W134: Peng Quan 7p answers correctly. Park YuongHoon's hope of turning the game around is remote.];B[km];W[kl];B[nm];W[mn];B[jm];W[lm];B[kg];W[mf];B[rr];W[rs]
;B[bq];W[br];B[li]C[B147: Now Black catches up a lot.];W[kj];B[nk];W[ml];B[bd];W[ca];B[be];W[od];B[nb];W[kf];B[jh]
;W[ig];B[jg];W[jj];B[ij]C[B161: Now the situation becomes very close. Only if handling the center well, Park YuongHoon will be able to find a chance to overturn the game.];W[if];B[gi];W[gh];B[hi];W[fg];B[ff];W[gf];B[fe];W[gd]
;B[ge];W[hd];B[kn];W[lp]C[Black takes advantage in the exchange of B173 and W174. The situation becomes closer and closer.];B[eg];W[hm];B[im];W[dp];B[em];W[el];B[eo]C[Through B181, Black is leading 8 points, but White has sente. It shows Park YuongHoon's endgame skill is really unusual, his tenacious fight finally gets reward.];W[oi]

;W[do];B[cn];W[ee];B[ef];W[ni];B[jq]C[Through B201, after careful calculation, Black basically wins the game.];W[jr];B[cc];W[lj];B[mi];W[mk];B[nj];W[om]
;B[pq];W[pr];B[oq];W[or];B[qn];W[oo];B[nm];W[mo];B[jd]C[Through B217, even if losing the ko fight, Black still has 7-point advantage. Black wins the game for sure.];W[om];B[jk];W[kk];B[nm]
