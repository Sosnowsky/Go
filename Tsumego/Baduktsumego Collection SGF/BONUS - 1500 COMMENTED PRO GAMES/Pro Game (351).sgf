(;SZ[19]DT[1992-12-15]EV[5th China-Japan Meijin Dual Match]RE[W+1.5]PC[Tokyo, Japan]PB[Kobayashi Koichi]PW[Ma Xiaochun]KM[5.5]BR[9p]WR[9p]C[A Game of washing off humiliation. As to Ma Xiaochun, the winter of 1992 is really too warm. In this year's 5th China-Japan Meijin dual match, he defeated super first-class player Kobayashi Koichi 9p whom he lost to in eight consecutive games. With ten year's tenacious effort, Ma Xiaochun finally achieved this long waited victory. The iron wall of super first-class Japanese players disappears ever since. Three years after, Ma Xiaochun obtained both Tong Yang Cup champion and Fujitsu Cup champion, two biggest international Go championship events at that time. In Fujitsu Cup, after he defeated Kobayashi Koichi and won the champion, Ma Xiaochun can't help but said, today I should first thank Kobayashi Koichi. This statement was also a summary of his sixth consecutive loss in China-Japan Meijin dual match (he lost to Kobayashi Koichi by 0:2 in term 2, 3 and 4, and eventually defeated Kobayashi Koichi by 2:0 in term 5.).];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[qo]C[B1, B3 and B5 are "Kobayashi Style".]
;W[jp]C[W6 is can't-be-missed big point.];B[cn];W[fq]LB[jq:a]C[As to the approach of B7, the small knight of W8 is Ma's style. In the past, even if W6 at 'a', the small knight of W8 is also possible.];B[bp]C[Following B9, both sides elect to play small knight.];W[qf];B[nc];W[rd];B[fc];W[cf];B[db]C[Through B15, there are total 7 small-knight moves on the board.]
;W[cl];B[cq];W[md];B[mc];W[kd];B[en];W[gd]C[After forcing with W16, White makes shoulder-hit with W18 then W22, this shows Ma Xiaochun's special talent.];B[fd];W[fe];B[cc];W[gc];B[fb];W[qc]

;W[eg];B[ed];W[dh];B[ch];W[di];B[bf]C[Through B55, Black obtains profit, but White also becomes thick in the center. Since Black is still not alive completely in the upper right corner, Black is very difficult to play freely in the center.];W[gn]LB[fi:a]C[W56 is overplay, now White should reinforce at around 'a', White can be satisfied.];B[fi];W[gi];B[gh];W[fh]
;B[hi];W[gj];B[gg]C[B57 is the vital point, Black makes shape by wrapping up White, White instantly appears insipid.];W[fj];B[jh];W[ii]C[Starting from W66, White attacks fiercely, if Black makes life comfortably, White will lose the game for sure.];B[jc];W[jb];B[hc];W[ib];B[hb];W[ha]
