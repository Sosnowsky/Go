Now let's take a look at one game in 1st Prices Information Cup between Cho Hunhyun and Park YuongHoon.];W[dd];B[pq];W[oc]C[W4: White approaches the corner first, this is Cho Hunhyun's favorite.];B[kd]
;W[po];B[pl];W[no];B[nq];W[qq];B[qr];W[qg];B[pe];W[qj]C[As to the two-space pincer of B7, White's play of W12 and W14 is novel and creative.];B[ok];W[og];B[nd]C[As to the result up to B17, it seems White can fight adequately.]
;W[qp];B[or];W[lo]LB[oi:a]C[Before jumping with B20, White can consider to make the knight's move at 'a' first, this is simpler and clearer.];B[oi]C[B21 is an eye-catching excellent point.];W[mg];B[lj];W[nc]C[White takes some profit again following W24, Cho Hunhyun's fighting spirit is very vigorous.];B[md];W[qb];B[mb];W[rc]
;B[qc];W[rb];B[nf];W[nj];B[oj];W[oh]C[W32 and W34 are good moves to dodge.];B[rf]LB[ni:a][re:b][mh:c]C[B35: If Black turns at 'a', White will jump over at 'b'. Black couldn't exchange B 'a' and W 'c'.];W[ni];B[nk]
;W[kh];B[kl]LB[rg:a][qh:b][mn:c][mo:d]C[Before reinforcing with B39, Black can consider to first crawl at 'a', next W 'b', B 'c' and W 'd', after this exchange, White is difficult to make life locally.
];W[mc];B[lc];W[nb]LB[oa:a]C[If White doesn't strengthen with W40 and W42, White can also make life, however later on Black will exploit by playing at 'a', so it makes a big difference in points and also it is related to both sides' thickness and thinness. Overall, W40 and W42 are worth one move.
];B[fc];W[le]
;B[mf]LB[ld:a]C[Black's counterattack with B45 is rash, it is the losing move of this game. Black can only simply connect at 'a', this way the game will still last long.];W[ld]C[White alertly grabs the chance by cutting with W46.];B[lg];W[kc];B[lh];W[qf];B[qe];W[rg];B[rk];W[re]C[Since White can simply make life on the right side, through W54, Black incurs a big loss. White establishes superiority at one stroke.];B[jo]
;W[lm];B[ll];W[rn];B[jc];W[lb];B[kb];W[lc];B[cf];W[fd];B[gd];W[ec];B[fe];W[ed]
;B[ef];W[ce]C[W70 is an asking move.];B[bf]LB[dg:a][gc:b]C[B71: If Black makes the diagonal at 'a', White will play atari at 'b'.];W[ge];B[hd];W[df];B[dg];W[ff];B[eg];W[ee]
;B[fb];W[lf];B[ng];W[kg]C[W80 and W82 are still sente, White is very happy. White takes a big lead in the game.];B[mh];W[eb];B[ib];W[dj];B[fg];W[he];B[ie];W[if];B[je]
;W[cm];B[bd];W[be];B[ae];W[ch];B[ci]LB[cg:a][bc:b]C[B97 is sharp. If Black connects at 'a', White can make life by sacrificing at 'b'.];W[bi];B[gg];W[hf];B[cj];W[di]
;B[bh];W[bg];B[dh];W[ah];B[ck]C[B107 is a strong move, the situation is a little chaotic.];W[gc];B[gb];W[cg];B[de];W[hc]C[Luckily White has the ko threat at 110, in the exchange up to W112, White obtains considerable territory.];B[cd];W[id]
;B[dk]LB[co:a][cn:b][do:c][ag:d]C[B115 is careless, Black misses a good chance. Black should force at 'a', next W 'b', B 'c', W115 and B 'd', throwing to initiate a ko, this way Black would still have a chance to win.];W[cp]C[After White makes two-space extension with B116 and settles down, Black already has no chance on the board.];B[eq];W[dq];B[ep];W[dn];B[on];W[oo];B[mp]
