;W[co];B[pj]C[The opening from B1 to B7 is very popular again recently.];W[jp];B[mq]C[B9: Black can consider to play at top.];W[jc]C[Since W10 is an excellent point.];B[cf];W[be];B[di];W[dk]LB[mc:a]C[W14 is unnecessary, to make two-space extension at 'a' instead is clearly good point.];B[fd]C[B15 is a positive move.]
;W[ef]C[From W16 to W28, White already can't back down.];B[dc];W[cc];B[ec];W[cb];B[hc];W[gf];B[he];W[ge];B[gd];W[id];B[hd];W[fj]C[White attacks Black.]
;B[ce];W[cd];B[bf];W[bd];B[eg];W[ee];B[lc]C[B35: But Black takes tenuki and grabs big point, White is difficult.];W[ci]LB[cj:a]C[The attachment of W36 is the losing move. Even though it is painful, White still should attack slowly at 'a'.];B[cj]C[Black gets to play hane with B37.];W[ch];B[dj]
;W[dg]TR[ce][cf][bf]C[White captures three useless stones with W38 and W40, White clearly fails.];B[cm]LB[dh:a][cg:b]C[B41: Black should first squeeze at 'a', after making exchange with W 'b', then B41.];W[bl]C[The counterattack of W42 is inevitable.];B[bi];W[cl]LB[bh:a]C[But W44 is not good, White should turn at 'a', this way Black can't settle down, it is Black's burden all the time.];B[dh]
;W[bh];B[ai]C[B47 is good move, Black already lives cleanly. White incurs loss.];W[fg]LB[eh:a][bj:b][bk:c][ag:d]C[In the process, with B49, Black definitely can't connect at 'a', otherwise W 'b', B 'c' and W 'd', Black has no eye.];B[cg];W[eh];B[bk];W[qc];B[pc];W[ke]
;B[kd];W[ie]LB[jd:a]C[W56 is the root cause leading to White's defeat.

;B[mb];W[kc];B[ld];W[ak]LB[ma:a]C[W68: White seeks to create ko threats and makes ko tenaciously at 'a'.];B[kb]C[But Black takes tenuki with B69, White can't kill all black stones.];W[af];B[ek];W[el];B[aj];W[ah];B[al]
