Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[In fast games, since you can't think through all variations, the situation changes quite frequently, being turned around is also very common. In the preliminary round 4 of Ahan Tongshan Cup, Chang Hao didn't grab the winning chance against Yu Bin and failed to advance to the main event.];W[pp];B[cd];W[cp];B[ec];W[od]
;B[oc];W[pd];B[pc];W[qe];B[nc];W[rd];B[qc];W[qj]C[In the opening, the shape of W14 is interesting, normally only Black can play this way.];B[ep];W[eq];B[fq];W[dq];B[qg]C[Black invades with B19, recently Chang Hao always initiates fight in the game.]
;W[of];B[og];W[pg]LB[pf:a]C[W22 is not to White's advantage, to retreat at 'a' is the original move.];B[qf];W[pe];B[ph];W[pf];B[pj];W[qh]C[W28: White takes two stones and it forms an exchange, Black is not bad.];B[qi];W[rh]
;B[ri];W[oh];B[pi];W[rf];B[qn];W[nq];B[rp];W[kq];B[cj];W[lc];B[jc];W[kd];B[jd]LB[rc:a]C[B43: Black takes a big risk, the original move is to make life directly at 'a'.]
;W[pm]LB[je:a][ie:b][rb:c]C[W44: For White to hane at 'a' is better, as to this, if Black follows to hane at 'b', White can jump to 'c' to kill the corner, White can obtain a very big territory and can fight.];B[sh];W[ke]C[The retreat of W46 allows Black take advantage, White can't be satisfied.];B[rc];W[qm]LB[rg:a]C[W48: White still should take at 'a'.];B[rg]C[In the game, Black takes with B49, it is too big! Since this is related to both sides' thickness and thinness.];W[qq]
;B[ng];W[mf];B[rm];W[rl]LB[pn:a]C[W54: White ends in gote and it is not that meaningful, to take sente directly at 'a' is relatively better.];B[rn];W[ol];B[rq];W[rr];B[qp];W[pq];B[po];W[oo]
;B[pn];W[on];B[mg];W[lg];B[nf];W[me];B[lh];W[kg];B[ni]C[From B65 to B71, Black takes advantage in sente, Black is leading.];W[kh];B[nm]LB[jq:a]C[B73: Black can consider to attach at 'a' directly, at this situation, to make life locally is more substantial.]
;W[nl];B[jp];W[jq];B[ip];W[fp];B[kp];W[cl];B[lm];W[mm];B[mn]C[B83 is a crude move and should be reserved.];W[ml];B[dl]C[B85 is a good move, expanding himself and also condensing White, one stone for two birds.]

;B[fo];W[gp];B[go];W[gq];B[fh];W[gf];B[do]LB[dn:a]C[B105 is a little unreasonable, to play at 'a' is relatively better.];W[sm];B[sn];W[bj];B[bi];W[dk]C[W108 and W110 are game-deciding moves! If White plays endgame steadily, White is a little inferior.]
;B[ek];W[ej];B[eh];W[fj];B[dg];W[ho];B[hn];W[in]LB[em:a]C[W118: White should first play at 'a' and make Black heavy, then the hane of W118 is the most fierce move.];B[hp];W[em];B[gr];W[fr]
;B[hq];W[fq];B[hm]LB[im:a][jm:b]C[B125: Black turns the body around alertly! Otherwise Black is very dangerous to fight here. However with B125, for Black to hane at 'a' is much better.];W[fl];B[ef];W[jm]C[In the game, White is left with the tactic of W128, Black's big dragon has no enough eye space and Black will be exploited, in the end Black just loses the game here.];B[io];W[qk];B[sq];W[kb]
;B[bk];W[bl];B[aj];W[fg];B[ff];W[gg];B[fe];W[dh];B[ch];W[kn]C[W142: White must take advantage in the center, otherwise White's territory is inadequate, next Chang Hao makes mistake and loses the game regrettably.];B[jl];W[kl];B[gk]

;B[ii]LB[gj:a][lq:b][lr:c][kr:d]C[B159: Black should first make one eye at 'a', since at the bottom Black has the tactic of B 'b', W 'c' and B 'd', Black's big dragon is not difficult to live.];W[gj];B[ln];W[km];B[li]LB[lq:a]C[The most fatal is B163, Black clearly forgets to first play the hane-and-connect at 'a'.];W[lp]C[This way, comparing with the hane of W164 in the game, it has a difference of at least 4 points. So far, the situation becomes closer again.];B[lo]
;W[mp];B[ko];W[mj];B[lj];W[mb];B[nb]LB[ne:a][nd:b][jb:c]C[B171 is the losing move! Black should push at 'a', after W 'b', Black can take tenuki and block at 'c', this way Black can achieve a small victory.];W[hc]C[W172 is severe!];B[hd];W[gc]
;B[nn];W[om];B[he]LB[ic:a][ib:b]C[B177: If Black bumps at 'a', after W 'b', it will lead to a ko fight, however White is thick on the board, Black clearly doesn't have enough ko threats.];W[jb]C[W178: White crosses over in sente and obtains a big profit.];B[fb];W[ir];B[ic];W[ib];B[co];W[bo]
;B[hr];W[dp];B[eo];W[gh];B[gb];W[hb];B[ei];W[nj];B[mi];W[ji]C[In the end, White grabs the big endgame of W194, the situation has been turned around completely.];B[kj];W[ij];B[sd]
