;W[qj];B[do];W[co];B[cn];W[cp];B[dm];W[en];B[dn];W[ep];B[cf];W[di];B[dd]C[Gu Li's opening is very painful, and he is forced to play on the first line. The reason is, generally regarded by pros, he fails in the upper-left corner fight.];W[cd]
;B[ec]C[Although most people think Gu Li's two moves of B17 and B19 are self-assuring his strength more powerful, ...];W[cc];B[ed];W[ce];B[df];W[de]C[..., but after White plays push-and-cut with W24, Black indeed has no acceptable answer.];B[ee];W[ef]C[So we can say here Gu Li's play is really careless.];B[be];W[eg];B[ch];W[eb]

;W[dh];B[dp];W[eq]LB[cg:a]C[W46: However, White misses a good chance to "take Gu Li's life". Zhou Heyang and Wang Xi think, if White plays atari at 'a' right away, Black basically is going to collapse.];B[bf];W[ai];B[ah];W[bh];B[cq];W[bq];B[bi];W[ck];B[aj]
;W[dj];B[ak]C[Through B57, the fight on the left side is still very complicated. White elects to play more softly. Finally Gu Li has to seek life on the first line, too painful!];W[bc];B[cr];W[br];B[bn];W[bp];B[eo];W[fo];B[fn];W[go];B[gn];W[hn]
;B[fl];W[nq];B[qn];W[qg];B[lq]C[B73 is an asking move, later on Black may not have chance to play this anymore.];W[jq];B[ho]C[However B75 is again "careless". On the left side, Black just escapes from death but incurs a lot of damage. Now Black wants to attack opponent, this fits Gu Li's style but it is already very hard for him to control.];W[hm];B[io];W[fm];B[em];W[gm]
;B[en];W[gq];B[ek]C[Through B83, Zhou Ruiyang thinks, Black's big group is still alive completely, basically Black will be difficult to play.];W[hf]C[Zhou Heyang thinks, today Gu Li's play loses common sense.];B[jd];W[hj];B[hl];W[jn];B[gl];W[jm];B[hh]C[B87 and B91 are "good tempo", in fact Black just gives up two of his stones B75 and B77 unconditionally. Gu Li's play is really inexplicable.];W[gi]
;B[jl]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.];W[jo];B[jh];W[hd];B[gd];W[gg];B[ie];W[he];B[ic];W[bl];B[al];W[pr];B[ff]
