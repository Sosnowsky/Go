;B[pe];W[qk]C[W6 and W8 are Cho 9p's favorite play.];B[kc];W[qb];B[nd];W[nc];B[md];W[mc];B[ph]LB[ld:a]C[The attachment of B15 is to achieve efficiency, the common move is retreating at 'a'.];W[pi];B[oi]
;W[lc];B[ld];W[kd];B[jc];W[ke];B[gc];W[od];B[mf];W[pg]LB[oe:a][of:b][qi:c]C[W26: If White simply pushes at 'a', then Black will retreat at 26, this way next B 'b' and 'c' become miai, Black must get one to play, White can't be satisfied.];B[oh]
;W[oe];B[qg];W[rg]LB[qi:a][of:b][qf:c][pf:d]C[The atari of W30 is a mistake. White certainly should simply connect at 'a', if Black still plays hane at 'b', White can play atari at 'c', next B 'd' and W30.];B[qf];W[qi];B[of];W[qn];B[cf]C[Through B36, Black already obtains a clear advantage.];W[id]
;B[ic];W[fd]C[White seals off Black strongly with W36 and W38, it appears far-fetched.];B[gd];W[ge];B[fe];W[df];B[he];W[gf];B[ff];W[fg];B[gg];W[hf];B[eg]
;W[fh];B[de];W[dg];B[ee];W[ce];B[cd];W[be];B[ed];W[eh];B[dc]C[From B41 to B59, Black takes one stone, Black obtains a lot of territory and can be satisfied.
];W[hd];B[hc];W[cn]LB[hg:a]C[W62: If White strengthens at 'a', White's speed is too slow, although for Black to atari out at 'a' is very big.]

;W[fk];B[dm];W[cq];B[cp];W[dq];B[ep]LB[bq:a]TR[dm]C[B81: For Black to hane at 'a' is better, because Black already has the marked stone (B77).];W[bp];B[bo];W[bq];B[co];W[fq]
;B[ch]LB[ci:a][bg:b]C[The set pattern from B87 to B93 is too crude! With B87 Black should play at 'a' or make the diagonal at 'b'.];W[cg];B[bg];W[bf];B[bi];W[dh];B[di];W[bc];B[nq]LB[bb:a]C[B95 breaks away from the main battle field. Black should attach at 'a', not allowing White's big group make life, this is imperative!]
;W[cb]C[The diagonal of W96 is huge, not only giving himself eye shape and also obtaining some points. Now the situation is close.];B[hq];W[gq];B[hp];W[fo];B[dn];W[kp];B[jo];W[mp];B[pn];W[pm];B[on];W[ln]
;B[qo];W[rn];B[lr]LB[jl:a]C[The knight's move of B111 is the losing cause of this game! Here it is not a place to play. Black should jump to 'a', the center connection is related to thickness and thinness of both sides' shape.];W[jm]LB[kh:a][me:b][lg:c]C[In the game, after White caps with W112, the situation has been turned around. Because Black still has to press at 'a' to strengthen one move, Black is very painful. The proper way to set the shape here in the future is, B 'b' and W 'c', therefore B 'a' is not a place to play.];B[kh];W[jp];B[io];W[jr]
;B[ir]LB[gr:a][fr:b][ko:c][lo:d][lq:e]C[B117 is the last losing move of this game. Black can only hane at 'a', next W 'b', B 'c' and W 'd', this way Black can make sure after the sente move of B 'e', Black can still hang at 117.];W[kr];B[lq];W[hn];B[ko];W[lp];B[lo];W[mo]
;B[kn];W[oq]C[After the attachment of W126, Black's defeat is already decided.];B[np];W[op];B[or];W[oo];B[pr];W[mq];B[nr];W[nn];B[lm];W[mn];B[km]
