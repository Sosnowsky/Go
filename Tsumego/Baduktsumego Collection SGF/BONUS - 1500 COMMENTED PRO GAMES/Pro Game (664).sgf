;W[ce];B[dh];W[od];B[oe];W[qc];B[pd];W[pc];B[ne];W[nc];B[ld];W[lb]C[White's sequence from W8 to W16 is thick.];B[cn]C[Black attacks with the pincer of B17, Black is positive.]
;W[do];B[dn];W[fp];B[gq];W[eo]C[W20 and W22 are calm moves.];B[fq]LB[dr:a]C[B23 is rare, perhaps Black should seek to counterattack with the small diagonal at 'a'.
];W[fm];B[dk];W[dr]C[W24 and W26 are steady moves.];B[jq];W[qj]LB[rs:a]C[White is able to grab the super-big point with W28, White's situation is better.]
;B[qn]C[B29: Black seeks a chance to initiate fight.];W[qf]C[W30: White attacks Black's weak point.];B[rc]C[The hane of B31 is a good move locally.];W[re];B[rd];W[pf];B[nd];W[oc];B[pe];W[kc]C[The sequence from W32 to W38 is good tempo.];B[ql]
;W[ph]C[Through W40, White's whole game configuration is good, Black's opening is not good.];B[nq]C[B41: Black hopes to redeem loss here.];W[np];B[mp];W[oq];B[no];W[op];B[nr];W[mo]LB[mq:a][or:b][pr:c][lq:d][qr:e][qp:f]C[W48 is not good, White can consider to cut at 'a', if Black turns at 'b', then W 'c', B 'd' and W 'f', White most likely will take sente and establish superiority.]
;B[mn];W[lo];B[on]C[B49 and B51 are strong moves.];W[or];B[lq];W[rp];B[cd]C[Black gets to play the big point with B55, the situation becomes closer.];W[de];B[fc];W[ln];B[rj];W[ri]
;B[lm];W[hp];B[iq];W[km];B[ll]C[After this move, it is time for lunch break.];W[kl];B[kn]LB[lk:a]C[B67: Black should extend at 'a', this way it is still a long game.];W[mm];B[nn];W[lk];B[ml]
;W[mk];B[nl];W[lp]C[The cut of B67 is miscalculation, with two ataris of W70 and W72, White obtains huge profit, plus White has the strong atari of W74, Black's situation is not good.];B[jn];W[mq];B[mr]C[B77: Black is far-fetched.];W[kq];B[lr]LB[nk:a]C[When W78, with B79 Black can't take ko and is very painful. Now White should press at 'a', Black takes ko, White can atari several stones as handy ko threat and then take the ko back, this way Black almost can't tolerate.];W[jp];B[ip];W[kr]C[W80 and W82: White wants to win the game at one stroke.]
;B[kp];W[ko];B[mp];W[ch]C[W86: White finds ko threats.];B[mq];W[di];B[jo]LB[hq:a]C[B87: Black can only eliminate the ko, leading to a push-and-cut tactic at 'a', Black spends one more move with B89.];W[fj];B[bj];W[eh]LB[ck:a][cl:b][cj:c]C[W90 and W92 are slow. With W90 White should attach at 'a', next B 'b' and W 'c', White hopefully can win big.]
;B[je];W[bo];B[bn];W[el];B[bl];W[hc];B[kk]C[Following B99, the situation again becomes closer.];W[kj];B[jk];W[jj];B[ik];W[ij];B[hk]
;W[rb];B[sb];W[ra];B[kd];W[bi];B[dj];W[dl]C[W112 are dangerous endgame tactic.];B[co];W[bp];B[dp]LB[en:a][fn:b][ej:c][br:d]TR[do][eo]C[B115: If Black first pushes at 'a', next W 'b', B115, White can only connect at 'c', B 'd', White's two key stones will be captured, White fails.]
;W[en];B[cl];W[im];B[gl];W[dq];B[ep];W[io]C[The purpose of W118 and W122 is not clear.];B[in];W[fl];B[br];W[bq];B[hj];W[dm]
;B[er]C[B129: Black loses a multi-ko tactic in the corner, it is a pity.];W[cr];B[cj];W[ei];B[aj];W[hn];B[kp];W[mi];B[he]LB[jc:a][jb:b][lc:c][kb:d][mc:e][mb:f][mg:g]C[B137 is Black's first losing move. Black should play hane at 'a' in sente, next W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 'e', W 'f' and B 'g', this way Black's situation is not bad.]

;W[ee];B[ff];W[df];B[qb];W[pb];B[gp]LB[mg:a]C[B169 is small and the last losing move. If Black plays the vital expansion/reduction point at 'a', Black still can fight.];W[mf]C[W170 is a good and winning move, White's situation is already leading. In the end Black's big dragon dies, White achieves a big victory. ];B[kg];W[lg];B[kh];W[ih]
