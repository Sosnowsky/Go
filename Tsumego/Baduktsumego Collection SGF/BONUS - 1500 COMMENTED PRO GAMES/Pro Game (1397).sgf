;B[fd];W[qc];B[kd];W[rd];B[qe];W[re];B[pc];W[qb];B[eb]C[The sequence from B1 to B15 is Gu Li's favorite opening, in National Team tournaments, he uses it very often.];W[be];B[cd];W[ch];B[cn]
;W[ck];B[fq];W[fp];B[gp];W[fo];B[dq];W[cq]LB[eq:a]C[W26 is almost the losing move, White can only wedge at 'a'.];B[eq];W[cp];B[dl]C[B29 is severe.];W[cl]
;B[dm];W[fm];B[dk];W[dj];B[ej];W[di];B[fk]LB[ep:a]C[Through B37, Black sticks his head out easily and also is left with the cut at 'a', White is no good.];W[ip];B[ho];W[io];B[hn];W[gl]
;B[hq];W[iq];B[hr];W[il];B[in];W[jn];B[jm];W[im];B[kn];W[jo];B[km];W[ir]LB[ep:a]C[White's moves from W46 to W54 is very farfetched, but because of the cut at 'a', White seems to have no other choice.]
;B[cr];W[br];B[ds];W[do];B[lp]C[Through B59, White's losing trend is very obvious.];W[lr];B[kp];W[mq];B[kr];W[ks];B[kq];W[op];B[js]

;B[dh];W[ee]C[White has no alternative but to play W82, Black in the center couldn't be killed.];B[cg];W[ed];B[bh]C[An exchange has resulted from W70 to B85, White doesn't gain anything by attacking Black and instead incurs some loss.];W[ic];B[ro];W[mn];B[mm];W[nm];B[ml];W[nl]
;B[mk];W[nk];B[mj];W[je];B[cc];W[db];B[ce];W[ke];B[nj]C[Through B101, Black already is very hard to lose this game.];W[ls];B[jr]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.];W[ef]
;B[cb];W[ca];B[pn]C[The attack of B17 is very severe.];W[oq];B[on];W[nn];B[mp];W[np];B[nr];W[or];B[pr];W[mo];B[ok]

;B[rp];W[om];B[lq];W[oo];B[pd];W[oc];B[pb];W[ob];B[pf];W[pa];B[rf]C[Through B141, Black is leading about 15+ points on the board.];W[nf];B[rc]
;W[rb];B[ba];W[da];B[ji];W[bo];B[bn];W[qg]C[Choi Cheolhan is very tenacious, if it were Lee Sedol, he probably would already concede defeat :-)];B[se];W[sc];B[qf];W[pg];B[rg];W[og]
;B[qi]C[Through B157, the board becomes "smaller", there is no place to stir a fight any more.];W[cf];B[bf];W[li];B[ki]C[In this game, Choi Cheolhan didn't give a play to his talent.];W[qh];B[rh];W[pi];B[pj];W[an];B[am];W[lg]
