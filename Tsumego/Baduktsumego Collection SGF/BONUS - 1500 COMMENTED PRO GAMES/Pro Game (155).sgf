;W[mp];B[po];W[jp];B[cn];W[cl];B[cf]C[Both sides are very careful in the opening, it most likely will be a prolonged battle.];W[fc];B[en];W[fq];B[dk];W[co];B[ck]LB[bn:a]C[The block of B17 is simple, if Black descends at 'a', then White would crawl at 17, the variation is complicated.]
;W[bn];B[cm];W[nc];B[pf];W[pb];B[qc];W[ld]LB[kc:a][jc:b]C[W24: White can also consider to make the two-space extension at 'a', in the real game, the invasion of B 'b' is obviously a good point.];B[jc];W[kc];B[ke];W[mf]
;B[kd];W[lc];B[id];W[bd];B[qb]C[W32 and B33 are equally big points.];W[ff];B[kh];W[mh];B[dg];W[hc];B[hd];W[gd];B[hb]
;W[qi];B[mr]C[The large knight's move of B43 is unexpected, the common thinking is always to attack W42 first, however Xie He is good at striking powerfully only after the enemy has struck, B43 is his unique conception.];W[qg];B[qf];W[pn];B[on];W[pm]LB[qm:a]C[W46 and W48 seem heavy, can't agree with, for White to invade simply at 'a' is much powerful.];B[oo];W[rm];B[qj]C[The bump of B51 is a strong move! White already can't look after both sides.];W[ro]
;B[rq]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.];W[qp];B[oq];W[om];B[pi];W[ph];B[oi];W[oh];B[nh]LB[ng:a][ni:b][og:c][mi:d]C[The sequence of B57 to B61 is the follow-up maneuver of B51, if White doesn't want to give up four stones and ataris at 'a' instead, then B 'b', W 'c' and B 'd', Black's center will be very thick, White is even worse.]
;W[ni];B[ng];W[nj];B[ok];W[mg];B[og];W[nk]C[W68: White ends in gote and has clearly incurred some loss.];B[ge];W[fe];B[gb]C[B71 is not only a big move and also related to Black's own eye shape.];W[gc];B[fb]
;W[ec];B[ic]C[Through 75, Black's situation is not bad.];W[ci]C[The invasion of W76 is a game-deciding move.];B[bm]LB[eh:a][bl:b]C[If Black answers at around 'a', White will initiate a fight by playing the descent at 'b', the variation is complicated. In the real game, the turn of B77 is calm.];W[ch];B[eh];W[bf];B[bo]C[Although White crosses over with W78 and W80, but Black takes one stone with B81 and also has some gains.

Here there is no loophole for White to take advantage of, Black should crawl at 'a' to exchange with W 'b', then jump to 'c', Black's advantage would be clear.]
;W[ms];B[nr];W[eb]LB[kg:a][jg:b][jh:c][lg:d][ki:e][kf:f][ih:g][ej:h][mn:i]C[Although W98 is also very big, however if White attaches at 'a' to exchange, up to 'h', then the jump at 'i' is much bigger, this way the game would be already turned around.];B[mn]C[After Black jumps with B99, the game already becomes very close.]

;B[sp];W[pc];B[qd];W[so];B[pp]LB[sq:a][gf:b]C[B269 is inexplicable! Now only if Black simply connects at 'a', Black will win the game by half point. If White pushes at 269, then Black will push at 'b', there are no other endgame moves left. In this simple situation, Xie He didn't connect, I guess he probably has miscounted or thought the komi is 7.5 which is same as Chinese Go rule, for the right answer, you have to go and ask Xie He himself.];W[sq];B[bc];W[bb];B[sp];W[hm];B[jn]
