;B[fc];W[hc];B[pj]C[Yoda rarely uses the sanrensei opening.];W[nc];B[pf];W[kc]LB[pb:a]C[The two-space extension of W12 is over-steady, normally White will make the knight's move at 'a', however Lee Changho elects to play this way, it is perhaps one of his strategies.];B[jp];W[cc];B[pn]LB[jj:a][qq:b]C[B15 seems normal, in fact Black should play at 'a' to take the highest point, because Black's stones are all in high positions, not fearing White to strike in the corner by playing at 'b'.]
;W[jj];B[fh]C[After W16, Black invades into White's moyo with B17, Black is passive.];W[fe];B[fk];W[dk];B[jh]TR[jj]C[Black seems to threaten the marked white stone with B19 and B21, but the marked white stone doesn't worry White at all.];W[lj];B[hh];W[he]C[White takes territory with W20 and W24 patiently. In the opening phase, Black sinks into a difficult situation very earlier on.];B[dj];W[cj]
;B[di];W[ek];B[fj]LB[ll:a][nd:b]C[Black again strengthens with B25, B27 and B29, it is slow. Black certainly should attach at 'b' before White jumps at 'a', in the game Black clearly is one step slow.];W[ll];B[nd];W[md];B[me];W[od];B[ne];W[pc];B[oe]
;W[oc];B[qd];W[jm]C[With W40 White forms a fortress in the center, Black's attack totally fails.
];B[kn]C[With the sequence following B41, Black has to continue attacking, because it is very hard to enclose all side territory.];W[jn];B[ko];W[qq]C[White takes the chance to enter the corner with W44, it is inevitable.];B[pq];W[rp];B[rn];W[pr];B[or]
;W[qr];B[km]C[The sequence following B51 is the continuation of B41, but "Stone Buddha" already has full assurance of success.];W[kl];B[ik];W[il];B[jk];W[jl];B[gm];W[ip];B[iq];W[ho]C[Next after the attachment of W58, the diagonal extension of W60 is a good move to get out of trouble.];B[gp]
;W[hk];B[ij];W[hq];B[hp];W[io];B[jq];W[fn];B[dr]C[	];W[hj];B[ii];W[gl]TR[gm]C[Through W72, White not only lives but also captures the marked black stone, Black is already in a losing situation.]

First, before B85, Black should play hane at 'a', White needs to reinforce at 'b', this is Black's priviledge, in the game White clamps at 'c', because the corner itself is ko-killing, White has too many local ko threats, so Black ahs to give up the ko reluctantly.]

Yoda suffers a big defeat in his big-moyo fight.];B[cr];W[bq];B[ep]
