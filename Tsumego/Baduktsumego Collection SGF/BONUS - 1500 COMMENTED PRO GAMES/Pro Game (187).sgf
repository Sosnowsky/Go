;B[eq];W[qo];B[pm];W[lp]LB[oo:a][on:b][qm:c]C[W8 is rarely seen, the common play is to jump at 'a' or knight at 'b' or attach under at 'c'.];B[po];W[iq];B[qp]C[W8 and W10 are favorite turnaround moves by Japanese players, Black has obtained territory and can be satisfied.];W[dq];B[fc]LB[ep:a][dn:b]C[If B13 extends to 'a', then W 'b' will knight attack, leading to a fierce fight.]
;W[df];B[jd];W[ep];B[cj]LB[ck:a][ci:b][cn:c]C[If B17 is played as the splitting move at 'a', then after W 'b' and B 'c', Black is too close to White's thickness.];W[qf];B[re]C[Because Black is very thick in the lower right, B19 wouldn't allow White to get in the corner to initiate an exchange, instead Black drives White to his thickness, this is commonsense of Go logic.];W[pi];B[pg]LB[of:a]C[B21 is seldom seen, the knight's move at 'a' is usual.]
;W[pl]C[W22 aims to settle oneself lightly, Black in the lower right is already very thick, allowing Black to become more thicker has nothing to lose.];B[ol];W[qm];B[qn];W[om];B[pn];W[rf];B[oe];W[qe];B[qd];W[rd];B[rc];W[se]
;B[cm]C[The two-space extension of B35 is a big point.];W[lc]C[W36 invading to wreck Black's territory is a huge move.];B[nc]LB[oc:a][pb:b]C[B37 is the vital point, otherwise White is left with some good plays such as 'a' and 'b', Black is not comfortable.];W[le];B[jb];W[ci]LB[di:a][ch:b][dj:c][db:d]C[W40 seeks to obtain sente, for example, B 'a', W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', this way White can be satisfied.]

(;B[de]LB[gd:a][ec:b][fe:c][ed:d][gc:e][cd:f]C[If B51 hanes at 'a', then W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 'e' and W 'f', White makes life on the spot, Black can not be satisfied (see var a).];W[gc]LB[ee:a][cd:b][dc:c][cc:d]TR[fc]C[If W52 blocks at 'a', then B 'b', W 'c' and B 'd', the marked black stone is right on the vital point of White's shape, White is no good.]
;B[cd];W[ec];B[ee];W[el];B[pk];W[io]C[Through 58, White's moyo at the bottom is magnificent, on the other hand Black's territory is more secure, the key for the game now is how much territory White's moyo at the bottom can encircle.];B[hm]LB[gn:a][fm:b][fn:c][bk:d]C[The invading point of B59 is very cunning, if White knights at 'a', then B 'b' piercing through; if W 'c' gives way, then Black can tenuki, and later Black can cut and atari at 'd',  White's territory is not that big.];W[lg];B[ng]LB[of:a][qh:b]C[B61 defends Black's crosscutting at 'a', and also aims to make the diagonal move at 'b'.]
;W[rh]LB[ql:a]C[W62 strengthens oneself and also seeks to connect at 'a' afterwards.];B[lr]LB[nq:a]C[Comparing B63 to White's knight at 'a', it makes a vast difference.];W[nd]LB[lb:a]C[W64 probes Black, aiming to take sente and prevent Black from crossing over at 'a'.];B[ne]LB[oc:a]C[If B65 directly retreats at 'a', then after W 65, White's eye shapes are very good.];W[md];B[oc];W[jf]

;W[eo];B[fm]LB[bk:a]C[Because Black has the maneuver of cutting at 'a', B81 attaches less importance on White's territory on the left.];W[fo]LB[em:a]C[W82 is reluctant to block at 'a', preparing to strongly attack Black.];B[em];W[dm];B[dr];W[er];B[dl];W[dn];B[cl]
