;B[dp];W[dq];B[co];W[fq]C[The opening up to the extension of W10 is same as that of the first game, showing Gueon Hyojin is very confident with this.];B[cj]C[B11 starts to vary, it is also my study result after the first game.];W[bp];B[de]C[B13: Some pros also suggest expanding to both sides by playing at 'a', however I don't like allowing White to break up the situation by playing at 13.]LB[kd:a];W[kc];B[ic];W[oc];B[mc]
;W[pe]C[W18: The common shape is to crawl at 'a', followed by the sequence up to the diagonal extension at 'd', in this variation White takes outside influence and Black gets territory. From the whole board's viewpoint, Black can't allow White to form a thick wall, the reason is very simple, if White becomes thick here, it will clearly contain Black's left side expansion, so Black must be consistent with the previous thinking.]LB[qe:a][pf:b][qg:c][ld:d];B[pd];W[od];B[oe]C[The push and cut of B19 and B21 are imperative, I already prepare for the fight, thinking White will extend out at 'a', next it will probably proceed to the hane at 'n', Black already achieves the goal of preventing White from becoming thick (see var a). Of course, the variation here is relatively complicated, but only if Black can get to extend at 'b', the left side will be under Black's control.]LB[pf:a][ne:b][qb:c][rf:d][qg:e][rb:f][pb:g][rc:h][mb:i][lc:j][lb:k][kd:l][kb:m][jd:n]

(;W[ne];B[of];W[md];B[pf]TR[kc]C[W22 and W24 are the simplest play, aiming to play thick but not tangle too much and contain Black's expansion on the left side. But White completely didn't expect that White would have a big defect in the shape with W22, W24 and W14, the common shape in joseki is that the marked white stone should be at 'a'.]LB[lc:a];W[qm]C[W26: White proceeds as planned.];B[lc]C[Black can't wait to push and attack with B27, it is very severe.
];W[kd];B[ld];W[le];B[ke]
;W[je];B[kf];W[kb]C[Gueon Hyojin has used a lot of time here, it seems she is relatively strange with the shape, now White already can't avoid being sealed off by Black. The atari of W32 seems vulgar, descending at 34 is better.];B[lf];W[me];B[jd];W[ej]C[The reduction of W38 is what Black wants, suppose if White has a very thick wall in the upper right corner, then White definitely dares invade at 'a' or 'b'.]LB[cg:a][gc:b];B[pb];W[ob];B[jc]
;W[mb];B[ch];W[cc];B[cd];W[ec];B[cb];W[ie];B[hd];W[ig];B[jb];W[lb];B[gf]C[Through B53, Black encloses a big territory very easily.];W[db]
;B[dd];W[ca];B[bb];W[ii];B[nf];W[ik]C[White clearly has no choice but to continue getting out with W60, otherwise if Black gets to play cap at 60, White would sink into passivity.];B[gh]LB[hh:a][ih:b][gj:c]C[B61 is favorable consciousness and lacks initiative, here the positive play is to peep at 'a' then fly out at 'c', besides the exchange of B61 and W62 is most likely a damaging play.];W[gj];B[qk]
;W[pk];B[qj];W[pj];B[qi];W[pi]C[Black extends with B63 and White attaches with W64, Black loses balance by grabbing territory in the following sequence, perhaps playing steadily is not bad. The thinking logic in the game time is "absolutely not afraid of any challenge, because I already has no way to back up, I can only fight desperately in order to win. "!];B[mf];W[nc];B[lq];W[qh];B[rh];W[rg]C[W74 is unnecessary, it is not good to fight in front of Black's thick wall, besides it is so easy to get into trouble.];B[ph]
;W[qg];B[ql];W[pl];B[rm]C[The sequence following B75 is fighting spirit from both sides, but sometimes if you overly rely on the momentum to carry on the game, it is hard not to lose calmness.];W[ri];B[rj];W[sh];B[qn];W[pm];B[ro];W[re];B[qe];W[pn]
;B[qq];W[rd]C[The crawl of W90 is a move that Gueon Hyojin regretted after the game, she thinks White should block at 'a', then B90 and White strengthens to make life, then Black makes the extension at 'b', this is normal sequence from both sides. In terms of W90, we can see Gueon Hyojin already lacks calmness!]LB[pq:a][iq:b];B[or]C[With B91, Black all connects together, White's influence becomes Black's territory.];W[nq];B[oq];W[op];B[nr];W[qc]C[W96: Gueon Hyojin regretted again, it is too small, even if White wants to play, a move at 'a' is better, the invasion at 'b' is also huge.]LB[mi:a][cl:b]
;B[li];W[lk];B[qf];W[pc];B[jh];W[ih];B[ji];W[jj];B[dl]C[B105: At that time I feel my advantage is very big, the current task is how to safely close out the game.];W[jg];B[ni];W[mj];B[rf]

;W[nk];B[lj];W[mk];B[mi]C[B165 is a questionable move, Black should first exchange B 'a' and W 'b', then connect at 165. Endgame is my weak category, especially in fast games, it is indeed scary time.]LB[km:a][ll:b];W[km];B[hp]C[With the set pattern following the attachment of B167, Black clearly encloses less territory than White.];W[gp];B[go];W[ho];B[ip]

;W[ef];B[dg];W[ja]C[W200 is a one-point damaging, the right order is to first play atari at 'a', after Black connects at 'b', then play hane at 200.]LB[id:a][hc:b];B[ia];W[ka];B[ee];W[ha];B[ib];W[ks];B[fk]LB[gk:a][hk:b][hj:c][fl:d]C[B207 is not right, Black should attach at 'a', then W207, B 'b', W 'c' and B 'd', this way Black would be 3 points better off.]

Overall, Black's victory lies in the upper-right variation, White clearly underperforms.]
