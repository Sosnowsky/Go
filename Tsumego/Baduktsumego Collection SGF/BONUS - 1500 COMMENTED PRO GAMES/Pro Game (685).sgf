Translation:GoGameWorld.];B[pd]C[Yu Bin and Xie He defeated Kong Jie and Liu Shizhen respectively in the semi finals of the 18th Chinese Tianyuan Title, this is an important match to decide who will be the final challenger. ];W[dd];B[pq];W[dq];B[qo]C[B1, B3 and B5 are steady opening.]
;W[jq];B[co]LB[do:a]C[Next with B7, Black can also approach at 'a', this way Black would attach at 7 to take territory.];W[dl];B[ip]LB[eo:a][ep:b]C[B9: Black is reluctant to jump out at 'a' or knight-press at 'b', the shoulder-hit in the game is a common tactic.];W[iq];B[hp]LB[gp:a]C[However, the ensuing extension of B11 seems heavy, jumping at 'a' instead is relatively light.];W[hq]
;B[gp]LB[do:a]C[Black again extends B13, carrying the mistake to the end! It just helps White to attach out and cut at 'a'.];W[do];B[dp];W[ep];B[cp];W[eo];B[cq];W[fq]C[Through W20, White crosses over, Black's three stones are isolated, Black's failure is doubtless.];B[cf]LB[dr:a]C[B21: Certainly Black can only play atari at 'a', in the game after White stands at 'a', White's shape is too good, and the approaching direction of B21 also becomes very questionable.]
;W[dr];B[cm];W[ce];B[df];W[fd];B[dm];W[di];B[bk];W[nc];B[kc]LB[qf:a]C[B31: Black usually will answer with the small knight's move at 'a', in the game Black aims to create complications.];W[qf]C[After the double approach of W32, the game enters into the middle game fight.]
;B[pf];W[pg];B[qe];W[of];B[pe];W[rf];B[nd];W[md];B[ne];W[me]LB[mc:a]C[White has no choice but to answer with the crude move of W42, if entering the corner directly, Black's cut at 'a' would be effective.];B[nf];W[qc]
;B[re];W[ob];B[hc];W[gb]LB[qh:a]C[W48: White should consider to take tenuki and strengthen at 'a'.];B[qi]LB[qj:a]C[The sequence following B49 is a little vulgar, with B49, Black can consider to check at 'a'.];W[pi];B[pj];W[oi];B[qh];W[qg]
;B[mi];W[nj];B[pk];W[mj];B[ki];W[lj];B[ke]LB[lf:a][li:b][kf:c]C[The jump of B61 allows White to get out with the diagonal at 'a', and Black himself still needs to connect at 'b', Black fails, with B61 Black should jump-seal at 'c' instead.];W[lf];B[ng];W[og]
;B[li];W[om];B[qm];W[pn];B[po];W[kf]C[After White presses out with W70, the situation becomes chaotic, it seems White is better off.];B[kj];W[kk];B[jk];W[jl];B[kl];W[lk];B[ik]
;W[jm];B[jf];W[jg];B[ig]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.];W[ih];B[jh];W[kg];B[if];W[ii];B[jj]C[B87: Black has to connect this way sorrowfully, White's advantage is obvious.];W[gi]LB[hm:a][gk:b][gg:c]TR[gp][ip][hp][ih][ii]SQ[cf][df]C[The jump of W88 is unnecessary, and in fact it is a questionable move! White should jump to 'a' instead, this way he marked three black stones already have no way to escape. Next Black most likely will jump out at 'b', White can fly out at 'c' treating the two marked white stones lightly, and also White would have a chance to capture the two square-marked black stones, this variation is simple and clear.]
;B[hm];W[gk]LB[km:a]C[The jump of W90 is a big mistake! White must have neglected that Black unexpectedly can attach out at 'a'.];B[km];W[ql];B[rl];W[rm];B[qn];W[kn];B[lm];W[rk];B[pl];W[sl]

(;W[mn]LB[mp:a][ol:b][nm:c][mo:d][lo:e][lp:f]C[W108 is the last losing move, this move causes White has to press out at 'a' in gote. The correct play of W108 is to push at 'b', Black blocks and White connects at 'c' in sente, then W 'd', B 'e' and W 'f', White has a chance to grab sente, the variation would be complicated, the outcome of the game is still not clear (see var a).];B[lo];W[mo];B[lp];W[ol];B[ok];W[nm]
;B[nk];W[mp];B[rh]C[B117: Black gets to strike first, White's big dragon already couldn't escape from being captured.];W[sj]C[W118: White manages to start a ko.];B[sg]C[But B119 is a good move, it leads to a double ko, White is killed unconditionally. White collapses while in a favorable situation, it is really pity!];W[pr];B[oq];W[or];B[qr];W[rr];B[nr];W[mr]
