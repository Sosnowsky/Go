;B[bb];W[eb];B[bg];W[bf];B[bh];W[bd]C[Zhou Junxun elects to play the very complicated "large avalanche" joseki, obviously he is well prepared.];B[fc]
(;W[eg]LB[dh:a][ad:b][ae:c][fb:d][bi:e][ca:f]C[The extension of W26 is a new variation, in the past White will often connect at 'a', then B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e' and B 'f', this way both sides are steady (see var a).];B[fe];W[ci]C[After W28, there are a lot of variations and they are very complicated, due to the limitation of this article, I simply illustrate some variations.];B[ba];W[fb]LB[bi:a]C[W30: If White simply turns at 'a', then Black will also turn at 30, Black can be satisfied.]
;B[gb]LB[bi:a][bj:b][cj:c][gc:d]C[B31: Black can also try to find a way of playing by crawling at 'a', then W 'b' and B 'c', but this is probably very damaging, when Black plays B31 later on, White may no longer want to cut at 'd', instead White may strengthen the left side. Overall, the variation is very complicated.];W[gc];B[hb];W[ic];B[ib];W[ff]C[W34 and W36 again are new moves, I believe here Zhou Junxun must have done some research.]
(;B[gd]LB[ge:a][ee:b][ed:c][ef:d][fd:e][hf:f][hc:g][he:h]C[The atari of B37 is the losing cause of this game. Black can only extend at 'a', followed by W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 'e', W 'f', B 'g' and W 'h', this way although White is not bad either, but the result would be at least acceptable for both sides.];W[hc];B[gf];W[he];B[ge];W[hf]
;B[gg];W[jb];B[bi];W[bj];B[cj];W[bk];B[kb]LB[dh:a][ai:b][kc:c]C[In the game, White reduces one liberty with W38, W40 and W42 are again sente. Therefore White can play hane at 44, if Black wants to escape the three stones, Black can only clamp at 49, but Black's shape is not good. Although with B49 Black can capture three white stones by playing atari at 'a', but White can reduce liberties on the first line to crossover in sente by playing at 'b', then hang at 'c', Black would suffer more loss.];W[jc];B[ja];W[ia]
;B[ha];W[kc];B[lb]LB[ca:a]C[The original move of B55 is to reduce liberties by playing at 'a', but White can play the sente move at 55, Black can't tolerate, so Black elects to play such a farfetched ko as in the game, locally Black is already on the verge of collapse.];W[ka];B[ca];W[ia];B[dh];W[di];B[ja];W[ee];B[ed];W[ia]

;W[ef];B[fd];W[ej]C[W80: White gives up the ko fight, it is simple and clear, this ko is light for White but heavy for Black, and also White gains a considerable profit by capturing two black stones.];B[la];W[ih];B[nd]C[Through B83, the local exchange comes to an end, White's advantage is obvious.];W[gh]LB[hi:a]C[The attachment of W84 is not good, making the diagonal extension at 'a' is the shape, Black is already not easy to move out.];B[fh];W[ck];B[fj];W[fk]
;B[hj];W[gk];B[hg];W[ig];B[hh];W[ii];B[hi];W[jk]C[After the knight's move of W96, White's outside is not that thick.];B[fq];W[ep];B[dr];W[er]LB[cr:a]C[W100: For White to play the hane at 'a' is better.]
;B[eq];W[cr];B[dp];W[cq];B[fr];W[ds]C[Since White already played W104 with "fighting spirit", now White still wants to take at 106, after being ataried by B105, White is too grieved!];B[hk];W[eo];B[jj];W[ij];B[ik]C[B109 and B111 are good moves to create complications in an unfavorable situation.];W[kj]
;B[jl];W[ji];B[lk]C[White makes compromise with W112 and W114, allowing Black to play B113 and B115, the situation already becomes very close.];W[mi];B[iq];W[kq];B[mq];W[jo];B[ho];W[jm];B[kl];W[mp];B[np]
;W[im];B[hm];W[hl]LB[kp:a][il:b][mo:c]C[The wedge of W128 is too damaging to territory! Besides, Black still can cross over by attaching at 'a', White didn't gain much profit. With W128 White should cut at 'b', then B128 and W 'c'.];B[il];W[hn];B[gl];W[gn];B[kp];W[jp];B[jq]
;W[lp];B[kr];W[ko];B[lr];W[qn]C[Perhaps the earlier favorable consciousness makes White to play many questionable moves, through W140, after the situation becomes close, Zhou Junxun instead starts to play boldly.];B[qk];W[qf];B[pe];W[rd];B[rc];W[qi];B[pf];W[pg]
;B[og];W[ph];B[ok];W[qp];B[qq];W[rq];B[rr];W[re];B[nn];W[ro];B[sq];W[rm];B[qj]LB[go:a][fn:b][km:c]C[B161: Black has missed the last chance to turn the game around. Black should first attach at 'a' to probe White, if White retreats at 'b', then Black's turn at 'c' will be sente, although it is not guaranteed that Black can capture White, but at least due to the addition of one more stone, the chance would be bigger.]
