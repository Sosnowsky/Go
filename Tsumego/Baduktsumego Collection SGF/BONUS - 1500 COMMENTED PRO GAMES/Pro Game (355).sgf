;B[oq]LB[nq:a]C[B5 a small knight's move is common, but Yoo 9p rarely uses, in his games, it's much often to make a large knight's move at 'a'.];W[qj];B[de];W[dh]C[W8 two-space high pincer aims to build influence.];B[gd];W[ee];B[ef];W[fe];B[dd];W[fc];B[cc]

;B[cd];W[eg];B[bi];W[ci];B[bh]C[Through 33, it's the normal variation of "demon knife" joseki, as for this joseki Nie Weiping 9p thinks: Black's gain is limited, but White has too many other utilizations, Black is not good. In the game between Lee 9p and Zhou Heyang 9p, Zhou suffered losses on this joseki.];W[pp]C[W34 starts exploiting the aji on the upper left.];B[op];W[po];B[pq];W[qo]LB[fg:a]C[After W38 blocks, a ladder play at 'a' now is working.];B[fg]C[B39 has no choice.]
;W[eh];B[fh];W[qq];B[qr];W[rp]C[Through 44, White gains a lot in the lower right.];B[id]C[B45 begins attacking White.];W[ib]C[W46 responds lightly, White is very easy to make life on the upper side.];B[hb];W[hc];B[ic];W[gb];B[jb]
;W[ha];B[fj]TR[eh][eg][dh][ci]C[Through 53, White's four stones are difficult to rescue, but it's also too big to sacrifice. From the whole board configuration, Black is better.];W[kc]C[W54's strategy is: if you capture four stones on the left side, I will ruin your upper side. Black has no way to clearnly kill left four stones with just one move.];B[cn]C[B55 expands left side, and wants to capture White's four stones "in a big way".];W[en]C[W56 is the correct answer.];B[fq]C[B57 worths study, for both sides the potential on the lower side is not that big.];W[cq]C[W58 is simple and effective move.]
;B[ck];W[ip];B[fo];W[eo]C[Through 62, Black is hard to play on the lower side.];B[ho];W[io];B[hn];W[mq]C[W66 is very severe.];B[mp];W[lq];B[rq];W[hq]
;B[lp];W[kq];B[gq];W[ek]LB[ej:a][dk:b][dj:c][cl:d]C[W74 saves the four stones, if Black pushs through at 'a', then W 'b', B 'c' and W 'd'.];B[cj]C[B75 is patient.];W[nc];B[qf];W[pb];B[qc]
;W[jm]C[W80 is a thick and good move, coming out to attack Black and also taking care of White on the left side.];B[qp];W[hl];B[hr];W[ir];B[hp];W[iq];B[dr];W[cr];B[dq];W[ep];B[fp];W[co]
;B[bn];W[qq];B[oo]C[B95 is the key point for the shape.];W[on];B[qp];W[bc];B[bb];W[qq]C[White has abundant ko threats on the upper left corner, Black is hard to win this ko.];B[nn];W[om];B[nm];W[ol]C[Through 104, White encircles a lot of real territory, and Black on the lower right corner is still not alive, Black is not looking good.]
;B[fm];W[dn];B[fk];W[if]C[W108 starts attacking Black on the top.];B[md];W[mc];B[kd];W[ld];B[le];W[lc];B[ke];W[jc]C[Through 116, Black reduced White's territory on the top as much as possible.]
;B[qp];W[ab];B[db];W[qq];B[qh];W[ne]C[W122 cuts Black, but if Black on the lower side is alive, White is difficult to attack Black on the top, so the ko on the lower right corner is very important for both sides.];B[qp];W[el];B[pk]C[B125 is a strong and violent counter-attack.];W[qk];B[pl];W[qm]
;B[pn];W[pm];B[ro];W[qq];B[sp];W[qn];B[qp]LB[fl:a]C[Through 135, although Black won the ko fight, but because White's thrust at 'a' is sente, Black on the top will come under attack.];W[rh];B[rg];W[ph];B[kh]C[B139 is light and clever, if continue responding on the right, Black on the top side will be in danger.]

;B[af];W[ni]C[Now White has 25 points on the top, 10 points more on the right, total is more than 50 points; Black has 25 points on the left and 15 points on the upper right, and some points in the center, but it's too hard to surround 55 points.];B[mi];W[nj]LB[oh:a][of:b]C[If W156 at 'a', B156, W 'b' cuts, Black on the upper right corner is not completely alive, Lee didn't choose this variation, it's obvious he think he is better off.];B[oh];W[pi];B[of];W[ej];B[fi];W[gr]C[W160 and 162 are the biggest endgame points.]
