;W[cf];B[kc];W[po];B[qo]LB[qm:a]C[B9 is rarely seen, to play at 'a' is common.];W[qn];B[qp];W[pm];B[nq];W[qf]C[W14 is well prepared, if not doing any research, White dare not play such a risky move.];B[ql]C[B15: Black falls into the trap! In terms of research, Old Cho can't compare with young players.];W[rm]
;B[pl];W[ol];B[ok];W[nk]C[W18 and W20 are strong moves!];B[om]LB[oj:a][nl:b][qj:c]C[B21: If Black retreats at 'a', after White connects at 'b', Black leaves the defect at 'c', Black can't be satisfied.];W[nl];B[on]C[Black's counterattack with B21 and B23 is imperative.];W[qj]C[But the strike of W24 is a good move to sacrifice.]
;B[rl];W[oj];B[od];W[oo]LB[ph:a]C[Although the attachment of W28 is a gote move, but in the opening White obtains an overwhelming outside influence, White will be very favorable in the fight later on, the result is to White's advantage. Looking back, the earlier B15 perhaps should be played at 'a'.];B[pn];W[nn];B[qm];W[rn];B[cn];W[cl];B[dl]C[B35: Black aims to prevent White from connecting together and reduce White's outside influence.]
;W[dk];B[dm];W[ck];B[fp];W[bo];B[dq];W[cq];B[eq];W[cr];B[ek];W[ej];B[fj]C[B45 and B47 are strong moves! Old Cho's fighting spirit is still very high!];W[fk]
;B[el];W[gk]LB[fl:a]C[As to this, White's counterattack with W48 and W50 is inevitable, in this situation, B45 is still a little unreasonable, to play at 'a' is the original move.];B[co];W[cp];B[bn];W[ei];B[bp];W[bq];B[ao];W[en];B[fl];W[gl]
;B[gm];W[ep]C[W62 is a good move!];B[fo]LB[gq:a][fm:b]C[B63: Black has no other choice but to allow White make life, if Black plays at 'a', White can cut at 'b', Black is not good.];W[fq];B[gq];W[fr];B[gr];W[er];B[hm];W[nm]
;B[pm];W[hc]C[White gets to invade first with W72, and still takes the initiative of the game.];B[dc]C[Following B73, Black makes compromise by dodging himself, it is clever choice.];W[cc];B[cb];W[ec];B[db];W[ed];B[cd];W[bc];B[bd];W[bb]
;B[ba];W[eb];B[ac];W[gi]LB[mc:a]C[W86 is a slow move! It is a product under favorable consciousness. If White invades at 'a', Black is very difficult to handle.];B[id]C[B87 is the vital point for reduction! The situation suddenly becomes even.];W[ic];B[jd];W[hd];B[if]LB[pf:a][mc:b]C[B91: Black should play at 'a', preventing White from invading at 'b'.]
;W[mc]C[W92 is alert! Here White can't allow Black to form territory.];B[me];W[pc];B[qc];W[oc];B[qe];W[le];B[lf];W[kb]C[W98 and W100 is good sequence!];B[lb];W[lc];B[jb]
;W[kd];B[jc];W[kf]C[Through W106, White escapes safely.];B[mb];W[nc];B[pf];W[mf];B[lg];W[kg];B[je];W[ke];B[he]C[B115 is big! This is Black's compensation in exchange of the lost side territory, so far the situation is still even.]
;W[pk];B[ro];W[qg];B[pb]LB[qb:a][oe:b]C[B119 is a careless move! Black's purpose is to prevent White from playing hane at 'a' the double-hane to make a ko, but before this Black should probe White at 'b', if White still strongly destroys eyes, White will definitely incur loss in points, then Black strengthens with B119.];W[mp]C[W120: White certainly will not answer, Black misses a good chance.];B[kp];W[mq];B[kn];W[ff]C[W124 is a thick move and also big.];B[gf]
;W[fg];B[bf];W[bg];B[ce];W[df];B[ob]C[B131 is also thick and big.];W[dn];B[cm];W[bl];B[fn];W[nf]C[W136 introduces game-deciding play! Won SeongJin makes mistake.];B[oe]
;W[pg]LB[ng:a]C[W136 and W138 looks just fine, with W136 White should turn at 138, if Black plays at 137, White can make the diagonal at 'a', White can enclose a big territory in the center, this way the outcome of the game is still very hard to guess.];B[md];W[ld];B[of]C[But B137 and B141 are easily ignored "blind" points.];W[og];B[lh]C[After White blocks with W142, Black extends with B143, White unexpectedly can't resist!];W[mh]C[Following W144, White resists tenaciously, but White has so many defects, how White can capture Black?];B[kh];W[jh];B[mi]
;W[ki];B[li];W[ni];B[kj];W[ji];B[lk];W[ig];B[jj]C[Through B155, Black connects, White's potential in the center all disappears, White incurs a big loss. The situation already is White's big defeat.];W[ik];B[ij];W[gg];B[hk];W[hl]
