Translation:GoGameWorld.];B[qd]C[Watching Qiu Jun and Kong Jie play each other is very funny, they all sit tightly in front of the board as if they "lock horns like bulls", their two heads are very close as if you retreat one step you are going to lose the game! In this game, Qiu Jun perhaps was too tired because of the five game series in Mingren Title and was being chased and killed terribly by Kong Jie.];W[dd];B[pq];W[oc];B[dp]
;W[po];B[md]C[The one-space high pincer of B7 was once played by Qiu Jun, he should have studied it already.];W[ne];B[pf];W[me];B[qi]LB[kd:a]C[But B11 is not appropriate, Black still should jump to 'a', it is better.]
(;W[ld]LB[qc:a][rc:b][pd:c][qe:d][jd:e]C[Although W12 is clean and thick, but the sequence of W 'a', B 'b', W 'c', B 'd' and W 'e' is more efficient (see var a).];B[fc]LB[hc:a]C[B13 is unnecessary, after White's clamp at 'a', White instead is hard to take tenuki.];W[hc];B[oo]
(;W[pp]LB[on:a][qq:b][qp:c][qo:d][pn:e][qn:f]TR[qi]C[W16 is alert! If playing the hane at 'a' as joskei, the position of the marked black stone will be excellent, this is also the purpose of B15: If White attaches under at 'b', because of the support of the marked black stone, Black can play the hit at 16, then W 'c', B 'd', W 'e' and B 'f', initiating a fight strongly (see var a), White is no good. The play in the game is very crude but taking the corner in sente is playable.];B[op];W[qq]
(;B[oq]LB[qr:a][pr:b][rr:c][pn:d][qp:e][or:f]C[B19: Black should play the double-hane at 'a', followed by W 'b', B19, W 'c', B 'd', W 'e' and B 'f', this is clearly better than the real play, not clear why Qiu Jun doesn't play this way (see var a).];W[qr];B[pn];W[qn];B[qm];W[ro];B[cf]TR[fc]C[B25: Black takes tenuki regardless of the situation in the lower right, this is the reserved trouble of the marked black stone. Because you want to obtain sente, you naturally can't play freely.]
;W[df];B[cc];W[dc];B[dg];W[ce];B[ef];W[de];B[bf];W[eg];B[dh];W[eh];B[be];W[ei]C[As a result, in the situation where Black has outside thickness in the lower side, White instead sticks his head out with W38, Black undoubtedly has failed.]
;B[db];W[eb];B[cb];W[ec];B[rn];W[qo];B[pm];W[ff]C[W46 is thick, White's configuration at the top is very ideal.];B[ip];W[gq]C[Because White is thick at the top, White can invade bravely with W48.];B[iq];W[dq]C[The attachment of W50 is a good move! Black is painful.]
;B[eq]LB[ep:a][cq:b]C[B51 is impulsive! After White plays the twist-cut at 'a', because of the unfavorable ladder, Black sinks into a difficult situation, Black can only tolerate with the inner hane at 'b'.];W[ep];B[fp];W[eo];B[cq];W[dr];B[fq];W[cp];B[do];W[bq];B[co]
;W[cr];B[en];W[fo];B[gp];W[ho]C[W66 is a good tesuji!];B[go]C[B67: Because Black can't tolerate White's connection at 67, therefore Black pushes out angrily.];W[fn];B[gn];W[fm];B[gm];W[em];B[cj]
;W[cm]TR[gq]C[W74: However White has captured a huge corner, thinking of the earlier marked lonely white stone, it is hard to imagine! In the local fight, Kong Jie has played very beautifully!];B[ic]LB[fb:a]C[B75: Black has no choice but to release the game-deciding move of B75! However before this move, Black should first clamp at 'a', in the game after making himself heavy, Black has no time to play this anymore. Of course, a move at 'a' is damaging to points, White perhaps can't kill Black, but Black has to play this way.];W[id];B[jc];W[hd];B[lc];W[kd];B[mb];W[nb];B[bm]C[B83: Black first creates ko threats.]
;W[bl];B[hb];W[gb];B[ga]C[B85 and B87 are tenacious tactic! Why to give up easily!];W[kb]C[W88: White's calculation is accurate! Next Black has to play many local ko threats and Black is too painful to speak.];B[kc];W[ib];B[ia];W[ha];B[cl];W[dl];B[hb]

;B[jd];W[ha];B[dm];W[dn];B[hb];W[qe];B[ha];W[ea];B[ka];W[re]C[With the descent of W118, although Black makes life, however White has obtained two huge corners, Black can't keep balance in territory, Black's situation is very bad.];B[ja];W[kk];B[fd]
