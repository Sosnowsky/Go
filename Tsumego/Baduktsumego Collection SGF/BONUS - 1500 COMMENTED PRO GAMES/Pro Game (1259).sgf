Translation:GoGameWorld.];B[pd]C[In the league game 3 of the Korean 37th Wangwi title, a mere nobody and a young star Kim Juho 3p unexpectedly killed Cho Hunhyun's one big dragon and won the game quickly.];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[qo]
;W[jq];B[cf];W[fc];B[bd];W[cg];B[bg]LB[ip:a]C[The lower hane of B11 was seldom seen when the ladder is not favorable, but Black has the tactic of placing the ladder breaker at 'a', Black can fight.

;W[ci];B[ip];W[dh]LB[jp:a][io:b]C[W20: White elects to take one white stone immediately, but it seems slow, White should always attach at 'a', after Black extends to 'b', then White can take at 20.];B[iq];W[cc];B[de];W[ee];B[mc];W[oq];B[pp];W[jp]LB[jo:a]C[In the game, White attaches with W28, Black inevitably will hane at the head of two white stones with W 'a', White's shape looks cramped.]
;B[jo];W[pr];B[qr];W[ir];B[hr];W[jr];B[io];W[gq];B[hq];W[ko]LB[mq:a]C[W38 at 'a' is the proper move.];B[kn];W[lo]
;B[ln];W[no]LB[nr:a][mo:b]C[The jump of W42 seems inevitable, but this is exactly the reason why White sinks into a bitter battle, the strike of B 'a' is extremely severe! Cho 9p must have overlooked this move, otherwise White could extend to 'b' instead.];B[nr]LB[or:a][mp:b][mo:c][op:d][nq:e][np:f][mr:g]C[After B43, White already has no good answer, if White connects at 'a', then B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e' and B 'f', White can not live on the spot (see var a) ! if White presses at 'e', then B 'a', W 'g', Black is still left with the maneuver of the strike at 'b' (see var b). Perhaps Cho 9p thinks anyway there is no good move, maybe it's better to tenuki, however it seems he loses his senses, from here, Cho 9p's tune is all messed up.]
