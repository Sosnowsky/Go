;W[co];B[cn];W[cp];B[oq];W[qj];B[ql];W[qf];B[nd];W[lc]LB[rd:a][oj:b]C[The forcing move of W14 is rarely seen, it is a positive play, the common play is to make the knight's move at 'a' or jump to 'b'.];B[fc];W[hc]
;B[df]LB[rd:a][id:b][qh:c]C[Black approaches the corner with B15, then elects to play the joseki following B17, White clearly fails, W14 and 'a' all become excellent points, White opens up the situation very earlier on. With B15 Black can pincer at 'b' and also can consider to invade at 'c'.];W[fd];B[gd];W[gc];B[cd];W[ec];B[cc];W[ch];B[fb];W[eb]
;B[fe];W[ed];B[bf];W[rd];B[og]LB[ld:a][kd:b][kc:c][qh:d]C[The direction of B31 again is wrong, comparing with the top, the three-space extension on the right side seems weaker, Black should press at 'a', next W 'b' and B 'c', after Black settles shape, Black can take the chance to invade at 'd'.];W[ph];B[oh];W[pg]C[The counter-attachment of W34 is a good move!];B[rj]LB[of:a]C[B35: Although for Black to retreat at 'a' is painful, but it is still better than B35 which is not that meaningful.]
;W[of];B[nf];W[oe];B[ne];W[od];B[oc];W[pc];B[kc];W[nc];B[mc];W[ob];B[ld]C[Through B47, White obtains such a big territory in sente, White becomes favorable at one stroke.];W[dk]
;B[fk];W[el];B[en];W[fl];B[eq];W[er];B[dp];W[cq];B[fq];W[fr];B[gq];W[gk]LB[dn:a]C[White's sequence from W48 to W60 is clearly conservative plays in a favorable consciousness. With W48 White still should cut at 'a', which is just the right move.]
;B[gr]C[Black gets to turn with B61, the situation becomes closer.];W[mq];B[kq];W[kp];B[jp];W[oo]C[The sequence of W62, W64 and W66 is very clever.];B[np];W[jq]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.];B[kr]LB[iq:a][jr:b][lp:c][ko:d][lq:e]C[B69 is slow, at any rate Black should atari at 'a'! Next W 'b', B 'c', W 'd' and B 'e', this is the strongest answer locally. In the real game, W68 already becomes lighter.]
;W[ko];B[jo];W[jn];B[iq];W[mn];B[qi];W[qo];B[pp];W[po];B[pi]LB[pm:a][no:b][mp:c]C[The block of B69 is the last losing move. Now Black is already not favorable in the game, Black should make the diagonal extension at 'a', next W 'b' and B 'c', capturing W62, this way although the game is still slightly to White's advantage, but Black still can fight.]
;W[mp]C[White attaches back with W80, White obtains a lot of points and also becomes thick, Black ends up with only 8 points in the end, it is miserable to watch! Afterwards White proceeds safely.];B[no];W[nn];B[pm];W[ro];B[rp];W[om];B[nl];W[ol];B[nk];W[or];B[pr];W[nr]
