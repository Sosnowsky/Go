;W[co];B[cn]C[Black starts with Ni Ren Sei, this opening is not seen too often in Lee 9p's recent games. B7 tries to avoid "large avalanche joseki", possibly he don't want to make the game complicated.];W[cp];B[fc];W[cg]
(;B[dn]LB[cc:a]N[real game]C[B11 can also be considered at 'a' to take the corner, see variation.];W[fq];B[cj];W[db];B[ic];W[nc]C[W16 approaches the corner to take the initiative, it conforms to my style.];B[oc];W[nd];B[qf]LB[pf:a][kc:b][je:c]C[B19 is not good, it should jump to 'a', then White needs a two-space extension to 'b' and Black makes a knight's move at 'c', B19 at 'a' obviously exerts more pressure over White.]
;W[kc];B[je];W[dj]LB[pf:a][mf:b][id:c][le:d][ck:e]C[W22 attachment is the move I'm most proud of in this game. If Black retreats to 'e', White's crosscut will work, because the ladder does not favor Black. If B19 were at 'a', Black at 'b' can seal in White, White can't cross-cut at 'c', and can only play the knight's move at 'd'.];B[di]C[B23 must counter-attack.];W[ck]
(;B[dk]LB[ci:a]N[real game]C[if B25 connects at 'a', see variation.];W[ej];B[ci];W[dl];B[bk];W[ek];B[bl]C[The sequence from B25 to B31 connects two groups painfully, it seems Black has evaded White's attacks, however that's not the case.];W[id]C[W32 crosscut is very severe, from this point, I think, White takes the lead.];B[jd];W[jc]
;B[hc];W[ie];B[if];W[he];B[ed];W[de];B[jf];W[hf]LB[gf:a][eb:b][gh:c]C[But W42 is a bad move, it should diagonal at 'a' and does not give Black any other usage, then B 'b' and W 'c', this is cleary better for White.];B[hg];W[ff]
;B[gg];W[fe];B[eb]
(;W[ei]C[W48 is not good either, it should play as the variation.]N[real game];B[eh];W[dh];B[eg];W[dg];B[ld];W[lc];B[jb];W[kb];B[ia]LB[nf:a]C[B55 and 57 are questionable, because the group will live by a ko fight regardless of these two moves, it should cap at 'a'.];W[nf]
;B[nb];W[mb];B[ob]LB[gi:a][gj:b][hj:c][hk:d][ij:e]C[B59 and 61 are also hard to understand, Black loses sente when the center is so much urgent. This move certainly should jump to 'a', then W 'b', B 'c' W 'd' and B 'e', this way the game will be relatively smooth and slow.];W[hi];B[ih];W[bi]C[W62 gains some profit with sente, and seizes 64, the advantage is clear.];B[bj];W[bh]
;B[bn]C[B67 has no choice, it's unbearable if White hanes here in sente.];W[fn]C[W68 jumping again threatens Black's big group, the purpose is not to kill Black, but to form a thickness.];B[fo];W[go];B[gn]C[B69 and 71 are inevitable, if making life submissively, it's no better than resign directly.];W[gm];B[hn];W[eo];B[fm];W[fp];B[en];W[fo]
;B[gl];W[hm];B[hk];W[im];B[ij]C[Through B83, it looks like White is in danger.];W[fl];B[em];W[gj]C[But W84 and 86 turn danger into safety. If White tries to prevent White from connecting, see variation.]
(;B[el]N[real game];W[fk];B[bo]C[Black has to make life inside.];W[fg]C[W90 capures two black stones, and White is better off. In this local fight, Black basically didn't profit anything, but White not only gains a lot of territory and is also very thick on the whole board. The only chance for Black is to attack White on the upper side.];B[mg]C[B91 has to attack from here to reinforce himself.];W[ng];B[mh];W[pg];B[rh];W[kd];B[le]
;W[pf];B[pe];W[oe]C[White takes this opportunity to make life safely with 98 and 100 and not leave any chance for Black to make trouble.];B[bq]C[B101 is huge, it is worth more than 15 points as a counter-sente move.];W[qh]LB[ii:a][ji:b][jj:c][ki:d][jk:e]C[If I lose this game, W102 is the losing move. It should push at 'a', B 'b', W 'c', B 'd' and W 'e' capture three black stones in the center, Black then has no more chance. W102 aims to gain something in sente then play in the center.];B[qg]C[B103 is alert!];W[gb]LB[ri:a][ph:b][qi:c][pi:d][ka:e]C[In my mind, I plan to hane at 'a', but after B 'b', W 'c' and B 'd', earlier a sure sente move at 'e' may not be sente any more.]
;B[hb];W[ga];B[gc];W[cb];B[fb];W[ka]C[Because I am favored, I choose the sequence after 104, this helps Black to turn originally ko living group into complete living in order for me to take sente and play at 110.];B[ja];W[ri]C[Then I double hane.];B[qi];W[ph];B[rj]C[B113 and 115 are good moves.];W[rg]
;B[si];W[qe];B[rf];W[re];B[sg];W[qc];B[qb];W[pc];B[rc];W[od];B[pb];W[qd];B[kp]C[Although White gains a lot in the upper right corner, however Black seizes the last big point at 129, the situation becomes unclear.]
;W[km];B[jl];W[jm];B[iq];W[kj]LB[io:a][oq:b]C[W134 counter-attack is the only move, if simply taking two stones at 'a', Black will secure the corner at 'b', Black has an advantage.];B[ji];W[li];B[lk];W[mi];B[ki];W[lj]
;B[hh];W[gh];B[lh];W[mk]LB[io:a]C[W144 capturing at 'a' is better.];B[io];W[cr];B[ll];W[jk];B[ml];W[ik];B[hj];W[hl]
(;B[pq]C[Maybe because he is in byo-yomi time, Lee Changho made his last losing move, B153 should play as the variation.];W[ke];B[kf];W[lo];B[lp];W[mo]C[W156 and 158 simply reduce Black's territory, Black is quite difficult to give komi.];B[mp];W[on];B[dc];W[cc];B[ol];W[qn]
