;B[rc];W[pc];B[qg]C[Cho U again plays his favorite moves of approaching the corner directly and then attaching at 3-3, it forms the same opening as that in the game 1. Yu Bin has already studied this opening thoroughly while preparing for this final.];W[rb];B[qj];W[cf];B[cd];W[dj];B[cl];W[qo]LB[ef:a]C[W16: Normally White will jump at 'a', the play in the game is a little unreasonable.];B[dh]C[B17 is a strong move.]
;W[ef];B[gd]LB[bh:a]C[B19: Black can also jump down at 'a'.];W[ge]LB[eh:a]C[W20 is a surprising move, locally White usually will press at 'a', the play in the game is very crude!];B[hd];W[fd];B[fc];W[ed];B[ec];W[eh];B[dg]
;W[eg];B[di];W[ei];B[cj];W[ej];B[dk]C[No sure whether Cho U has studied this local variation, the play in the game is very crude. Through B33, Black's opening is not bad.];W[df]LB[bk:a][ci:b]C[W34: White can consider to first probe Black at 'a', after Black strengthens the cut at 'b',  then White can enter the corner at 3-3, keeping balance in territory. If White plays W34, it is better for White to extend at 33 with W32, taking some advantage!];B[dq]C[B35: Black is happy, protecting the big corner with just one move, White also dare not invade.];W[en];B[cn]
;W[jq];B[qm];W[dm];B[ek];W[fp]C[The tempo of W40 and W42 appears not coordinated.];B[fk]C[Through B43, Black's opening is successful.];W[jo]C[W44 is relatively impractical, after Black plays atari at the bottom, Black is simply favorable for the game, also Black is easier to take control in this situation. So far, we can't see White has any severe tactic!];B[pr];W[qq];B[kq];W[kp];B[lq]
;W[nq];B[jr];W[iq];B[np]LB[ir:a]C[B53: Black can consider to first crawl at 'a', this way Black can make life locally.];W[mr]C[After W54, Black is a little painful.];B[mq];W[nr];B[lo]C[Now the situation is still to Black's advantage.];W[kc];B[ir]C[B59 already can't achieve the effect of an asking move.]
;W[gq];B[rd];W[ci]C[B61 and W62 are miai good points, each side gets one.];B[bi];W[ch];B[bh];W[cg];B[hr];W[cm];B[bm];W[bn];B[bo];W[co]
;B[an];W[dn];B[cp];W[hn];B[fr];W[hb];B[gb]C[Now the game enters a close-game situation which Yu Bin is good at, overall Black is a little better. But how to settle the shape in the center is difficult for both sides.];W[hc];B[gc];W[of];B[ph];W[be];B[bd]
;W[qf];B[rf]C[After this move, it is time for lunch break.];W[pk];B[qk];W[oh]C[W90 is the only move, here is the vital point for influence expansion and reduction of both sides in the center.];B[oi];W[pg];B[qh];W[ni]C[White encloses territory at the maximum limit with W92 and W94.];B[nh];W[og];B[ld]LB[oj:a]C[B97 is a good move, if Black directly plays the weak move at 'a', it will be hard to say White is optimistic in the game.]
;W[lc]C[White has no other choice but to play W98, if attaching out, Black is relatively light and easier to handle.];B[oj];W[mi];B[je];W[rn]C[W102 is the biggest endgame.];B[fm];W[fn];B[mg]C[B105 is a feeling, in this period, Black sets the pattern very brilliantly, the game is still to Black's advantage.];W[md];B[li];W[lj];B[mh]
;W[ki];B[lh]C[B109 and B111 are very tight.];W[mk];B[kj];W[kk];B[jj];W[jk];B[ll];W[lk];B[nk]C[Black already successfully simplifies the game by settling down the shape beautifully.];W[rl];B[rm]
;W[ql];B[pm];W[pl];B[sl];W[nl];B[rk];W[om];B[op]LB[ml:a]C[B129: Normally Black will cut at 'a', then press the center, White obtains territory, the play in the game is not necessarily good for Black.];W[lr];B[kr];W[sn];B[sm]
;W[ln]C[W134: White perhaps has miscalculated, thinking he still can resist. Now White may consider whether the cut is good or not.];B[mn];W[mo];B[lp]LB[kn:a]C[B137 is a play in a favorable situation, to atari out at 'a' is relatively complicated, but it seems also playable.];W[mm];B[nn];W[kn]C[Although White gains a small profit, but Black is still a little favorable.];B[ji];W[bj];B[ck];W[bg]
;B[bk];W[ad];B[ac];W[ae];B[bb];W[gl]LB[ic:a]C[The early judgment is a little too optimistic, White obtained a considerable profit. Black clearly incurs loss when settling the shape in the center. Now the game is very close.

But with W150, for White to play at 'a' seems bigger.];B[sb];W[ra];B[jb];W[jc];B[ha];W[ic]
;B[ia];W[kb];B[gm]C[B159 makes White very painful.];W[hm];B[fl];W[on];B[no]
(;W[fq]LB[gr:a][go:b]C[B159 makes White to make compromise with W164. If White plays at 'a' with W164, then W164, Black blocks, and Black has the tactic of playing at 'b' (see var a) !];B[gr];W[lf];B[mj];W[oq]C[Black forgets to push at the bottom in sente, after White's counter-sente move of W168, Black clearly incurs loss, the loss is about 1 point.];B[nm];W[ml]C[Because of the mistake of W150, now the game is very close but still slightly to Black's advantage.];B[me];W[le];B[hq]
;W[hp];B[mf];W[kd]C[Yu Bin obviously enters into overtime, he is checking.];B[gf];W[gk];B[hj];W[ik];B[pj];W[ol];B[ko];W[jp];B[hh];W[kg]
;B[qn];W[rp];B[kh]LB[oe:a][ka:b]C[Now if Black first plays the sente move at 'a', after exchange, Black can play at 'b', Black will win.];W[ib];B[ja]C[After the atari, Black misses a chance.];W[ka];B[ga];W[jg];B[fe];W[ee]
;B[he];W[if]C[Since Black's endgame is not careful and precise, now Yu Bin is dangerous.];B[ie];W[qe]C[W200: White incurs a loss of 1/3 point.];B[re]LB[pe:a]C[B201 is a bad move, Black should play at 'a'!];W[pe];B[do];W[ne];B[aj];W[ah];B[ai]
;W[ag];B[gn];W[go];B[pp];W[eq];B[er];W[ks];B[js];W[ls];B[hk];W[hl]LB[oe:a]C[It is too regrettable that Black lost this game! B189 is the losing move, after playing at 'a', if Black plays at 192, Black will win the game.];B[nc]
