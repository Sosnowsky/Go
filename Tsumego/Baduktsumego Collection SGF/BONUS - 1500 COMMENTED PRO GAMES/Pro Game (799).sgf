;B[pf];W[qk];B[qi];W[qn];B[qo];W[pn];B[nq]C[Through B25, the opening is quite normal.];W[qc];B[rc];W[rd]C[White attaches and cuts with W26 and W28, this is also a common tactic.];B[re];W[pd]
;B[sd]LB[qe:a]C[B31: Black normally will connect at 'a'.];W[qe];B[qf]C[In the game, up to B33, it forms a ko fight, relatively complicated. It is obvious that Kong Jie thought that the normal set pattern is unacceptable.];W[rd];B[dd];W[cc];B[qd];W[eh];B[di];W[rd];B[pl]
;W[op];B[oq];W[qq];B[pq];W[ro];B[rp];W[rn];B[qp];W[pk]LB[qd:a]C[W50: White can also consider to eliminate the ko at 'a'.];B[qd];W[lc]LB[el:a]C[W52 seems slow, White should play at 'a' to continue the ko fight and doesn't need to back off.]
;B[pe];W[ol]LB[hd:a]C[W54 is a big slow move! This is the main cause of White's defeat in this game. Here White is unnecessary to strengthen. White should make the knight's move at 'a', the game would be still very early.];B[jc]C[The invasion of B55 is the last big point, Black starts to take the lead.];W[le]LB[hc:a][je:b][qb:c]C[White's jumping out with W56 is meaningless, White should make one-space extension at 'a', next B 'b' and W 'c'.
];B[hc];W[gd];B[ie];W[kc]LB[nd:a]C[White has to reinforce with W60, it is very painful! But if it is omitted, Black has the maneuver of striking at 'a'.]
;B[hf];W[iq];B[go]LB[dp:a][cq:b][fe:c][eb:d]C[The direction of B63 is wrong, Black should squeeze at 'a' to exchange for W 'b', then jump to 'c' and seal off White, Black can also consider to play at 'd', this way Black's victory is within reach.];W[gf]C[The attachment of W64 is huge!];B[gg];W[ff];B[hg];W[fg];B[bf]
;W[fj]C[Through W70, Black's potential in the center all disappears.];B[hj];W[gb];B[kq];W[bn];B[bm];W[bo];B[cl];W[hp]C[After the diagonal extension of W78, it becomes a close game, Black is slightly thicker.];B[ac];W[jb]C[With the sequence following W80, it leads to another ko fight, both sides don't have many ko threats.];B[ib]
;W[jd];B[id];W[ic];B[ed];W[fd];B[jc];W[dg];B[cg];W[ic];B[dp]C[Locally the ko threat of B91 is very damaging, however this could create many more ko threats, to ensure winning the ko fight is also very profitable.];W[ep];B[jc];W[dh]

;B[la];W[ne]C[Through W122, the local exchange comes to an end, the gain and loss for both sides are about equal, it is still a close game. ];B[jr];W[ir];B[rj];W[rk];B[ad];W[bb];B[fi];W[hl];B[ko];W[mn];B[lg]
;W[mp]C[W134 is an impulsive move, this is the biggest losing move of this game! White unexpectedly ends in gote.];B[mf];W[kg]LB[ob:a]C[The attachment of W136 is also a big crude move! White should simply block at 'a'.];B[kh];W[kf];B[je];W[lf];B[lh];W[ob];B[kd];W[ld]
;B[in]TR[hl]C[Black takes the vital point with B145, the marked black stone is very painful.];W[jl]C[With the sequence following W146, White manages to put up a desperate struggle, however even if White makes life, White's territory is already not enough.];B[km];W[ij];B[ma];W[oe];B[kl];W[kk];B[lk];W[kj];B[nm]
;W[oo];B[lj];W[hk];B[gj];W[gk];B[om];W[nl];B[mm];W[ml]LB[pm:a]C[W164: White can only play atari at 'a'. The play in the game is miscalculation or a way of conceding defeat.];B[pm]C[After Black connects with B165, White collapses.];W[qj]
