;B[do];W[dm]TR[dq]C[W6 appears with great frequency recently, W6 and the marked white stone must be well-prepared moves by Chang Hao while taking White against Cho Hunhyun.];B[fo];W[fq];B[cq];W[cr];B[cp];W[er]LB[br:a][ho:b][hq:c][ck:d][dj:e]C[W12 is rarely seen. W12 standing at 'a' is usual, then B 'b', White has to answer at 'c', next Black will immediately clamp at 'd'; W12 is resilient, if Black jumps to 'b', White can tenuki and extend back at 'e', comparing 12 with 'a', each has its pros and cons.]
;B[cm]LB[cl:a][dl:b][bm:c][cn:d][ck:e][el:f][dk:g][em:h]C[After some consideration, Cho Hunyun slides under with 13, the following variaion appeared before in pro games: W 'a', B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f' and W 'g' (see var a). After the hane of W 'a' and the cut of B 'b', for White to stand at 'h' or atari at 'd' is not to White's advantage.

(;W[dl]C[The retreat at W14 is seldom seen, but earlier this year Chang Hao used this move in Lebaishi final game 1 between him and Hu Yaoyu .
];B[cl];W[ck];B[dk]C[The cut of B17 is very intense, Cho Hunhyun's "Fast Gun" nature appears vividly on the board, he is never relentless in this kind of crucial places.];W[cn];B[bn];W[bk]

;B[ek];W[ej];B[fk];W[fj];B[gk];W[gj];B[hk]TR[bm]LB[dn:a]C[For the result up to 29, it becomes obvious that the marked black stone is better than the cut at 'a'.];W[cc];B[gd]C[White on the left is very thick, the reduction of B31 seems somewhat unreasonable, but this may be just the style of Cho Hunhyun.];W[id]C[The pincer of W32 with the backing of left thickness is certain.

;B[ci];W[cj];B[ee];W[ed]LB[df:a][ef:b][dg:c][hf:d]C[W36 aims to destroy Black's shape, if White directly jumps to 'a', then  B 'b', W 'c' and B 'd', Black can easily settle down.];B[gf]LB[fe:a]C[B37 is absolute, retreating to 'a' is cumbersome.];W[dg];B[eg]
;W[dh]LB[ig:a][ld:b][kc:c][je:d]C[After W40, the knight's move at 'a' is a good point, but White can make the extension at 'b' and is not bad; If Black exchanges B 'c' for W 'd', then makes the knight's move at 'a', Black's position is more ideal.];B[ig];W[nc]LB[qf:a][ld:b][kd:c][ne:d][pf:e][pb:f][qc:g][kb:h]C[Today Chang Hao plays very carefully and must think highly of this game. Black is pondering, the play of B 'a' and W 'b' is not Cho Hunhyun's style, if clamping at 'c', then the variation of W 'd', B 'e', W 'f', B 'g' and W 'h' can be foreseen.]
;B[ld];W[lc];B[kd]LB[kc:a]C[The retreat of B45 is surprising, but it is solid, the hane move at 'a' will lead to a complicated fight.];W[kc];B[md];W[mc];B[nd];W[oc]LB[od:a]C[W50 wedging at 'a' is more brutal, so far Chang Hao was still not involved in any direct confrontation with Cho Hunhyun.
];B[od];W[qj]LB[pc:a]C[W52 splitting the side is a good point, now crawling at 'a' is also a good point, obviously Chang Hao thinks 52 is bigger.]
;B[ql];W[qg]C[Through 54, White is leading in territory, Black is very thick across the board, perhaps both sides are very satisfied with this situation. So far it's time for lunch break.];B[ph]C[In the current situation, the key is how Black can make use of the center thickness, B55 forces White and also prepares to encircle the center territory.]
(;W[rf]LB[qh:a][pj:b][pi:c][oi:d][qi:e][pk:f][oh:g][ni:h][nq:i]C[W56 at 'a' in reply is usual, followed by B 'b', W'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f', W 'g' and B 'h' (see var a), leaving White a good approaching move at 'i', W 56 comparing with W 'a' is more territory-oriented.];B[nq]LB[oj:a][pi:b][pj:c][rh:d][pl:e][qi:f][ri:g][pk:h][ok:i][ol:j]C[After B57 secures the corner, White faces a challenge: being sealed in is out of the question; if White jumps to 'a', then B 'b', W 'c' and B 'd', White is simply separated; if White attaches at 'e', Black can play the crude move at 'f', W 'g' and B 'c'; if making the diagonal move at 'h', then B 'e', W 'i' and B 'j', White is no good either.]
;W[qk]C[W58 is an expedient measure.];B[pl]C[Black extends to the center with 59 and can also be satisfied.];W[qq]C[W60 probes Black.];B[pq];W[pp]LB[rp:a][jp:b]C[After W62, if Black stands at 'a', White is difficult to live, however, White leaves some aji in the lower right corner and can make the extension at 'b', so this may not be favorable to Black.];B[op]LB[rp:a][po:b][qr:c]C[B63 places emphasis on the center, White in the corner can live any time with the sequence of W 'a', B 'b' and W 'c'.]
;W[oj]LB[rj:a][rk:b][qi:c][ri:d][rh:e][qh:f][si:g][pi:h][pj:i][oi:j][pk:k]C[W64 reinforcing is necessary, because Black nearby is very thick, Black can excert measures against White on the right, for example, attaching under at 'a' is effective, followed by W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 'e', W 'f', B 'g', W 'h', B 'i', W 'j' and B 'k'.];B[ok];W[nj]LB[pj:a][pi:b][qh:c][pk:d][rh:e][qc:f][og:g]C[W66 sticking his head out to wrech Black's center thickness is very important, followed by Black's tesuji of wedging at 'a', W 'b', B 'c', W 'd' and B 'e', locally Black has some pretty gains, but if considering the center is destroyed and also White is left with the striking move at 'f' in the upper right corner, Black is not likely to be beneficial. It is worth noticing that the tactic of Black's doule-up at 'b' doesn't work, after W 'a' and B 'e', White can cap at 'g'.]
;B[nk];W[nh];B[hq];W[lj]C[W70 is a top-notch thick play, aiming at Black's connecting defect at the top.];B[kk];W[gp];B[ip]C[B71 and B73 makes a huge moyo.];W[jf]LB[jd:a][ic:b][ie:c][je:d]C[W74 is a good point for attacking, the manuever of B 'a' is not frightening, W 'b', B 'c' and W 'd' can cut.]

;W[rb]LB[pb:a][se:b]C[W84 is a good move, making a miai of 'a' and 'b'.];B[og];W[lf];B[rh];W[qh];B[rg];W[qf];B[sf];W[pb];B[rj]LB[rk:a][qi:b][pi:c][ri:d][of:e][pf:f]C[B93 is a brilliant move to shake off the trouble, if White blocks at 'a', then B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e' and B 'f', White's four stones are captured.]

(;W[qi];B[rk]C[Through 95, Black finally makes life.];W[rp]LB[qr:a]C[W96 is excellent timing,  because after Black becomes thick outside White then plays 96, Black could counter-atari at 'a' to kill White brutally.];B[po];W[of]LB[qr:a]TR[ig][if][gf][gd][ee][eg]C[As for just points, making life at 'a' is undoubtably bigger than 98, White's purpose is to strengthen himself then attack the marked black stones.]
