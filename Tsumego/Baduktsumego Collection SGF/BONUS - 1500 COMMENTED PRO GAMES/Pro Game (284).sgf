;W[od];B[cq];W[qc]C[W6 and W8 are Cho U's favorite play.];B[kd];W[ce]LB[dh:a][cf:b]C[W10: In theory, if W10 is being pincered by B 'a', White is not good, for White to make the large knight at 'b' is common.];B[dh];W[ic]LB[cj:a]TR[cp]C[The direction of W12 is not right, which leads to White's passivity. For White to invade at 'a' is also a little unreasonable, but at least W4 (the marked white stone) can be utilized, which is better than the real game.];B[de]
;W[kc]LB[ie:a]C[At any rate, W14 doesn't seem to be a good move, for White to jump to 'a' is better.];B[lc];W[ld];B[jc];W[kb];B[ke]C[B17 and B19 are common counter play to crosscut, simple and effective.];W[lb];B[mc];W[jd]LB[md:a][jb:b]C[W22: If White pushes at 'a', Black will push at 'b', White is also not good.]
;B[je];W[id];B[me]C[Through B25, it forms an exchange, Black net-captures one stone and succeeds.];W[cd]C[W26 is necessary, making Black not able to reinforce cleanly with one move.];B[cc];W[cg]LB[nc:a]C[But W28 is hasty, White should cross over at 'a'.];B[mb];W[qe]LB[dd:a][ch:b][hb:c]
;B[gc]LB[dd:a][ch:b][hb:c]C[B31: Black can consider to connect at 'a', next W 'b' and B 'c', this way White's big group at the top is not alive.];W[hb];B[pd];W[pc];B[pe];W[rd];B[pf]LB[re:a][qf:b][rc:c][of:d]C[B37 is the original move, if B 'a', then W 'b', B 'c' and W 'd', Black is not good.]

;B[da];W[fc];B[ha]TR[kc][kb][lb]C[B53 is clever! Black is still left with the tactic of capturing three marked stones, Black takes advantage.];W[ia];B[jb];W[gd];B[la]LB[bp:a]C[But the timing of B57 is early, the left side is still wide open, Black should play hane at 'a'.];W[bq];B[dq]
;W[cn]LB[br:a][ck:b][bo:c]C[W60: White perhaps thinks 'a' and 'b' are miai, and doesn't expect the clever tesuji of B 'c'! If knowing this early, White will hang at 'c'.];B[bo];W[bp];B[cl];W[cm];B[dl];W[br]C[B61 is beautiful tesuji, forcing the crude move of W64, Black takes a big advantage.];B[iq];W[ib]
;B[qn]LB[ja:a][ka:b]C[B69: Black perhaps feels the top is not that big, so takes tenuki. But now the situation is different, W 'a' is worth 11 points and also can be used for other purposes, this is the biggest move on the board! Black should capture three stones at 'b', this way Black is simply favorable for the game.];W[nq];B[qg];W[ja];B[on];W[rp];B[ro];W[kq];B[rq];W[qq]C[W78 should be reserved, this will help dodge at the top.]
;B[sp];W[qi];B[rg];W[oi];B[ob];W[oc];B[nf];W[pk]C[At this crucial moment when the situation just becomes about even, with W86 White makes miscalculation in the corner! And this happens to Cho U who is very good at life-and-death problems, unbelievable!];B[rb]C[B87 is good move!];W[nc];B[md];W[nb]
;B[na];W[pb]LB[rc:a][pa:b]C[W92: White can't answer at 'a', otherwise, after B 'b', White is ko-living as a whole.];B[rc];W[oa];B[qf];W[qb];B[rf]C[In the game, Black cuts off the tail and obtains a big profit, Black again takes the lead.];W[ra]LB[se:a]C[W98: White messes up the situation, even if Black captures three stones at 'a', White is also not good.];B[qa]C[B99: In the game, fighting a ko is Black's momentum.]
;W[qp];B[ql];W[qk];B[rr];W[sb];B[sa];W[pm]LB[gq:a]C[The ko-threat of W106 is too soft, White should make chaos at 'a'.];B[sc];W[pn];B[rl];W[pl];B[qo]
;W[po];B[ma];W[gq];B[gp];W[hq];B[hp];W[ir];B[ip];W[jq];B[ko]LB[em:a]C[B121 is not simple and clear enough, Black should connect all together at 'a', White has no chance.];W[em];B[hm]
;W[el];B[ek];W[fk];B[ej];W[fq];B[fp];W[fj];B[bl];W[ei];B[di];W[fn];B[kl]LB[km:a]C[B135 is not the right place to reinforce, Black should play at 'a'.]
;W[bh];B[bi];W[bg];B[fi];W[bj];B[cj];W[gi];B[fh];W[jn]C[W144 is severe!];B[jr];W[kr];B[hr];W[js]
;B[in];W[jo];B[jm];W[kn]C[White separates one stone and gains big profit.];B[hk];W[hj];B[gm]C[The situation again becomes close, but the board is smaller, Black's small victory can't be altered.];W[qr];B[rs];W[gh];B[fg];W[ik]LB[fm:a]C[W160: White fights desperately, the original move is to connect at 'a'.]
;B[il];W[jk];B[fl]C[The cut of B163 is severe, Black's thickness in the center is put into use, White sinks into a big bitter battle.];W[gk];B[gl];W[hl];B[eq];W[gr];B[hk];W[sn];B[so];W[hl];B[fr]
