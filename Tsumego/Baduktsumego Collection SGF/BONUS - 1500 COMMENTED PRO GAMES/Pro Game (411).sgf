;W[ci];B[cn];W[cl];B[gc];W[ed];B[jd]C[The sequence from B1 to B11 is Gu Li's favorite opening.];W[cd];B[qk]C[It is a big and difficult problem where is the best place to play B13.];W[lc]LB[oc:a][od:b]C[W14 is a variation, in the past for White to play at 'a' or 'b' is more common, it seems Park Jungsang is well prepared as to this.];B[nc]
;W[le];B[kc];W[lb];B[ne]C[The tempo of B17 and B19 is very good.];W[kd]C[W20 is an asking move.];B[ke]LB[jc:a]C[Black elects to stick the head out fast to the center, but after the atari of B21, Black itself becomes thin in the corner. Therefore, Black still may want to connect at 'a'.];W[ld];B[je];W[lf];B[jg];W[lh]
;B[mg]LB[lg:a]C[Black peeps with B27, White certainly doesn't want to connect at 'b'.];W[kf];B[jf];W[kh];B[ii];W[ni]C[B31 and W32 are miai good points, each side gets one.];B[fe]LB[ge:a]C[The knight of B33 can't be omitted, here if White gets to cap at 'a', Black's big group will sink into an unstable situation.];W[pc]C[W34: White enters into Black's corner, which is the leftover problem after the atari of B21.];B[qc]
;W[oc];B[ee]LB[ph:a]C[B37 and W 'a' are miai, each gets one.];W[ph]C[In the opening, the situation is about even, it is time for lunch break.];B[pg]LB[pf:a][qn:b]TR[oc][pc]C[B39: If Black makes the knight's move at 'a' instead, it is kind of sente to W34 and W36 two stones, so now to reinforce back at 'b' is urgent.];W[qh];B[qg]C[B39 and B41 are questionable.]
;W[oe];B[pe]LB[oh:a]C[B43: Black should hane at 'a' to obtain sente.];W[po]C[White gets to invade first with W44, White is successful in the opening, White is favorable for the whole game.];B[oh];W[pj];B[qj];W[pi];B[ol];W[qq]LB[qm:a]C[W50: White should make the knight at 'a' instead, which is the urgent point for both sides!]
;B[qm];W[qn];B[qr]C[B51 and B53 are alert!];W[qp];B[mq];W[fq]C[However, after the small knight of W56, the situation is still to White's advantage.];B[cp]TR[cn]C[Following B57, Black must move the marked black stone.];W[cq];B[do];W[bp];B[ep]
;W[co];B[dq];W[cp];B[eq];W[eo];B[fp];W[dn]C[Through W68, White is thick on the board, White is closer to the champion.];B[or]LB[hp:a]C[B69: Black should defend at 'a' to play slowly.];W[rr];B[rs];W[rm]
;B[rl];W[pm];B[pl];W[ql]LB[be:a]C[W76 taking the ko is questionable, allowing B 'a' become ko threat, White should hane at 'a' instead, Black can't initiate the ko.];B[be]C[The descent of B77 can't be missed.];W[bd];B[qm];W[hq];B[hp]LB[gq:a][fo:b]C[As to W80, following B81, White is too smooth! With B81 Black can only play atari at 'a', next W81 and B 'b'.]
;W[ip];B[ho];W[gq];B[fo];W[lq]C[The attachment of W86 is a good move.];B[om]LB[mp:a]C[B87 initiating the ko is too hasty, for Black to simple retreat at 'a' is better, see how White to strengthen and take chance to start the ko.];W[ql];B[lp]C[In order to start the ko, B89 to exchange with W 'a' is a big damaging move.]LB[kq:a];W[kq]

;W[nd]C[After eliminating the ko, through W104, White is favorable.];B[io];W[pk];B[rh];W[ri]C[W106 and W108 are illusion.];B[ok]C[White surprisingly overlooks B109. However, the situation is still to White's favor.];W[jp];B[dk];W[ck];B[di];W[dh];B[ch]C[As to the game-deciding moves of B113 and B115, ...]
;W[dj];B[ei];W[ej];B[fi];W[fj]LB[jo:a]C[..., W116, W118 and W120 are good judgement, since after these three moves, the turn at 'a' becomes ko threat, Black is already in a difficult situation.];B[gj]C[Black's sequence following B121 is tenacious.];W[gk];B[hj];W[cg]C[Following W124, White's calculation is accurate, it forms a ko.];B[bh];W[bg]
