Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[On 5/9, Yun Junsang 6p defeated Han Sang Hoon 1p in the challenger final of 41st Korean Wangwi and obtains the right to challenge title holder Lee Changho 9p in best-of-5 series.];W[dc]C[Although Han Sang Hoon is just 1p, but his strength can't be underestimated, recently he just advanced to the main event of LG Cup. However, in this game he didn't give a play to his talent, perhaps he was a little nervous since this was his first time to have a chance to obtain the right and become a challenger.];B[pp];W[dq];B[ce]
;W[oc];B[do];W[dl]LB[ci:a]C[In the configuration of B5 and B7, the tight pincer of W8 is a little unreasonable, White can consider to slowly attack at 'a'.];B[gp]LB[fo:a][cj:b]C[B9: Black's joseki selection is not good, Black needs to use the supporting troop of B5. Therefore, Black should jump to 'a', then counter-pincer at 'b'.];W[eo]C[B5 is being attacked, Black is not good.];B[en];W[fo];B[dp];W[fq]

;W[fm]C[However, this new play is not necessarily good, please use it carefully.];B[gn];W[ho];B[gm];W[fl];B[gl];W[fk];B[gk];W[gj];B[hj];W[fj];B[ik];W[ci]LB[qe:a]C[Due to the existence of W52, the value of W52 becomes bigger, otherwise for White to block at 'a' is the absolute move.]
;B[qe];W[pf];B[qg];W[jd];B[hc]LB[bc:a]C[The direction of B57 is wrong, which is the reason why Black falls behind in the opening. For Black to play at 'a' is the only move.];W[ed];B[fc];W[jc];B[he];W[fd];B[gd];W[ff]C[From W58 to W64, White wants to capture B5 at a big scale with great momentum.]
;B[jf]LB[if:a][bj:b][bc:c]C[Although now it is not time to make life B5, but B65 in the game is too loose. For Black to play at 'a', 'b' or 'c' is all better than the real game.];W[hg]C[W66 is vital point, Black's shape is not right, painful.];B[hi]LB[je:a][ld:b][cb:c]C[At any rate, B67 is not right move. Black should play at 'a', White perhaps will reinforce at 'b', then B 'c', to fight for victory.];W[ie]C[White separates Black with the diagonal of W68.];B[gg];W[gh]
;B[db];W[cb];B[eb]C[In the process of making life, Black sacrifices B5 with B71 and B73, Black's loss is huge!];W[cc];B[fe];W[ee];B[hf];W[am];B[al];W[dr];B[ao];W[aq];B[bs]
;W[ep];B[am];W[if];B[fg];W[ef];B[gf]C[The most critical is, Black ends in gote.];W[bj];B[dj];W[cj];B[ap];W[kq]C[W94 is huge move.];B[ig]
;W[hh];B[ih];W[gi];B[ib];W[lc];B[eg];W[dg];B[df];W[cg];B[ca];W[ba];B[da]C[From B95 to B107, Black ends in gote, but in terms of points and thickness, Black gains, their value is not small.];W[qn]C[However, White destroys Black's potential on the right side with W108.]
;B[qo];W[pn]C[For the whole game, White is simply favorable.];B[nq];W[qk];B[pc];W[ob];B[rn];W[rm];B[ro];W[jg];B[pg];W[kg];B[ok]
;W[rh];B[od];W[ne];B[oe];W[of];B[rg]C[B125 and B127: Black apparently already has no mind to continue fight.];W[pd];B[om]C[Black wants to kill White here, but it is impossible.];W[pi];B[pj]C[In the game, Black just tries to find a way to concede the game.];W[qj];B[oi]
