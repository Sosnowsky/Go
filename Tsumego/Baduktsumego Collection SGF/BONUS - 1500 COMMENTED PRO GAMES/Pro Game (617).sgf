Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[Perhaps the enticement of US $400 thousands champion prize is too huge, in the crucial second game, Song TaeKon lost common senses and released bad moves after bad ones, sinking into a losing position very earlier in the game. On the other hand, Chang Hao was calm and his play was thick and steady, he did give a full play to his talent, and for the entire game he didn't give any chance to his opponent.];W[dd];B[fc];W[hc];B[pp]
;W[oc]C[The opening of not taking the empty corner immediately is very popular in Korea recently, W6 is just one example.];B[cp];W[qh];B[pe];W[qk];B[nd]LB[cc:a][qb:b]C[B11 is an important order, if Black plays at 'a' first, White will make the knight's move at 'b', next if B11, White will push and cut, Black is no good.];W[mc];B[cc];W[dc];B[cd]
;W[de];B[db];W[eb];B[cb];W[ec];B[cf];W[fq];B[dq];W[nq]C[The conception of W22 and W24 is not successful, simply approaching at 24 is better. The exchange of W22 and B23 makes White himself heavy and and it is damaging.];B[jq]C[The counterattack of B25 is inevitable.];W[pn]LB[qn:a]C[If W26 at 'a', Black's attachment at 26 worries White, White's configuration on the right side is repetitive.]
;B[on];W[qq]LB[om:a][oo:b][no:c]C[W28 directly entering the corner is the reason why White falls behind in the opening stage of the game! White should first hane at 'a', when Black retreats at 'b', then White can play at 28, this way Black couldn't make the excellent shape at 'c' as in the real game.];B[pq];W[qp]LB[po:a]C[W30: White should also bump at 'a', although Black turns down at 30 and it will form an exchange, White is not good either, but it is better than the real game.];B[po];W[qo];B[pm];W[qn]
;B[no];W[fo];B[dm];W[hq];B[jo];W[lq]LB[kp:a][jr:b]C[W38 and W40 fighting with each other from left to right are certainly not good, in the study room we even questioned that the game record may be wrong, later we saw it was really played this way, all people immediately felt that Chang Hao would win the game, because Chang Hao is very good at taking control of such a thick situation. With W38, White either jumps to 'a' on the right side, or  with W40 White can directly play at 'b' on the left side and make life, no matter what the situation is, you have to play this way.];B[kp];W[jr];B[ir];W[mo];B[mn]
;W[or];B[pr];W[lo];B[ln];W[kn];B[ko];W[kr];B[iq];W[mr]LB[fm:a][qm:b]C[In the game, White wants everything, through W54, although White lives in sente, but White on both sides incurs a big damage, not only Black's outside becomes extremely thick and also the most fatal part is, next  'a' and 'b' become super-vital points, Black defintely will get one, after this variation, White is already in a losing trend!];B[km];W[do]
;B[co];W[om];B[fm];W[hr];B[is];W[nm];B[lp];W[mp];B[np];W[mq];B[nn];W[eq];B[dr]C[B69: Black gives White's big group a way of making life, Black is already very polite, but if White simply lives, it is just another way of defeat.]
;W[eg];B[pl];W[ql];B[gp];W[in];B[hp];W[gn];B[jn];W[gl];B[id]C[B79: Black seeks intervolving attack.];W[md]LB[hd:a]C[The direction of W80 is wrong again, White should attach at 'a' to ensure his safety on the right side.]
;B[hd];W[ic];B[gc];W[jc]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.];B[df];W[ef];B[fe]C[After B83 and B87, White added another lonely group, White is in an extremely bitter battle.];W[ce];B[be];W[bf];B[bg];W[cg]
;B[af];W[dg];B[jd];W[kc];B[fb];W[hg];B[gm]C[The push and cut of B99 is severe!];W[hm];B[hl];W[il];B[hk];W[ik];B[hj]
;W[ij];B[hi];W[ci]LB[ii:a][hh:b]C[In terms of shape, with W108, White certainly should press at 'a', but Black will bump at 'b', White's big dragon on the left will have no way to live.];B[ii]C[In the game, Black turns at 109, White's shape collapses, it is too miserable to watch!];W[kj];B[ji];W[kk];B[jg];W[el];B[em]
;W[bh];B[ck];W[bj];B[bk];W[ei];B[dj];W[di];B[nl];W[nk];B[ok];W[mk];B[ol];W[kf]
;B[pc];W[jf];B[ea];W[ob];B[pb];W[re];B[rd];W[fk];B[ig];W[if];B[gg]C[Black simply encloses territory by attacking, White already suffers a big defeat. Song TaeKon didn't play well in this game.];W[gh];B[ej]C[The game 3 will take place on 9/10.]
