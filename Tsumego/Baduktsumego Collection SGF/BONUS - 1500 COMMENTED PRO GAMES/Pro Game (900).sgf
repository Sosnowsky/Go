;B[jp]C[B5 and B7 are rarely seen and it is Wang Xi's favorite.];W[qn];B[qp];W[qk];B[qi];W[on];B[pm];W[pn];B[mp];W[ok]C[Because B13 is damaging, White can be satisfied by reinforcing with W16, if B13 is omitted, W16 is unnecessary.];B[fc];W[cf]
;B[pj]LB[qf:a][pf:b]C[Black thinks White may approach at 'a', so Black plays B19 first, planning to press at 'b' to sacrifice.];W[pk];B[db];W[cc];B[ic];W[qf];B[pf];W[qc]C[White enters the corner with W26 to wage a tit-for-tat and destroy Black's plan.];B[qe];W[oc]
;B[cn]LB[ck:a]C[B29: For Black to split at 'a' is common.];W[cl]LB[fp:a]C[The counter-pincer of W30 is tight, if Black seals with the knight's move, White will crosscut at 'a', although White is not favorable in the ladder, but White can play ladder breaker in the upper right corner.];B[en];W[fp]C[After White attaches out with W32, the play of B29 is damaging.];B[gq];W[ep];B[gn];W[ho];B[ek]
;W[dj];B[ej];W[di];B[bo]C[From B37 to B41, Wang Xi's thinking is unique and hard to understand.];W[fm];B[bl];W[dm]LB[dl:a][bm:b][fn:c]C[W44 is crude, to play at 'a' is better, next 'b' and 'c' become miai.];B[dn];W[em]
;B[fn];W[gp];B[iq];W[bk];B[cm];W[dl];B[bq];W[bp];B[ap];W[jo];B[cr]LB[ko:a]C[B57: Black worries too much, Black should play hane at 'a'.];W[hq]
;B[hr];W[hp]C[W58 and W60 are clever moves!];B[kp]C[The aji of B61 is bad, leaving Xie He (White) a chance to show brilliant moves.];W[ir];B[gr];W[dr];B[ko];W[jr];B[kr];W[bm];B[gm];W[jn]
;B[im]LB[hk:a][kn:b]C[B71: Black should play at 'a', better to stay far away from White's thickness at 'b'.];W[kn];B[mc]C[B73 is the last big point and its value is huge.];W[pc];B[rd];W[rc];B[nb];W[ob];B[rf];W[mo]C[W80 is the vital point for the shape! Black is not comfortable.]
;B[ln];W[lo];B[lp];W[no];B[kl];W[lm];B[bn];W[al];B[hj];W[np];B[nq]LB[mr:a]C[B91 is clearly miscalculation! Black can only play at 'a'.];W[lr]
;B[ks];W[oq]LB[rq:a]C[W92 and W94 are in excellent order! Black's territory has been dramatically reduced and later on White is still left with the tactic at 'a', Black incurs a big loss.];B[mq];W[jq];B[kq];W[ip];B[is];W[id];B[hd];W[jc];B[jd];W[ie]
;B[je];W[hc];B[ib];W[he]LB[jf:a][rq:b]C[Now White's advantage is very clear, but W108 is an overplay! White can simply play hane at 'a' to settle the shape in sente, then play at 'b', White will happily win the game.];B[gd];W[kc];B[hb];W[ld];B[md];W[jf];B[ke]

;B[ka];W[nf]C[After a chaotic fight, White still has to reinforce the cut with W130 in gote, White's loss is not small, the situation is not clear.];B[fg];W[ph];B[qh];W[hi]C[The attachment of W134 is Xie He's first-rated tactic to tangle, although White takes a huge risk, but in terms of result, it is the winning move! Now both sides have no way to back down, this fierce fight will decide the champion!];B[dg];W[ef];B[df];W[de];B[ff];W[cg]
;B[dh];W[ch];B[ki];W[gj];B[in];W[io];B[ei]C[B143 and B147 are all strongest answer. In close-contact battles, who retreats one tiny step will incur a heavy loss.];W[ij];B[hk];W[kj];B[ji];W[ik];B[jj]
;W[hl];B[gl]LB[hg:a]C[Perhaps Xie He is lucky, B155 is a fatal mistake! If Black plays at 'a', White is very dangerous and Black can fight adequately.];W[jk]C[W156 is alert.];B[kk];W[lj];B[jl];W[jg];B[kh];W[hg]C[W162 is a good move! The following sequence is one-way street, instantly Black collapses.];B[hf];W[gf]
