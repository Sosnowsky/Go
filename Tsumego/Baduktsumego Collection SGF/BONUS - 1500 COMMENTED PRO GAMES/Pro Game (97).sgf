(;SZ[19]EV[7th Samsung Cup semi-final game 2]PC[Korea]DT[2002-11-13]KM[6.5]C[Copyright gogameworld.com and weiqi.tom.com.]PB[Wang Yuhui]BR[7p]PW[Cho Hunhyun]WR[9p]RE[W+3.5];B[qd]C[Black is Wang Yuhui 7P of China.];W[dd]C[White is Cho Hunhyun 9P of Korea. ];B[pq];W[oc]C[W4 first approaching the corner is a positive play.]
;B[ld];W[po];B[pc];W[qq];B[qk]LB[qr:a][qp:b][or:c]C[B9 hane at 'a' is common, followed by W 'b' and B 'c', then W9 extension is ideal for White, so B9 in the game tries to hold back Black's plan.];W[pr];B[dp]LB[oq:a][or:b][qp:c][pp:d][nq:e][rq:f]C[B11 can also consider to first draw back to 'a', after the normal variation W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 'e' and W 'f', then Black takes the lower left corner.]
;W[oq]C[W12 capturing one stone is very thick, but White spends three moves here, Black can not be dissatisfied.];B[ph];W[fc];B[iq]C[Through 15, it appears Black's opening is faster.];W[cn];B[fq];W[ck]LB[bp:a][cm:b]C[If W18 knights at 'a' as usual, White fears Black will attach at 'b'.];B[id]LB[od:a]C[B19 can also hane at 'a'.]
;W[mc]C[The sequence following 20 starts making sabaki (light play).];B[lc];W[pb];B[qb];W[nb];B[od];W[nd];B[oe];W[lb];B[kb];W[qa];B[ra];W[pa]
;B[rc];W[md];B[la];W[mb]LB[kc:a]C[Through 36, White makes life, but Black still has the weak point at 'a'.];B[co];W[dn];B[be]LB[le:a][ce:b]C[If B39 reinforces in the vicinity of 'a', then White's diagonal move at 'b' is extremely big.];W[bd];B[cj]C[B41 is questionable.]
;W[bj];B[cd];W[cc];B[ce];W[bc];B[ci];W[bi];B[ch];W[dk]C[Through 50, it seems White's tempo is smoother.];B[ef];W[kq]C[Through 52, from the standpoint of territory, White is no longer lagging behind.];B[ed]
;W[fd];B[dc];W[db];B[bn];W[bm];B[bo]C[The hane and connection of B57 and B59 are big moves to secure the corner, and also aim to attack White later.];W[bh]LB[bl:a]C[If W60 tenukis, after B60, Black can clamp at 'a', which White cannot tolerate.];B[de];W[ec];B[qm]LB[ge:a]C[B63 should knight seal in White at 'a' to strengthen.]
;W[oj];B[pk]LB[pi:a][pl:b]C[The reason why B65 is not played at 'a' is that Black does not like to be peeped by White at 'b', but the play in the real game seems clumsy.];W[oh];B[og];W[pi];B[qi];W[ng];B[pg]C[Through 71, White can be satisfied.];W[gf]C[W72 starts twisting attack.];B[ei]
;W[jd]LB[kc:a][kd:b][jc:c][jb:d]C[W74 is a tesuji for attack, if cutting at 'a', then after B 'b' and W 'c', B 'd' can sacrifice by wrapping tactics, this does not favor White.];B[le]LB[jc:a]C[If B75 hangs at 'a', White will take 75.];W[jc];B[je];W[ie]C[After W78 cuts, Black is hard to answer.];B[kc];W[ke]
;B[jf];W[kf];B[if];W[kd];B[kg];W[lf];B[he];W[gh]C[W88 is unexpectedly strong and tough.];B[bl];W[cl]LB[am:a]C[W90 is a thick play, the descent to 'a' can capture one black stone, but on the outside Black has many uses for other purpose.];B[am]
;W[cm];B[ge]C[It is inevitable for B93 to push through and cut, resulting in a fight.];W[fe];B[ff];W[gg];B[gi];W[ih];B[hi];W[ig];B[jg];W[ji];B[mf];W[lg]
;B[lh];W[mg];B[ki];W[jj];B[lk];W[eh];B[dh];W[eg];B[hk];W[fi]LB[fj:a][ej:b][fh:c][fg:d][df:e][cg:f][ee:g]C[W114 is severe, if Black plays at 'a', followed by W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 114, W 'e', B 'f' and W 'g', two black key stones are captured.]
;B[fj]C[B115 seems to fall into a trap.];W[df];B[cf];W[ej];B[fh];W[fg];B[dg];W[fi];B[bg];W[di]C[Through 124, White has gained an overwhelming advantage.];B[me];W[ic]
;B[ee];W[kj];B[lj];W[mi];B[li];W[go]LB[gq:a][gr:b][fr:c]C[W132 aims at the tactic of W 'a', B 'b' and W 'c', but it looks slow.];B[jl]C[Now Black has 20 points in the lower left, 30 points in the upper right, 5 points on the left, the total for Black is 55 points; White has 20 points in the lower right, 5 points in the center to the left, 4 points in the upper right, 10 points in the upper left, plus komi, total points for White is 45.5 points, Black is very thin in the center, the game is hard for Black.];W[kk];B[kl]
;W[ll]C[The thrust and cut of W134 and W136 are very severe, consequently creating two black weak groups.];B[ml];W[lm];B[nk]LB[cb:a]C[After 139, Black can cut at 'a' to set up a ko fight, but now it is still premature.];W[jn]C[W140 jump attacks, White in the center is very thick, Black is difficult to handle.];B[hn];W[im];B[il];W[hm];B[kn];W[hl]
;B[km];W[ik];B[cb]C[W149 is an one-sided ko, Black has little to lose, due to ample ko threats for Black in the center, Black still have chance to win.];W[dd];B[jo];W[io];B[dc];W[eb];B[jp];W[gq];B[gn];W[fp];B[in]

;W[lp]C[W172 is a good move, it aims to connect at 'a'.]LB[jm:a];B[mo];W[bb];B[ro]C[B175 is very big, Black seizes this move and proves successful in the fight. Now on the board, White has about 50 points, Black acquires about 60 points, Black is better off.];W[ir];B[lo]LB[hr:a][hq:b][jr:c][ip:d][jq:e][jm:f][eo:g][fo:h][en:i][ep:j][do:k][ko:l]C[If B177 prevents White's connection at 'a', White will play at 'b', then B 'c', W 'd', B 'e', W 'f', B 'g', W 'h', B 'i', W 'j', B 'k' and W 'l', Black is worse off.]
;W[jq];B[ip];W[hq];B[pp]C[The sequence after 181 is worth study.];W[qp];B[op];W[nq];B[ob]C[Wang Yuhui is entering into overtime.];W[oa];B[mp]C[B187 is the losing move.];W[np];B[oo]
;W[no];B[on];W[nn];B[mm]LB[qo:a][om:b][pn:c][nl:d][ho:e]C[If B193 cuts at 'a', after W 'b', B 'c' and W 193, 'd' and 'e' are miai, Black is not good.];W[qo];B[mq];W[qn];B[pm]
