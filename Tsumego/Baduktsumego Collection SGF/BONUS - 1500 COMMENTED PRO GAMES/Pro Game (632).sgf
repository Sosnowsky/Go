;B[pf]LB[nf:a][og:b][me:c][hd:d]C[B19: Black normally will hane at 'a', next W 'b' and B 'c', this way White can enclose territory at top by playing at 'd', Black can't be satisfied. Therefore Black varies in the game with the wedge of B19, the purpose is to obtain sente and play at the top.];W[pg];B[pe];W[og];B[md];W[mc];B[jd];W[kd];B[jc]
;W[je];B[hd];W[ie];B[fd]LB[fc:a]C[B31 is a thoughtful move, I once wanted to make the knight's move at 'a', but I'm worried that White will press Black at 31, Black is painful.];W[cd]LB[fc:a]C[W32 is slow, White should hane at 'a'.];B[fc];W[be];B[ke]C[The cut of B35 is severe.];W[le]
;B[kf];W[jb];B[ib];W[kb];B[ig];W[hg]C[Although W42 and W44 are in good order, ...];B[hh];W[jg];B[jh];W[kg];B[kh];W[lg];B[hf]C[... but Black is able to expand the lower side by sacrifice with the sequence from B43 and B49, I think Black is successful in the opening.]
;W[dj];B[cj]LB[dl:a][cg:b]C[When White makes the shoulder-hit of W50, I once thought attacking with the knight's move at 'a', next W51 and B 'b'. However the play in the game is also fine.];W[dn];B[dl];W[do];B[dp];W[bo]LB[cn:a][bm:b]C[With W56, Yu Bin played very quickly, but he may ignore Black's good moves at 'a' and 'b'.];B[cn]
;W[cm];B[bm];W[dm]LB[bn:a][cp:b][bl:c]C[White has no other choice but to play W60, if White ataris at 'a', then B 'b', W 'c' and Black cuts at 60, White on the left has a life-and-death problem.];B[bl];W[ep];B[eq];W[fp];B[fq];W[gp];B[hr]
;W[el];B[cl];W[fn]C[Through W70, Black is successful in the fight.];B[rp]C[B71: Black invades White's right side.];W[qp];B[ro];W[rq];B[rr];W[qq];B[ql];W[re];B[rd]
;W[rm]C[W80 is severe!
];B[qn];W[rl];B[qm];W[lp];B[kp];W[mq];B[lo];W[mp];B[nm];W[kq]C[By attacking Black, White obtains a considerable profit with the sequence following W90, the situation has been slowly turned around.

;B[gl];W[fl];B[gn]C[The attack with B105 and B107 is no good.];W[gk];B[gm];W[fj];B[hk];W[hj];B[ij];W[go]LB[mj:a]C[W114 is of favorable consciousness, with this move, White can reduce Black's potential of making territory by playing at 'a', this way White is favorable in the game.

;W[gj];B[sq];W[qr];B[mi]C[After B119, Black tries strongly to enclose territory in the center, Black has to play this way in order to have a chance to win.];W[mn];B[jq];W[kr];B[ln];W[ko];B[kn];W[jp];B[jn];W[hl]
;B[ik];W[im]C[The aji in Black's territory is very bad.];B[il];W[hn]LB[nj:a][ni:b][qo:c][rn:d][mm:e]C[W132: The last chance for White is W 'a', B 'b', W 'c', B 'd' and W 'e', because of Black on the right side, Black can't push and separate White, Black's center potential would be gone. This way White will win the game.];B[oi]LB[mm:a]C[But White ignores Black's good move of B131, after W132, Black take tenuki to reinforce with B133, Black is alert!
