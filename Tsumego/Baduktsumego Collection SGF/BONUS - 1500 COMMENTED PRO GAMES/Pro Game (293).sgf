Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[pd]C[In the decisive game 3 of Chunlan Cup, Zhou Heyang guessed White as he wished. Originally in the first half of the game, his situation was not bad, but with his double hane of W82 and knight's move of W140, he twice missed a good chance, it is a pity.];W[dd];B[qp];W[dq];B[op]

;B[jc]C[The opening of the first 19 moves is same as that of the recent game in Nong Shim Cup between Lee Changho and Wang Xi, most players think Black is favorable, it seems this opening is still worth study.];W[mq]C[W20 forcing in sente is White's privilege.];B[nr]LB[pn:a][pm:b][rp:c]C[Before the knight's move of B21, Black can consider to first exchange B 'a' and W 'b', this can prevent White from attaching at 'a' later on.];W[pc];B[qc];W[oc];B[qb];W[ne]LB[od:a][pe:b][lc:c]C[W26: For White to turn at 'a' is better, next B 'b' and W 'c'.]
;B[mc]C[The sequence following B27 are good moves.];W[pe];B[od];W[nd];B[oe];W[of];B[qd];W[nc];B[nf];W[lc];B[fc];W[cf];B[mf]
;W[le];B[kg]C[Through B41, Black's territory on the right side is not small, White clearly incurs loss.];W[je];B[kd]LB[lb:a][mb:b][kb:c][ld:d]C[The diagonal of B43 is unnecessary, Black should play hane at 'a', if White ataris at 'b', Black can retreat at 'c', White can't tolerate Black's wedge and atari at 'd' next, but there is no good way to strengthen, White is very painful.]
(;W[lf]LB[ld:a][ke:b][jb:c][ib:d][kf:e][lg:f][mg:g][kb:h]C[W44: For White to simply connect at 'a' is just fine. If Black pushes at 'b', White can attach at 'c' first, it is a good move, next B 'd', W44, B 'e', W 'f', B 'g' and W 'h', Black is tasteless (see var a).];B[ld];W[lg];B[me]LB[kb:a][ng:b][mb:c]C[B45 and B47: Black overlooks White's diagonal at 'a'. Otherwise, with B45 Black should block at 46, or with B47 Black will simply turn at 'b', next W47 and B 'c', these two results are all better than the real game.]
;W[md];B[ng];W[kb];B[mb];W[jb];B[nb]LB[ic:a]C[B53: Black still should calmly extend at 'a'.];W[ic]C[In the game, White hanes with W54, Black suffers a big loss.];B[db];W[cc];B[ed];W[gb]LB[jd:a][ff:b]C[W58: White should first atari at 'a', even if Black still takes tenuki, White would be still fine, reserving the exchange of W58 and B 'b' is to White's advantage. Perhaps in the game Heyang didn't expect Black will take tenuki, this is the strong place of Lee Changho, he comes back in time.]

;W[dg];B[cb]C[B83 and B85 are good moves! White has no answer.];W[bb];B[ba];W[bc];B[eh];W[fi];B[cg];W[dh];B[bf];W[be];B[bg];W[di]
;B[ad];W[ch];B[ae];W[ab];B[bh];W[bi];B[af];W[ah];B[ca];W[ai];B[fb]C[Through B107, White incurs a loss of about 15 points in territory. The situation has been turned around.];W[fo];B[eo]
;W[en];B[eq];W[dn];B[pb]LB[gq:a]C[B113: For Black to jump out at 'a' is a little bigger, but from state of mind Black wants to capture at 113.
];W[gq];B[mr];W[kq];B[iq]C[Black invades with B117 to probe White, Black is alert.];W[er];B[fr];W[gr]
;B[dr];W[ir];B[jl]C[B123: Black plays in the middle to test White, if White has no assurance in capturing Black, White's territory will be inadequate, White is very difficult.];W[ll]LB[rp:a][rq:b][ge:c][fe:d][gd:e]C[But White directly confronts with W124, which just fits Black's plan, with W124, White should first attach at 'a' to probe Black, if Black retreats at 'b', then White can strike at 'c', next B 'd' and W 'e', see whether Black can still make life safely. If Black retreats everywhere, White can consider to enclose the center.];B[jn];W[ln];B[kk];W[mj]
;B[li];W[mi];B[hh]LB[lh:a][mh:b][lj:c]C[The extension of B131 seems heavy, Black should directly bump at 'a', next W 'b' and B 'c', White basically can't kill Black.];W[ji]C[W132 is the vital point.];B[go];W[fn];B[hi];W[rp];B[rq]
;W[qo];B[pp];W[ik]LB[ij:a]C[But the knight's move of W140 is the losing move! After Black makes the diagonal back at 'a', White's territory is clearly inadequate. With W140 White should make the diagonal at 'a' to separate Black, this way the situation will be still very complicated.];B[ij];W[hk];B[jj];W[lj];B[kj];W[im];B[jm];W[in];B[io]
