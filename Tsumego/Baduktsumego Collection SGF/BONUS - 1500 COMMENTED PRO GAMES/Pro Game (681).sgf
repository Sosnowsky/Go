(;SZ[19]EV[Korea 7th LG Refined Oil Cup final game 1]DT[2002-10-04]PC[Korea]KM[6.5]PB[Lee Sedol]BR[3p]PW[Choi MyungHoon]WR[8p]RE[B+R]C[Commentary by Liu Jing 8p, Copyright by gogameworld.com and weiqi.tom.com.];B[pd]C[In game 1 of best of five games, "invincible youth" Lee Sedol builds his thickness meticulously since the opening and prepares to kill Choi MyungHoon 8p's big dragon. Later in the game his killing mode grew wild, and across the whole board he's chasing to kill one white's group after another, in the end he accomplishes the massacre, the miserable situation was rarely seen in the recent go world. Lee Sedol's style is too bloody, in his dictionary the word "compromise" does not exist.];W[dd];B[pq];W[dq]
;B[qo];W[kq];B[do];W[cm];B[en];W[fp];B[cq];W[cr];B[cp];W[hp]C[W14 is a trend, hard to judge whether it is a good or bad move.];B[dl];W[ck];B[dj]LB[cl:a]C[B17 stresses on outward influence, a push at 'a' is the joseki.]
;W[cj];B[di];W[ci];B[dh];W[cg]C[Through 22, both sides have some gains.];B[go];W[gp];B[pj];W[nc];B[lc];W[qf];B[nd];W[qi]LB[md:a][mc:b][qj:c][qd:d][qc:e][od:f]C[W30 is questionable, it should first hanes at 'a', if B 'b' cuts, White turns back to play at W30, then B 'c' and W 'd' slides under. Although this way W30 incurs some loss, but Black can not hane at 'e' to fight, otherwise White has the tactic of wedging at 'f', then it leads to a normal joseki, as a result, White is still acceptable.]
;B[qe]C[B31 is strong!];W[pf];B[qj];W[md];B[ne]C[After W34 hanes, B35 extension is severe! White has been cut into two pieces, the fight does not favor White, and White is very dissatisfied.];W[mc];B[oc];W[ng];B[me];W[ld];B[le];W[kd]
;B[pi]C[B43 is the key for eye shape and can not be omitted.];W[ph];B[qh];W[lg];B[ke];W[jd];B[li];W[jg];B[je];W[ie];B[if];W[he];B[oh]
;W[qc]C[W56 simple seizes another big corner, and put all bets on the life and death of the middle dragon.];B[re];W[ob];B[pb];W[pc];B[od];W[qb];B[hf];W[gf];B[ge];W[gd];B[fe];W[fd]
;B[gg];W[ff]C[The sequence after W70 is a miscalculation, it is better if White tenukis here and plays around tengen.];B[ee];W[ef];B[nb];W[pa];B[de];W[df];B[ce];W[ed];B[cd];W[cc];B[bc]
;W[jf];B[hg]C[The exchange of W82 for B83 is hard to understand, the aji to cut at 83 disappears.];W[cb];B[bg]LB[bf:a][cf:b][bd:c][ch:d]TR[ci][cj][ck][cm]C[B85 is excellent! if White plays at 'a', B 'b' can cut, then W 'c' and B 'd' pushs through, and all four marked stones get killed! this seems a miscalculation.];W[bh];B[be]

The center dragon needs to make life, and the big group on the left side is also not completely alive, at this time White unexpectedly throws a big gote move. It's unimaginable, and may only expains to that Yun Seong-hyeon is overconfident on living his big dragon! W100 should make a knight move at 'a', Black's four marked stones are home free by a diagonal move, then White extends out to 'b', though this variation is very painful, but the game is still up in the air.]

;B[gl];W[km];B[bl]C[After Black makes some preparations, it suddenly delivers a killing move -- B129! the real intention is revealed in the end! White can only resist with an unreasonable ko, but in the center Black has abundant ko threats, the game for White is as good as lost.];W[cl];B[bm];W[bn];B[bo];W[cn];B[an];W[co];B[bq];W[am];B[al]
