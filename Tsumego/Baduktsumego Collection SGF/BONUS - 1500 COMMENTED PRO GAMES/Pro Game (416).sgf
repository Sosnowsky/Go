;W[oq];B[cq];W[qf];B[nc];W[cr];B[cp];W[er];B[ck];W[qm];B[po];W[pj]C[White first approaches at W8, next counter-pincers with W14,  then gets to play 16, forming an ideal shape and handling the problem at the bottom to Black.];B[np]C[The knight pressing move of B17 is almost inevitable.]
;W[nq];B[lp]LB[mp:a][mq:b][kq:c]TR[qm][pj]C[If B19 was played as the joseki to extend at 'a', White will crawl at 'b', followed by B19 and White's jump at 'c'. Although this way Black is more thick, but the two marked white stones are already there waiting for Black, Black's thickness is futile, White can be satisfied.];W[mp];B[mo]C[B19 to B21 are strong moves, Cho 9p has already seen through White's purpose, so he fights directly with White by utilizing the drawback of White's lacking one more move in the lower left corner.];W[mq];B[lq];W[lo]LB[pp:a][oo:b][qq:c][ro:d][rq:e][pn:f]C[The cut of W24 is in disorder. White should first squeeze at 'a' to probe Black. If Black draws back at 'b', White can hane at 'c', followed by B 'd' and W 'e'. Even if White does not cut with 24, White already gains by occuping the big corner; If Black enters into the corner at 'c' like in the game, White can hane at 'b', B 'f', White then cut at 24, Black has no other alternatives this way.]
;B[mn]LB[no:a][qr:b][rr:c][ko:d][lr:e][jq:f][jr:g][ir:h][iq:i]C[B25 has missed a golden opportunity. Generally speaking, the extension of 25 is the correct shape, but now it's a bad move. Black should directly connect at 'a', followed by W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 'e', W 'f', B 'g', W 'h' and B 'i', White has no follow-up moves.];W[pp];B[qq];W[oo];B[pn]
;W[ko];B[jq];W[jp];B[kr];W[lr]C[W32 and W34 are tesujis.];B[kq]C[Black can only connect with 35 clumsily.];W[on];B[pm];W[om];B[pl];W[hq]C[W40 again is a tesuji.];B[hr]
;W[gr];B[ip];W[io];B[hp]LB[mr:a][js:b][jr:c][os:d][ms:e][qs:f]C[Afterwards, Black can only sacrifice two stones with 43 and 45, then live at 'a' with a grievance, however White still has a good sequence of W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 'e' and W 'f' to expropriate Black's corner.];W[iq];B[ir];W[gq]
;B[mr];W[ol];B[ml]LB[lm:a]C[B51 is too unreasonable!  White on either side is alive, Black has no thickness nearby, and still put his two lone stones into motion, it is a way to ask for trouble!];W[lm];B[mm];W[ok];B[ql];W[rk];B[rl]C[B57 is slow, it should tenuki.];W[lk]C[W58 is ferocious and ruthless! Black falls into a bitter battle instantly.];B[ln]LB[nj:a][mk:b][nk:c][nl:d][ll:e][kl:f][kk:g]C[If B59 switches to the knight's move at 'a', Black may barely escape, if followed by White's push and cut at 'b', Black's block at 'c', W 'd', B 'e', W 'f', Black's cut at 'g'. Though the ensuing variation is very complicated, but there is a chance of ko fight for Black.]
;W[jl]C[After Black's push at 59 and White's good capping move at 60, Black's big dragon is on the verge of death.];B[mk];W[mj];B[kl]LB[jm:a][im:b][il:c][jn:d][jo:e][in:f]C[B61 and B63 are out of sequence. B61 should first attach at 'a' right away, if White hanes at 'b', Black then can double hane with 63; If White draws back at 'c' like in the game, Black has a good tactic of setting up a bait by the peep of B 'd', followed by W 'e' and B 'f'.  Even the situation is still not favourable for Black, but it is always better than dying as a whole.];W[kk];B[jm];W[il]C[White has played flawlessly from W66 to W98, Black's key stones in the center get killed.]
