;W[dp];B[kc];W[qk];B[qn];W[qh];B[qf];W[oh];B[db];W[cc];B[hd];W[fq];B[kq]LB[ng:a]C[B17: For Black to split the left side is relatively common, Black can make the shoulder-hit at 'a', expanding his moyo at the top, this is also a powerful conception.
]
;W[pc];B[qc];W[mc]C[The invasion of W18 and W20 is appropriate, seeking fight positively.];B[me]LB[pi:a][qi:b][og:c]C[B21: Black can first strike at 'a' to ask White, if White blocks at 'b', Black can borrow strength by attaching at 'c', Black is not necessary to attack directly as playing the cap of B21.];W[qb];B[rb];W[kb]C[The attachment of W24 is a common tactic to dodge.];B[jb]LB[lb:a][lc:b][kd:c][le:d][jc:e]C[B25: Black definitely can't play hane outside at 'a', because White can cut at 'b', B25, after W 'c', White can hang at 'd' to form a good shape. But in the game the inner hane of B25 is also not good, Black should retreat calmly at 'e', this way White at the top is not easy to form a good shape.]
;W[lb]LB[jc:a][pb:b]C[After White retreats with W26, White's cut at 'a' and connection at 'b' become miai good points, White succeeds in the first fight.];B[pi];W[qi];B[ob]C[The invasion of B29 is inevitable.];W[jc]C[The cut of W30 is also inevitable.];B[jd]LB[ib:a][kd:b][je:c]C[B31: Black first plays atari then crawls at 'a', this is the strongest move locally. If Black simply retreats at 'a', after W 'b', then B31, White can counter-atari at 'c' to stick the head out.]
;W[ic];B[ib];W[hc];B[hb];W[gc];B[gb];W[gd];B[kd];W[pb]C[From W32 to W38, White takes the chance to run out, first White presses Black to the second line in the upper left corner, then White connects with W40 in the upper right corner, not tangling with Black again. So far, the game enters into Lee Sedol's handy situation.];B[oc];W[pd];B[nd];W[pf]
;B[pg];W[qe];B[re];W[pe];B[qg];W[le]LB[ld:a]C[W50: White dives into Black's crack, and thus opens up White's door to victory, this is Lee Sedol's strong point. In terms of result, with B39 for Black to hang at 'a' is a little better.];B[lf];W[ld];B[ke];W[rf];B[rg];W[rd]
;B[sf];W[rc];B[ph];W[nb];B[na];W[kf];B[mf];W[fd]C[After White cuts with W62 then turns with W64, the situation completely enters into White's tempo.];B[jf]C[B65: Black can only strengthen himself, otherwise if White extends here, Black's four key stones will be captured.];W[ec];B[fb];W[eb]C[W66 and W68: White obtains profit.]
;B[ea]LB[ma:a][fa:b]C[B69: Black can only cross over, if Black extends at 'a', although Black can capture White cleanly, but White can hane at 'b' in sente, Black's territory will be inadequate.];W[kg];B[jg];W[kh];B[jh];W[ki];B[ji];W[kj];B[ok]LB[lc:a]C[B77 is the last losing move, now Black can only reinforce at 'a'.]
;W[ma];B[oa];W[nc];B[od];W[lc]C[After White makes life deadly stones with W78, W80 and W82, the game for Black is as good as lost.];B[ka];W[ja];B[ia];W[ga];B[fa];W[cb];B[og];W[jj]
;B[hi];W[ij];B[gh]C[Black is extremely painful to play dame moves like B89, B91 and B93.];W[id];B[je];W[gk];B[ja];W[dc];B[la];W[da];B[mb];W[qo];B[md]
;W[rn];B[po];W[qp];B[pp];W[pn];B[qm];W[rm]C[Although this is a fast game, but Lee Sedol's sharp style leaves us deep impression.])
