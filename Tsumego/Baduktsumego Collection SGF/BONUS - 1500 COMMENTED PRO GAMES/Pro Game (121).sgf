Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[Gu Li and Choi Cheolhan are all most talented and fight-oriented young players among Chinese and Korean, every time they meet, the game will be brilliant to watch, this time it also doesn't disappoint us.];W[dc];B[dp];W[pp];B[ce]
;W[ed];B[ci];W[oc];B[jc];W[hc];B[mc];W[qi];B[pc];W[od]C[The play of W12 and W14 is clever, it is novel and also very provocative.];B[qf]C[B15: Black fights back angrily, in this kind of place, Choi Cheolhan never makes compromise.];W[og];B[ph]
;W[pg]C[White pushes down with W18, both sides have no way to back down.];B[qh];W[qg];B[rg];W[rf];B[rh];W[qe];B[re];W[pf];B[sf];W[lc]LB[kc:a]C[W28 creating ko threats is necessary, but its play is a little inappropriate, to attach at 'a' seems more powerful.]
;B[md];W[mb];B[nb];W[lb];B[ob];W[ld];B[me];W[rd];B[qf];W[qc]C[W36 and W38 are very fancy tesujis, but the result is not satisfactory.];B[pe];W[pd];B[qe]
;W[pb];B[nc];W[oe];B[nf];W[of];B[mh]C[Black gets to seal off with the knight's move of B47, White has been put to great inconvenience.];W[oh];B[oi];W[sd];B[pi];W[se]LB[le:a]C[The order of W52 is again wrong, White should first press at 'a' to exchange with Black's hane, then White can make life.]
;B[rf];W[rb];B[je];W[jb];B[le]C[After Black turns with B57, Black becomes very thick, in this fight Black scores.];W[qn];B[jp];W[ej]LB[cn:a]C[The feeling of W60 is excellent, to approach at 'a' is rather common, Gu Li is not satisfied with this kind of easy and tasteless play.];B[ei]C[B61: Black strikes back bravely, Black's fighting spirit is quite high.];W[di];B[dh]LB[dj:a][cj:b]C[But next the play of B63 is not fierce and relentless enough, Black should cut at 'a', next W63 and B 'b', this way Black can fight.]
;W[dj];B[cj];W[eh];B[fi];W[ch];B[dg];W[ck];B[bk];W[cl];B[bl];W[bh];B[bi];W[fj]LB[cm:a][el:b][co:c][fk:d]C[W76 is inexplicable! Now White should extend at 'a', if Black turns at 76, White can jump to 'b', next the jump at 'c' and hanging at 'd' become miai, White must get one, White's shape is smooth and fluid.]
;B[cm]C[Black's shape instead is lucid with the hane of B77.];W[gi]LB[df:a][cf:b][fg:c][eg:d]C[W78 is a crude move, White should bump at 'a', if Black blocks at 'b', White can make the diagonal at 'c', Black is no good, because Black can only turn and capture at 'd', White can push down at 'b' and White also gains some profit.];B[fh];W[eg];B[ef];W[ai];B[bj];W[fg];B[gh]
;W[df];B[cg];W[cf];B[bg];W[bf];B[ah];W[ff];B[gj];W[hi];B[hj]C[B93 and B95 are minister. Although White gains some territory in the upper left corner, but White's outside is in tatters and White's loss outweighs his gain.];W[dq];B[eq];W[ep]C[White cuts and dodges himself with W96 and W98.]
;B[fq];W[fp];B[gp];W[gq];B[dr];W[cq];B[cp];W[dm];B[dl];W[do]C[W106 and W108 are tight, Gu Li starts to show his talent.];B[bq]C[B109: Black has no other choice.];W[dk]
;B[el];W[bm];B[cn];W[co];B[cr];W[fk];B[ij];W[bn]C[Through W118, White captures two stones, the situation becomes closer.];B[fn]C[Black chases and attacks with B119.];W[gl]LB[hl:a]C[W120 is heavy, White should make the small knight's move at 'a', this way it is not easy to come under attack.];B[fl]
;W[gk];B[hm];W[gm];B[gn];W[il];B[hh]C[In the game, Black first captures two stones with B127.];W[fm];B[en];W[dn];B[em];W[in];B[hn];W[ik]
;B[jn]C[Then Black protects the lower side with B135, White's territory is already inadequate.];W[kk];B[ki];W[kn];B[jm];W[im];B[io];W[km];B[ll];W[kl];B[ko];W[mn];B[mo]
;W[no];B[mp];W[np];B[nn]LB[nq:a]C[With B147, B149 and B151, Black doesn't let White go easily and continues to tangle, Choi Cheolhan is deserved to be called a brave fighter. In fact Black only needs to simply hane at 'a', Black is already very difficult to lose this game!];W[mm];B[on];W[mq];B[nq];W[oq];B[nr];W[lq];B[lp]
;W[po];B[ol];W[nk];B[ok];W[kq]C[White first makes one eye with W162 then extends inside with W164, it is a fierce game-deciding play!];B[jq];W[jr];B[cm]C[B167 throwing in a ko is the last game-deciding move.];W[hp];B[go];W[bp];B[ap]
;W[ao];B[bo];W[kj];B[jj]LB[ji:a][mj:b][or:c][fd:d]C[In the overtime and under the time pressure, B175 is the losing move! Now Black should calmly retreat at 'a', although White has many local ko threats, but Black has more than 10 ko threats at 'b', 'c', 'd', etc., this way White is fraught with grim possibilities.];W[bp];B[aq];W[li]C[W178 is alert and also the winning move of this game! Now no matter how Black to answer, White will have plentiful ko threats.];B[mj];W[kh]

;B[pm];W[ro];B[rl];W[sn];B[rk];W[bo]C[White eliminates the ko with W238 and surprisingly makes life with 10 points of territory, needless to say, Black incurs loss.];B[js];W[ge];B[kp];W[sl];B[qj];W[af];B[ib]

The best-of-3 semi final between Gu Li and Lee Sedol will take place on 11/16-11/19.])
