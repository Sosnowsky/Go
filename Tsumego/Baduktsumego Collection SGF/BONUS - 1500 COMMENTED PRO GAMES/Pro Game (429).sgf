;W[ed];B[oc];W[do];B[co];W[cn];B[cp];W[dn];B[ch]LB[fq:a]C[The two-space extension of B13 is a territory-oriented move, normally Black will jump to 'a', White will force at 13.];W[eq];B[er];W[dp];B[cq]
;W[fq];B[fr];W[hq]C[Through the jump of W20, White has nothing to complain.];B[qn];W[np];B[pj];W[cj]LB[jc:a][gq:b][gr:c][dk:d]C[The play of W24 is relatively initiative, after the game, Hu Yaoyu said White can consider to make the extension at 'a', but he worries that Black will wedge at 'b' and connect at 'c' in sente, then make a high extension at 'd', this way all White's developing potential on the lower side almost disappears.];B[gq];W[gp]
;B[gr];W[hp];B[dj]LB[di:a][ic:b][fp:c][ep:d][ci:e][ej:f][dk:g][ck:h][ek:i][ei:j][cl:k]C[B29 is indeed an overplay! Perhaps Cho Chikun originally didn't think Hu will play the intense counterattack maneuver by cutting with the hane at 'a'! Black sinks into passivity immediately. The original move for Black is to make the extension at 'b', another possible move is to play the atari at  'c' first, after W 'd', then Black can press at 29; If White still plays at 'a', then after B 'e', W 'f', B 'g', W 'h', B 'i' and W 'j', Black can play the hane at 'k', after White plays the counter-hane, Black can play the double hane, White will be killed by one liberty in the capturing race! In the game, there is no this exchange, this tactic is no longer working. I think Cho Chikun probably overlooked this.]
;W[di];B[ci];W[ej];B[dk];W[ck];B[ek];W[ei]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.];B[fp];W[fk];B[ep];W[el]C[W40: After White contains Black's three stones, White starts to take the lead.];B[bc]
;W[kc]LB[kd:a]C[W42: For White to make the high extension at 'a' is relatively simple and clear.];B[je];W[ic];B[ld]C[After Black takes advantage in sente with B43, Black seals off White with B45.];W[kd]C[W46: White must push and cut, now they are entering into another round of fight.];B[ke];W[le];B[lc];W[lf];B[kg];W[lg]
;B[kh];W[lh];B[lb]LB[ki:a][mj:b]C[However, in this crucial moment, Black releases the fatal slow move of B55! At any rate, Black should extend at 'a', White can only make the knight's move at b', Black then descends at 55, this makes a big difference from the real game.];W[ki];B[id]LB[jd:a]C[Perhaps when Cho Chikun makes the diagonal's extension of B57, he never thought of White's good move at 'a'.];W[jd]TR[kc][kd]C[W58 looks like a typical crude move in the textbook, but now this move already safely connects back the two key marked stones. What's more important is that White already grabs the highest point with the hane of W56, White's advantage is clear.];B[kb]
;W[jc];B[hd];W[hc];B[ig];W[gc];B[ji];W[kj];B[jj];W[jk];B[hj];W[ik];B[gf];W[ph]LB[on:a]C[When White invades with W72, Black originally should jump to 'a', but now Black is unfavorable in the game and can only aim at White's weakness.]
;B[nj];W[qe];B[pe];W[pf];B[qf];W[re];B[rf];W[rd];B[pd];W[qg];B[of];W[pg]LB[rj:a]C[With the sequence from W74 to W84, White strengthens himself in sente, then plays the reduction move at 'a', it can be said that it is an easy and clear way to ensure victory.]
;B[rc];W[rj];B[rg];W[rh];B[nh];W[mi];B[sd];W[ok]C[W92 is a relentless move! In the critical time, Hu Yaoyu is not softhearted.];B[qk]C[Black can only make life painfully with the sequence following B93.];W[oj];B[rp];W[qq]
;B[rk];W[oi];B[on];W[pm];B[pn];W[nn];B[rq];W[om]C[White conceals Black with W102 and W104 and has enclosed a territory of about 50 points in the center, White already has established his victory.];B[oq]C[Cho Chikun made several big mistakes, such as B29 and B55, thus he becomes very passive, perhaps this is the reason why he incurs such a terrible defeat.];W[op]C[In the second round, 6 Chinese have advanced to the next round, but because the third round will start in Sept. next year, so it is still too early to say that we can win to the end.];B[qr];W[pr]
