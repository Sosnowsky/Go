];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[fc]
;W[cf];B[kc];W[qk];B[qm]C[The opening with B5, B7 and B9 are one of very popular openings, Gu Li often uses it in his games.];W[qh];B[qf];W[oh];B[pi];W[ph];B[rj]LB[ol:a]C[B13 and B15: Black immediately moves out, with B13, to play the knight's move at 'a' or take tenuki is common.];W[oc]C[W16: White doesn't first set the shape on the right side but approach the corner instead, the thinking is nimble.]
;B[od]C[Because being restricted by White's reserving all kinds of variations, Black can only press out at 17, this way White exchanges three moves, White's shape is resilient.];W[nd];B[oe];W[mc];B[pc];W[rk];B[ri];W[pj];B[rh];W[qo]LB[oi:a]C[W26: Next White takes tenuki again to set the shape on the right side, the common play for White is to atari at 'a'.];B[oi]
;W[ic]C[B27 and W28: Both Black and White play on their own, White's attitude is still not confronting with Black directly.];B[ni];W[rm];B[ld];W[ec];B[fd];W[ie];B[fg];W[lf];B[kf]LB[me:a][ne:b]C[The attachment of B37 seems a little far-fetched, but by making the diagonal extension at 'a' or turning at 'b' Black still can't capture White cleanly.]
;W[pb];B[qb];W[gf];B[ff]LB[kg:a]C[B41: Black can consider to extend at 'a', White would attach at 41 to form an exchange.];W[ke];B[le];W[kd];B[lc];W[mf];B[ne];W[kg];B[jf]
;W[ig]TR[gf]C[In the game, due to the addition of the marked white stone, White can capture the two black stones with W50.];B[df];W[ce];B[cg];W[bg];B[ch];W[bh];B[ci];W[ng]C[Especially the diagonal extension of W58 is sente.];B[nh];W[og]
;B[qi]C[Black can only connect at 61, it can be easily seen that Black's opening fails. ];W[jc];B[fq];W[cn];B[qp];W[ro];B[np];W[eq];B[fp];W[jq];B[ql]C[The sequence following B71 seems a little vulgar, however Black is not favorable in the game, Black can only fight like this.];W[rl]
;B[om];W[rq];B[qn];W[rn];B[rp];W[sp];B[qr];W[po];B[nn];W[rr];B[jo]LB[io:a]C[B83 is an overplay! Black should make the knight's move at 'a'.];W[hp]C[The counterattack of W84 is severe.]
;B[ho];W[go];B[ip];W[hq];B[iq];W[ir];B[jr];W[gr];B[is];W[hr];B[kq]C[Through B95, Black incurs loss again.];W[op]LB[rs:a]C[The diagonal of W96 is to prevent Black from creating a ko by playing at 'a'.]
;B[fr]LB[oq:a][hn:b][gn:c]C[B97: Black takes tenuki to block at the second line, this is correct, if Black block at 'a', White already avoids ko in sente, then plays atari at 'b' and connects at 'c', Black perhaps would have no chance to turn the game around.];W[hn];B[io]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.];W[er];B[es];W[fo];B[ep];W[do];B[gp]
;W[kr]LB[jp:a]C[W106 exchanging with B 'a' is a very bad move!];B[jp];W[gs];B[dq];W[dr];B[cr];W[cq];B[ds];W[dq];B[fs];W[br];B[gq]
;W[nq]TR[kr]LB[oq:a]C[Xie He has played very beautifully before this move, but due to the addition of W106 (the marked stone), Black can cut at 'a' when White plays W118, White is being captured by one liberty short! W106 reduces one of his own liberty, it is the root cause of trouble, this loss is indeed too big, in fact if White calmly pushes at 'a' with W118, White is still not bad.];B[oq];W[mp];B[no];W[mq];B[or];W[ps];B[nr];W[mr];B[ms];W[ls]
;B[ns];W[lr];B[mo];W[lp]C[W132: White gives up one more stone, this is also an action of losing common senses.];B[lo];W[qq];B[kp];W[lb];B[kb];W[me];B[md];W[nb]LB[lg:a]C[Although White creates a ko with W136 and W140, but the cut at 'a' is a good move! This creates so many ko threats, White can't win this ko.]
;B[nc];W[pp];B[lg];W[nd]C[Although the following situation is still very chaotic, but both sides' state of mind already have changed clearly. White was in a very good situation now becomes unfavorable, particularly White plays W118 first but instead get killed, with this kind of hit it is very hard for most players to restore calmness in such a short time, this can be regarded as the losing cause of the game.];B[mg];W[nf];B[nc];W[kh];B[li];W[if];B[lq];W[nd];B[la]
