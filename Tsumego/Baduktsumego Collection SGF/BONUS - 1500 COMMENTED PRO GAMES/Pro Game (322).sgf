Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[In such an important game of Ing Cup, to keep a calm and normal mind is very hard. But if the state of mind is not good, the quality of game certainly can't be high. As for this game, the psychological burden for each side is very heavy.];W[dc];B[co]C[B3 is rarely seen, and it must have been prepared.];W[pp];B[ce]
;W[ed];B[kc];W[df];B[cg];W[dh];B[nq];W[qn];B[dg]C[As to the cap of W10, the push and cut of B13 is a little unreasonable, but the fighting situation is what Choi Cheolhan likes and is good at.];W[eg];B[eh];W[ch];B[cf];W[ef]
;B[ei];W[bh];B[bc];W[bb];B[bd];W[ck]LB[cb:a]C[W24: If White directly tries to kill Black's big group by playing at 'a', it is very hard to predict the result, but if there is a simple and clear approach, it is also very hard to select deciding the outcome at one stroke.];B[cb];W[ek];B[hd];W[he]C[W28 is a good move! Black is hard to handle.];B[ge]C[B29 is the strongest response, but the result after the exchange is to White's advantage.]
;W[gf];B[hf];W[ie];B[gg];W[gd];B[ff];W[fe];B[dj];W[dk];B[cj];W[bj];B[gc];W[gf]
;B[bi];W[fg];B[bk];W[od];B[id];W[je]LB[ej:a][di:b][aj:c][fi:d]C[W48 is a big slow move! White should play at 'a', next B 'b' and W 'c', Black's atari and W 'd', this way White is favorable.];B[gi]C[B49 is the turning point of the situation.];W[eo];B[dq]
;W[eq];B[dp];W[ep];B[dn];W[ej];B[di];W[jq];B[fm];W[gj];B[hq]C[B61 is severe! White is hard to answer.];W[ho]LB[ip:a]C[W62 is unreasonable, White can only make the diagonal extension at 'a'.]
;B[ip];W[kp];B[jo]C[In the real game, Black's sequence following B65 is tight and powerful.];W[ko];B[gn];W[go];B[jn];W[hn];B[kn];W[mp];B[hm];W[im];B[hl]
;W[hj];B[il]C[B77: Black forces White to make life inside, Black takes a big advantage obviously. Now if it were Lee Changho who sets the pattern, perhaps White will concede defeat in a short time.];W[fr];B[hr];W[dr];B[cr];W[cs];B[br];W[cq];B[cp];W[bs];B[bq];W[en]
;B[em];W[gq];B[es];W[ds];B[pq]LB[jk:a][kk:b]C[But next Choi Cheolhan's play is over-relentless and over-cruel, Black instead gets a bad result, the situation takes a completely turn and becomes extremely hard to judge. From B93, at any time if Black reinforces at 'a' or 'b', White will have a very painful fight, but Choi Cheolhan seems very reluctant to play it.];W[qq];B[op];W[pr];B[fs];W[gs];B[gr]
;W[hp];B[iq];W[fp];B[po];W[oq];B[or];W[mn];B[pq];W[qp];B[oo];W[jl]C[In the end, Whites separates Black, W110 is a good move! The situation suddenly becomes unclear. Sometimes attack is easily excessive, this is perhaps the place where Choi Cheolhan can't compare with Lee Changho.];B[jk];W[kl]
;B[lq];W[kk];B[jr];W[dm]C[After the cut of W116, although Black escapes successfully, but White's outside turns into a thick wall, the situation becomes even.];B[cm];W[dl];B[ij];W[hi];B[kj];W[lj];B[ki];W[li];B[kh]
;W[lh];B[lk];W[mk];B[gh];W[kg];B[jm];W[lm];B[jg];W[ih];B[jh];W[ig];B[ii];W[hh]
;B[kf];W[lg];B[in];W[qf];B[qo];W[ro];B[rp];W[rn];B[rq];W[qr];B[rr];W[oq];B[aj]LB[jf:a]C[Black loses the sente move at 'a', B151 should be reserved.]
;W[jf];B[pq];W[jc];B[jd];W[kd];B[jb];W[lc];B[kb];W[lb]C[After W160, it seems White is easier to play.];B[fc];W[qc]LB[pc:a][ob:b]C[But next W162 is a bad move! This way clearly Black is left with the hane at 'a', White basically can't kill Black! White should jump to 'b', Black can't simply make life, White is not bad.]
;B[pl]C[B163 is a very tough and cruel move! Perhaps Chang Hao overlooks this move. Because in the upper right side, White's aji is no good, here White can't retreat. In the game, White has to release the game-deciding ko move, but this ko is too heavy for White, White can't win it.];W[qk];B[ql];W[rl];B[rk];W[rj];B[pk];W[sk];B[qj];W[qi];B[rk];W[jj];B[ji]
;W[qk];B[hg];W[if];B[rk];W[hk];B[ri]C[B181: Black directly starts the ko, it is very brave! In fact White can still answer the ko, White still can't win the ko fight.];W[qk];B[fn];W[fo];B[rk];W[jp];B[io];W[qk]
;B[km];W[ll]LB[pj:a][pc:b][qb:c]C[When B189, W190 is White's last chance! With W190, White can only eliminate the ko by playing at 'a', then when Black hanes at 'b', White can descend at 'c', this way White can try to kill Black at the maximum limit, perhaps White would still have a chance of winning.];B[rk];W[kr];B[sj];W[js];B[is];W[ir];B[fk];W[fj]
;B[jr];W[ib];B[ik];W[hc];B[oq];W[gl];B[lo];W[qh];B[db];W[lp];B[ks];W[om];B[pn]
;W[ln];B[rg];W[rf];B[qg];W[rh]LB[pg:a]C[In the game, White incurs loss in the exchange. When B215, White has to fight desperately by playing W216, normally if White blocks at 'a', Black will win 4+ points on the board.];B[pg];W[sh];B[rc];W[qb];B[pd];W[rb];B[sg]
;W[oh];B[og];W[oi];B[rd]C[After B227, Black simply makes life, White's big territory has been ruined, White has to concede defeat.

The game 2 will take place on 12/28.])
