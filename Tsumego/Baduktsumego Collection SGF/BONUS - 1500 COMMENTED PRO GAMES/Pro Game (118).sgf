(;SZ[19]EV[China-Korea 1st Lushan Cup Women New Star Ten Game Match game 7]DT[2004-02-14]PC[http://duiyi.tom.com]KM[6.5]PB[Meng Zhaoyu]BR[2p]PW[Gueon Hyojin]WR[4p]RE[B+R]C[Commentary by Meng Zhaoyu 2p.];B[pd]C[Luckily again I had Teacher Nie Weiping to review this game and gave me some instructions. Now let's me pass his instructions.];W[pp];B[dd];W[cp]C[The first four moves are same as the last game, it is a playing psychology.];B[eq]C[With the fifth move, I start to vary and elect to approach inside.]
;W[hp];B[nq];W[lq]LB[jq:a]C[Teacher Nie paused while reviewing the game, and pointed out that invading at 'a' is also possible.];B[pn];W[oq]C[The diagonal of W10 is a fight joseki, this is the right choice when you are strong.];B[np]C[Black extends with B11, leading to a direct confrontation.];W[oo];B[lp];W[kp];B[op];W[po]
;B[pq];W[qq];B[or];W[pr]LB[lo:a][qr:b][dq:c][qn:d]C[W20: White has the state of mind to play atari at 'a', this way the exchange of B13 and W14 would be very damaging. Teacher Nie advised to atari at 'a', next B 'b', W 'c' and B 'd'. I think the situation is about the same.];B[lo];W[kq];B[qr]LB[qn:a]C[Black directly starts the ko with B23, this is the decision I made after a thorough consideration. Black can play big points first, but leaving an unstable group on the board is always a trouble, and also once White has a stone at 'a', this ko would be heavier for White.]
;W[oq];B[dp]LB[pq:a][cq:b][co:c][no:d][pj:e]C[When Black finds the ko threat with B25, my anticipated picture is W 'a', B 'b' or 'c', W 'd' and B 'e', this would lead to an exchange. I think White is relatively satisfied. Teacher Nie also thinks White should play this way.];W[cq]C[In the game White answers the ko threat, after I take the ko, I definitely wouldn't answer to any ko threat.];B[pq];W[do];B[ps];W[eo];B[qn]C[Through B31, it forms a different exchange, I feel Black can be satisfied, because Black has taken three corners. However in the postgame analysis, Gueon Hyojin thinks White is better. Teacher Nie thinks Black is successful, Black is better!]
;W[cf]LB[qf:a][qi:b]C[As to the approach of W32, Teacher Nie feels it is questionable, shouldn't White reduce on the right side by playing at 'a' or 'b'?];B[di]LB[pf:a][fc:b][ee:c][cc:d][eh:e]C[When I showed the clamp of B33, Teacher Nie strongly recommends that Black certainly should protect the corner by playing at 'a', this side Black has much more potential then White, so it is imperative. If White pincers at 'b' next, Black can make the diagonal at 'c' and jump to 'e' to simply handle the situation. When Teacher Nie showed me this variation, I greatly admire Teacher Nie's overall situation judgement. Hope Go fans and friends can also understand this.];W[fc]C[From the counter-pincer of W34 to B43, Black ends in gote, White is successful, and in terms of playing direction, Black contains White's development and White makes an extension at the top, this is also damaging to Black, what the most import is that White obtains sente.];B[fd];W[gd]
;B[fe];W[dc];B[cc];W[ec];B[cd];W[jc];B[dg];W[qf]LB[qi:a][qg:b][ql:c][pc:d][ol:e][on:f][rm:g]C[With the approach of W44, playing the split move at 'a' is better, followed by B 'b', W 'c' and B 'd', W 'e' and W 'g' will turn Black's potential into nothing, White can be satisfied.]
;B[qh]C[Black pincers with B45 then jumps with B47, realizing the big expansion potential.];W[of];B[oh];W[rd];B[hc]LB[gc:a][lc:b][rc:c][qc:d][qd:e][rb:f][pc:g][sc:h][qb:i][mc:j]C[The striking move of B49 is indeed inexplicable, the exchange with W 'a' is very damaging for Black, then what's Black's purpose? I thought I could make the forcing move at 'b' sente, but the price of B49 is huge. Here Teacher Nie suggests one variation, with the sequence from B 'c' to B 'j', Black is basically stable and it is very simple and clear!]
;W[hd]LB[gc:a]C[W50: To connect at 'a' is better, this way later on when Black cuts at 'a', Black's loss wouldn't be that big.];B[lc];W[kc];B[qc];W[rc]LB[ld:a][mc:b][md:c][nc:d][oj:e]C[W54 and B55: Teacher Nie said we two really don't want to "yield an inch", but here the sequence from W 'a' to W 'e' should be more urgent!];B[rb];W[mc]C[The pincer of W56 is to reduce Black's eye shape, but White didn't expect  W56 is the first step leading to her defeat.]
;B[ld];W[lb];B[md];W[nc];B[kb];W[jb];B[mb];W[ka];B[oe];W[ne];B[nd];W[oc];B[od]C[Through B69, White has achieved her goal, however White's situation starts to deteriorate, Black becomes thick and White shows a lonely group, when White starts to escape her lonely group, it helps Black to enclose the territory at the top.]
;W[pb];B[qb];W[og];B[nh];W[mf];B[rf];W[qe];B[lf];W[mg];B[kg];W[kh];B[jh];W[lg]
;B[kf];W[li];B[ji];W[lk];B[qg]LB[nk:a]C[B87 is unnecessary, playing at 'a' should be satisfied.];W[pg];B[oj];W[ph];B[qi]LB[pi:a]C[B91: For Black to block at 'a' should have no problem, but Black couldn't read it thoroughly in overtime.];W[oi]
;B[pi];W[ni];B[gc];W[ic];B[id];W[he];B[hf];W[ie];B[cl];W[gf];B[if];W[ge];B[db]
;W[eb];B[cb];W[nj];B[ok];W[hh];B[gg];W[ff];B[ef];W[fg];B[nb]C[B115 is a panic move, Black incurs a two-point damage! This can't be excused.];W[ob];B[je]LB[hi:a]C[The dame of B117 is inexplicable! Black certainly should attach at 'a'. B115 and B117 are all questionable moves under time pressure, it is too scary! Gueon Hyojin regrets that she didn't kill Black. You must stay calm especially in overtime!]

;W[jf];B[ig];W[ee];B[df];W[ed];B[fk]C[Through B149, Black finally makes life, White's profit is limited, White already can't turn the game around.];W[de];B[ce];W[ma];B[cn];W[dm];B[dn];W[en]
