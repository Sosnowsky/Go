Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[In round 19, two main players from their teams Luo Xihe and Gu Li meet each other, this game is paid most attention in this round of team tournament. Both players defeated Lee Sedol in recent international tournaments, their state is very good.];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[fc];W[cf]
;B[kc];W[qn];B[qp];W[pj];B[qh];W[on];B[pm]LB[rj:a]C[Black first strikes with B13, White has state of mind to protect with one move at 'a'.];W[pn];B[mq];W[rj];B[db];W[kq]LB[ro:a][fq:b]C[W18: White seals off "iron" head, it seems surprising. White is perhaps more interested in the benefit of making diagonal at 'a'. Normally White will make small-knight's move at 'b'.]
;B[cn];W[cl];B[fq];W[cq]C[The small diagonal of W22 leads to a fierce fight.];B[dl];W[dk];B[dm];W[dj];B[fo];W[en];B[eo];W[do];B[dn]
;W[fn];B[gn];W[fm];B[fl];W[gm];B[ek];W[co];B[bn];W[go];B[eq];W[hq]C[The play of W40 and W42 is a little far-fetched.];B[bp]LB[dr:a][cr:b]C[B43: Black should make diagonal at 'a', after W 'b', then B43, this way the fight will be to Black's advantage.]

;B[np];W[op]C[The pincer of W58 is a good move.];B[nq];W[no];B[mr]C[B59 and B61: Black perhaps can only play this way.];W[jm];B[jq];W[kr];B[km];W[jl];B[kn];W[mo]
;B[ko];W[lp];B[fh];W[ro];B[rp];W[sp];B[sq];W[so];B[rr];W[ge];B[bk]C[B79 is a good move.];W[bl];B[dh]
;W[bj]C[W82: White seems to have no other choices but to defend this way.];B[gj]C[Black gets to turn with B83 in sente, Black gains.];W[eg];B[fg];W[ef];B[eh];W[cg];B[hl];W[gl];B[hk];W[hm];B[er]
;W[bo];B[ao];W[bs];B[jj];W[kl];B[jr]C[Through B99, Black makes life smoothly and Black's situation is not bad.];W[hd];B[cc];W[oc];B[be];W[bf];B[pc]LB[ke:a]C[B105: Black can consider to jump at 'a' to achieve balance for the whole game by sacrificing some territory.]
;W[od];B[qf]LB[pf:a][of:b][ke:c]C[B107 is a slow move. Black should make small knight's move at 'a', if White attaches at 'b', Black can take tenuki. If White still caps at 'c', then Black's knight's move at 'a' will help Black in the fight.];W[pe];B[qe];W[ke];B[if]C[B111: Black plans to settle the shape by sacrificing, Black's judgement is clear.];W[jg]C[W112: But White is not willing to accept, here again it leads to a fierce fight.];B[jf];W[kf]
;B[kg];W[kh];B[lg];W[jh];B[lj]LB[kj:a][ll:b][lh:c][hg:d]C[B119: If Black doubles at 'a', Black can capture three white stones. However, next W 'b', B 'c' and W 'd', White can sacrifice three stones, White's situation is not bad.];W[kj]C[The wedge of W120 is excellent, White's three stones have escaped.];B[hg]C[Following B121, Black has to deal with this miserable game and already can't control the situation.];W[jd]

;B[ij];W[il];B[ik];W[hb];B[ob];W[nb];B[pb];W[mc];B[nk];W[hi];B[gi]C[Through B159, White reserves the privilege of capturing two stones, this is not only a question of points, and also most importantly White's big dragon is left with a "back door".];W[pk]C[Thus, following W160, White is much easier to handle the right side.]
