;B[no];W[pp];B[nq];W[qq];B[oq];W[qn]LB[qr:a]C[W24 is a very simple and rarely seen play, generally, White doesn't want to let Black hane at 'a' with sente.];B[qr];W[rq];B[ip];W[dr];B[nm]LB[nn:a][be:b][oc:c]C[I can't agree to the conception of the three moves B29, B 'a' and B 'b', I think for Black to protect the corner at around 'c' would be bigger.]
;W[od];B[oc];W[nc];B[pc];W[md];B[nn]LB[ge:a]TR[mp]C[B35: At any rate, Black should jump to 'a', this is the crucial point for the moyo expansion and reduction of both sides! In the game, probably Black is satisfied with capturing the marked white stone, but Black has spent two moves here, it seems Black is falling behind in the opening.];W[gf];B[be]LB[je:a]C[The hane of B37 appears slack, White doesn't have any severe invasion maneuver on the left side, so Black should play at 'a'.];W[ef]
;B[df];W[jf]C[After White encloses the territory with W40, White is a little favorable for the game.];B[lf];W[nf];B[lh];W[kg];B[lg];W[ke];B[er];W[cj]LB[eq:a][fr:b][en:c][bj:d]C[The attachment of W48 seems strong, actually that's not the case. It would be better for White to squeeze at 'a' directly, then B 'b', W 'c'. Later on, striking at 'd' is the vital point!]
;B[bj];W[dk];B[dj];W[ci];B[dl];W[ek];B[bl];W[el];B[dm]C[After this move, it is time for lunch break.];W[ei];B[bi];W[ch];B[bh]
;W[cq]LB[bc:a]C[As for the result up to 62, White instead has incurred some losses, Black's points are still same, and White's outside is not thick either, White is clearly not beneficial. What the most important is, Black is left with the big endgame play at 'a', after this variation, the game instantly becomes close.];B[pf]LB[rm:a][rr:b][il:c][rl:d]C[B63: Normally Black will make the knight's move at 'a' to exchange for W 'b', then play B63, but perhaps Black wants badly to get the good point at 'c', so Black intentionally leaves White the knight's move at 'd'. This is also Lee Changho's characteristic, it appears that he has not played very well earlier, but he will never get annihilated at one stroke.];W[rl];B[kf];W[je];B[il];W[gp]
;B[fp];W[go]LB[io:a]C[The retreat of W70 is a steady move, if the situation is unfavorable, White can also think to attach at 'a', it would be fierce and both sides are very dangerous.];B[hq];W[jj];B[hk];W[gl];B[gk];W[kk];B[jm];W[pg];B[qf];W[hm]LB[qh:a][qk:b]C[W78 and W80: It is a pity that White has accomplished nothing! In this situation, the most imperative is not how to attack but how to protect territory! It would be better if White checks at 'a' directly, then B79 and W 'b'.]
;B[kl];W[og];B[ed];W[ec];B[nh];W[ii];B[jg];W[ig];B[jh];W[ih];B[bc]C[In the game White ends in gote, the jump of B91 is huge! The game becomes very close now.];W[bd];B[ad]
;W[bf];B[ae];W[cc];B[bb];W[cb];B[bg];W[mk];B[fn]C[The jump of B101 is a good move! White appears somewhat thin right away.];W[mi];B[ng];W[of];B[ni];W[fh]
;B[ob]C[B107: Black again tenukis to grab the endgame, White must feel very painful!];W[mm];B[lj];W[lk];B[ln];W[nb];B[na];W[ma];B[oa];W[lb];B[rh];W[ki]LB[li:a]C[The exchange of W118 and B 'a' is a little damaging to White.]
;B[li];W[rr];B[fd];W[gd];B[ba]C[The stand of B123 is a counter-sente endplay, and it also has endgame follow-up maneuvers.];W[lm];B[kn];W[in];B[jo];W[rj];B[kh];W[mj];B[oj]
;W[io]LB[gn:a]C[W132: For White to simply attach at 'a' would be better.];B[gq];W[gn];B[ao];W[bo];B[an];W[ap];B[bm];W[bn];B[am];W[bq];B[ca]

;B[le];W[ld];B[hf];W[qs]LB[rs:a]C[The hane of W186 is not prudent, White certainly should stand at 'a', this is related to ko threats.];B[gg];W[ac]LB[gh:a]C[W188 is the losing move!  White didn't expect Black would ignore it! Lee Changho is very alert here! After Black pushes at 'a', White has to answer, Black has scored again. In fact, if White just blocks at 'a', it would be a half-point game and hard to tell who will win.];B[gh];W[gi]C[In the second half of the game, it is Lee Changho's one man show, again we have enjoyed his brilliant endgame skill.];B[fj]
