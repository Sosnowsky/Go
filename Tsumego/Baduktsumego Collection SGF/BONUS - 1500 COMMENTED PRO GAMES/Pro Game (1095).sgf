In the first game, Lee Changho luckily won by half point.];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[fc]

;B[db];W[eb];B[cb];W[ec];B[cf];W[qf]C[Through W24, the opening is exactly same as that in the final game of Chunlan Cup final between Lee Changho and Zhou Heyang. In that game, next Zhou Heyang elected to approach the left side corner with the small knight's move, in this game, Choi Cheolhan elects to play relatively intense invasion.];B[qh]LB[lc:a]C[Considering when White forces with W28, Black's worry-free corner may feel restricted, with B25 for Black to make two-space extension at 'a' is also a good and calm move.];W[of];B[oh];W[mc];B[md]
;W[ld];B[nd];W[mf];B[le];W[kd];B[oj]LB[ql:a]C[B35 is a little slow, Black should consider to invade at 'a'.];W[qi]LB[ql:a]C[The bump of W36 is a common tactic, guarding against Black's invasion at 'a' in sente.];B[rh];W[pd];B[pc]
;W[rd]LB[ph:a]C[W38 and W40 are good moves to block crossover, Black needs to prevent White from playing wedge and cut at 'a', Black's movement is not so liberal.];B[qe];W[re];B[qc];W[pe];B[me];W[rc];B[rb];W[sb];B[ra];W[ng];B[pk]LB[sh:a][ql:b]C[B51 is a bad move, making the opponent thicker immediately. Because Black's descent at 'a' is sente, Black's invasion at 'b' will work.]
;W[qk];B[mi];W[lh];B[ke];W[mh]C[After White forms a good shape with W56, White's tempo is smooth.];B[li];W[ki];B[kj];W[pp]C[W60: White should play in the middle, in the real game, the squeezing move in the lower right corner perhaps is a "forcing" move under time pressure, also we can't eliminate the possibility that Mr. Lee "sells" a defect on purpose.];B[kh];W[ji];B[kg]C[Black can't tolerate and is forced to counterattack with B61 and B63.]
;W[ni]C[The hane of W64 is the winning move.];B[oi]LB[nj:a][ph:b]C[B65: If Black blocks at 'a', White can wedge at 'b', Black is clearly not good, so Black can only fight desperately as in the real game.];W[nj];B[mk];W[nk];B[nh];W[nl];B[mg];W[lg];B[lf]
;W[mg];B[ml]LB[og:a][rf:b][kl:c]C[During the process, with B75 if Black plays atari at 'a', then cuts at 'b', White can capture Black's key stones by playing at 'c'.];W[mm];B[mj];W[og];B[ph];W[rg]C[However, through W80, Black is not favorable in the capturing race.];B[ql];W[rl]
;B[pl];W[qm];B[sg];W[sf];B[nm]C[With the sequence following B87, Black is forced to sacrifice stones.];W[om];B[nn];W[ol];B[on];W[pm];B[op];W[qq];B[rq]
;W[qr];B[rr];W[rn];B[so];W[id]C[The diagonal of W100 is calm and declaration of victory.];B[jj];W[gq];B[iq];W[ij];B[ik]LB[ii:a]C[B105: If Black first cuts at 'a', the situation is a little chaotic.];W[ii]
;B[ie];W[jk];B[lm];W[kk];B[lj];W[jp]TR[mm]C[W112 is a strong move to break the ladder, aiming to escape the marked stone.];B[jl];W[hk];B[il];W[ip];B[hl];W[he]
