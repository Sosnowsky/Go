;W[ce];B[cf];W[cd];B[fq];W[cn];B[df];W[fc];B[dj]LB[cj:a]C[The high extension of B13 is fresh, the common move is to make low extension at 'a'.];W[oc];B[pe];W[qk];B[qi]
;W[qo];B[np];W[ok];B[oi];W[lq];B[pl];W[ql]LB[pk:a]C[W24: If White connects at 'a', Black can attach down at 24, it will lead to a complicated fight. In the real game, the crawl of W24 is simple and clear.];B[dr];W[iq];B[cq];W[nr]C[The knight's move of W28 is severe.]
;B[po];W[pn];B[qp];W[oo];B[pp];W[rn];B[lp];W[kp];B[on]C[Black cuts with B37 painstakingly, giving up one stone.];W[nn];B[mq];W[lo]LB[mr:a]C[Due to the exchange of B37 and W38, with W40 White can't block at 'a'.]
;B[ro];W[qn];B[mr];W[mp];B[nq]C[Through B45, Black finally handles well and obtains some territory, however Black's loss on the outside is also very big.];W[bk];B[ci]LB[bj:a][cj:b][ck:c][bi:d]C[B47: Black is too optimistic. Black should attach at 'a', if White plays wedge at 'b', then B 'c', W47 and B 'd', Black is not afraid of a fight.];W[lc];B[cl]
;W[bl];B[bo];W[dl];B[pc];W[od];B[oe];W[ge];B[ie];W[ne];B[md]C[The strike of B59 is a strong move!];W[ld]LB[mc:a][nd:b]C[Following W60, White sacrifices to take the whole game into account, White is very brave. However with W60 for White to exchange W 'a' and B 'b', then select the real game play is strategically better.]
;B[me];W[le];B[mf];W[lf];B[mc];W[mb];B[nb];W[lb];B[ob]C[Through B69, Black obtains some territory.];W[hg]C[W70: White starts to attack.];B[ig];W[hh]
;B[dd];W[cc];B[ih];W[ii];B[kh];W[if];B[fd]LB[ed:a][id:b]C[B79 is an asking move, if White plays wedge at 'a', Black will connect out strongly at 'b'.];W[gd];B[jf];W[hf];B[lg]

;B[dn];W[dk];B[fh];W[ri];B[rh];W[rj];B[qg];W[kj];B[fn];W[li];B[hn];W[mg]C[The cut of W108 is a good endgame! White forces Black to capture by reducing liberties, White takes a little advantage.];B[mh]
;W[ng];B[nh];W[lh];B[kg];W[nf];B[nc];W[ki];B[og];W[bg]C[The strike of W118 is again a good endgame, however this is also White's privilege.];B[bf];W[bi];B[ch];W[bh]
;B[fe];W[lr];B[ls];W[im]C[After White comes back and seals off with W126, it is a close game with White having a slight advantage.];B[jh];W[ji];B[of];W[kf];B[nd];W[jg];B[mg];W[in];B[rp]
;W[gp];B[gq];W[ks]LB[eo:a]C[The purpose of W138 is not clear. For White to directly take action by peeping at 'a' is working. This way White will be favorable.];B[hp];W[ms];B[or];W[dm];B[bn];W[ip];B[ho];W[no]LB[pj:a]C[W146 is the last losing move. White should make diagonal at 'a'.]
;B[pk]C[The simple push of B147 is brilliant! And it is also the winning move of the game. White must have overlooked this move.];W[ol];B[nj];W[nk];B[mj];W[mk];B[pj]C[After Black connects back with B153, the situation has been turned around.];W[fg];B[eg];W[gh]C[W154 and W156 are local good endgames, but not enough to overturn the game.];B[ff];W[fi]
