;W[cj]LB[ed:a]C[The four-space "pincer" of W6 is now very popular, because Black most likely will press with the knight's move at 'a', so overall for White to stay further from Black's thickness is better.];B[ge]C[The play of B7 is a trend.];W[fc];B[ed];W[cd];B[ec];W[eb];B[de]LB[fb:a][gb:b][fd:c][fa:d][gc:e]C[But B13 is a little slow, Black should cut at 'a', if White ataris at 'b', then B 'c', W 'd' and B 'e', this is more efficient.]
;W[gb];B[ch]C[Through B15, Black is a little dissatisfied.];W[be];B[bf];W[cn]LB[bd:a]C[W18: White can connect at 'a', this way White's shape in the upper right corner is good and complete.];B[iq];W[qo];B[qk]C[The remote pincer of B21 is a good move.];W[jp];B[ip];W[jo]C[W22 and W24 also fit Go's theory.]
;B[kr];W[no]LB[op:a]C[W26: White can also press at 'a'.];B[oo];W[on];B[op];W[ql];B[pn];W[pk]C[W30 and W32 are positive.];B[om];W[nn];B[rm]LB[pm:a][rn:b]C[B35: For Black to connect at 'a' is also very powerful, if White makes the diagonal at 35, Black can attach at 'b', this way Black can threaten White's several stones in the center by using his thickness in the upper left corner, this variation is better than the real game.]
;W[pm];B[qm];W[pl];B[rl];W[qj];B[rk];W[po];B[qn];W[pj];B[ro];W[np];B[nq]LB[fq:a]C[B47: Black should make the two-space extension at 'a'. In the game, Black gains about 10 points of territory, but White's influence in the center is big, White has nothing to complain.]

;B[lo];W[lm];B[kn];W[jl];B[km];W[kl];B[ll];W[mm];B[or];W[jm];B[ns];W[lk]LB[jn:a]C[W72: White should atari at 'a', to avoid other variations.]
;B[oc]LB[bd:a]C[B72: Black can also take one stone at 'a'.];W[bd];B[dj];W[ck];B[ci];W[gg]LB[fh:a]C[W78: White should play at 'a' to destroy Black's territory and eye space by using his own thickness.];B[dk];W[dl];B[el];W[dm]
;B[fg];W[gh];B[fh];W[gi]C[Through W86, White spends one extra move and White is a little damaging.];B[pg];W[fq]LB[eq:a]C[W88 is an overplay, the original move is to make the diagonal  extension at 'a'.];B[bm];W[bl];B[cq]C[B89 and B91 are good moves, White's aji in the corner is very bad.];W[er];B[dr]

;W[fo];B[hp];W[fp];B[em];W[fn];B[gm];W[bp];B[gn];W[ao]C[Through W128, although White finally manages to ensure the corner territory, but Black's gain in outside influence is huge.];B[jn]C[When Black pushes with B129, Black is already favorable in the game.];W[in];B[ms]
;W[oe]C[W132 is a game-deciding move.];B[ml];W[ol];B[ng]LB[pe:a]C[B135 sacrificing territory is very dangerous, Black should make the diagonal extension at 'a', protecting the corner territory.];W[qe];B[pd];W[pe];B[nd];W[ne];B[me];W[mf]
;B[nf];W[rd];B[rc];W[lf];B[le];W[qg];B[qh];W[ph]C[W148 and W150 are good moves.];B[oh];W[rh];B[pi];W[rf]C[Through W154, Black territory is ruined, the game becomes chaotic.]
;B[nl];W[om];B[mj]LB[kf:a][lg:b]C[B157 is the losing move, Black should hane at 'a' to exchange with W 'b'.];W[kf]C[After White extends out with W18, White's shape is too beautiful.];B[nj];W[qi];B[ki];W[hl];B[gl]LB[if:a]C[B163 is the last losing move, Black should cap at 'a' to fight with White.]
