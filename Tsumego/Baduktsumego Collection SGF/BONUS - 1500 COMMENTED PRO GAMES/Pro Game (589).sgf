;B[po]LB[jp:a]C[B7: Black doesn't elect to pincer at around 'a', Lee Changho hopes to start with a steady opening and fight a prolonged war.];W[jp];B[cn];W[cl];B[fc];W[id];B[cf];W[fd];B[gd];W[fe];B[cc];W[ec]
;B[cd];W[fb];B[cq];W[dq];B[cp];W[do];B[bn];W[em];B[nc]C[After the corner-approach of B9, the opening comes to an end after B27, Black takes all four corners, White is thick at the top and bottom.];W[ok]C[White caps with W28, the game enters into the middle-game fight.];B[kc]LB[qe:a][ql:b]C[B29: For Black to protect the corner with the diagonal at 'a' is steady, this way White's attachment at 'a' is not working any more.]
;W[ql];B[pl]C[White attaches down with W30, Black has no way to retreat and has to fight with the hane of B31, at any rate, this is what Lee Sedol likes.];W[pk];B[pm];W[qj];B[rk];W[qq]C[The attachment of W36 is a good move.];B[pp]LB[qp:a][rj:b][qd:c]C[B37: If Black hangs at 'a', White would already take advantage, White is still left with the block at 'b', then White can attach at 'c' to take more advantage, Black can't tolerate. Therefore, Black counterattacks with B37.];W[ro]C[The knight's move of W38 is also a good move related to W36.]
;B[rj]LB[qr:a][rm:b][qn:c][qi:d][ri:e][rh:f]C[B39: Black must crawl first, if Black directly hanes at 'a', then W 'b', B 'c', W 'd' and B 'e', Black can hane at 'f', Black is no good.];W[qi]LB[qr:a][or:b][nq:c][oq:d]C[W40: White can consider to descend at 'a', next B40, W 'b' and B 'c', White can push at 'd'.];B[ri]LB[qr:a][nm:b]C[Although Black crawls on the second line, but Black can hane at 'a' and also can jump out at 'b' later on, Black is successful in this fight, now the game is to Black's advantage.]

;B[oc];W[rq];B[rr];W[qm];B[rg];W[rf];B[sf];W[re]LB[se:a][qf:b]C[W62: If White blocks at 'a', then Black can cut and atari at 'b', White is fraught with grim possibilities.];B[nm];W[sl];B[sk]LB[sn:a][rp:b]C[Moreover, after B65, if White makes a ko at 'a', Black can wedge at 'b' to form a multi-stage ko, this ko is very damaging to White, White basically has no chance of winning this ko fight.]
;W[cr]C[W66: White is forced to turn to other place to fight, in a favorable situation, Black becomes conservative.];B[br];W[dr];B[bl];W[be]C[After this move it is time for noon break.];B[ce];W[bk];B[ck];W[cj];B[dk];W[bm];B[dl]
;W[al];B[dm];W[ch];B[bf];W[db];B[cb];W[ei]LB[fk:a]C[With W84 White must make the knight's move at 'a', forming a big moyo, this way White perhaps has a chance of winning.];B[dj];W[di];B[bj];W[ci];B[en]
;W[dn];B[cm];W[fm];B[fk]LB[hn:a][bs:b][an:c][am:d]C[B93: Black can reduce at 'a', in the corner if White hanes at 'b', then B 'c' is working, White can only answer at 'd', a ko will result. Although White has many ko threats on the right side, but White still has very little chance to win this ko.];W[hm];B[mr];W[kr];B[kn]LB[rd:a][qe:b][se:c]C[B97: Black should atari at 'a', if White connects, Black can crossover at 'c'.]
;W[se]C[W98 is a vital point.];B[sn];W[jn]C[Through W100, White encloses side territory, White obtains profit.];B[ib];W[ne];B[ke];W[ko]C[W104 is too early.];B[lr];W[bl];B[bs];W[no];B[nq]

;W[lh]LB[kb:a]C[W148 is slow, White should directly hang at 'a', this way Black's two groups are still unstable.];B[og];W[pg];B[nb];W[kb];B[hg];W[jb];B[jc];W[jg];B[if];W[hb];B[ic]
