Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[In this game, Xie He used his special talent and contained Song TaeKon for the whole game, eventually won the game by killing a big dragon with just 100+ moves.];W[dc];B[pq];W[dp];B[ce]
;W[dh];B[cn];W[dk];B[fq];W[dn];B[cq];W[cm]LB[co:a]C[W12: Normally White will hang at 'a', the play in the game puts more emphasis on the top.];B[co]LB[dq:a]C[B13 is a new move, the common move is to crawl at 'a'.];W[cp]C[The counterattack of W14 is inevitable, leading to a fierce fight in the opening.]
;B[do];W[ep];B[dm];W[cl];B[bp];W[bq];B[bo];W[cr];B[fo];W[fp];B[gp];W[go]LB[gq:a]C[W26 is correct move, to cut at 'a' is not big.]
;B[eo];W[er];B[hp];W[gn];B[em];W[gk]C[W32 is beautiful move, White seals Black inside from the opening, generally it is favorable.];B[bm];W[kp]C[W34 is an excellent point to attack!];B[io];W[nq]C[After White takes advantage in sente with W36, .....];B[po];W[iq]C[W38 again hits Black's vital point. Xie He's several moves must have made Song TaeKon very uncomfortable.]
;B[im];W[fn];B[en];W[jn];B[in];W[no]LB[lq:a]C[W44 is a good and calm move, comparing with three stones in the middle, Black's invasion at 'a' is more severe and must be prevented.];B[ik];W[hi]C[W46 is tasteful, influence in the center is bigger than normal big points. As for the result, Song TaeKon's novel move of B13 fails.];B[nc]LB[dg:a]C[B47: The upper-left corner is urgent, for Black to play at 'a' is relatively better.]
;W[qm];B[rn];W[cd];B[ed];W[de];B[ec];W[gc]LB[dd:a]C[W54: White attacks with B54 with a favorable ladder, its power is astonishing! Normally to answer at 'a' can be satisfied. Here it shows Xie He's unique thinking.];B[gd];W[hd];B[hc]LB[ge:a]C[B57 is questionable, to extend at 'a' is better.]
;W[ge];B[gb];W[fd];B[fc];W[ee]C[Through W62, White obtains a complete outside influence and can be satisfied.];B[gd];W[fe];B[id];W[he];B[bk];W[kd];B[ie];W[kf]
;B[jc];W[ne];B[qi]LB[pe:a]C[B73: For Black to make diagonal at 'a' is better.];W[kc]LB[eb:a]C[W74 is sente, otherwise White will exploit at 'a', Black can't tolerate.];B[eb];W[pe]C[W76 is simple and clear.];B[pd]LB[qe:a][oc:b]C[If B77 at 'a', White will attach at 'b', Black can't resist.]
;W[qe];B[re];W[rf];B[rd];W[qg]C[Through W82, White is clearly favorable.];B[nn]LB[om:a]C[B83 big-capturing W48 is hasty! Black starts a desperately fight, but Black in the center has no eye space, too thin! If Black makes knight at 'a', the game still can continue.];W[mn];B[nm];W[mm];B[nl];W[oo]
;B[pn];W[fl]C[W90: White cuts Black's way to retreat, Black's dragon in the center is dangerous.];B[mg]LB[ii:a]C[At this crucial moment, Song TaeKon loses fighting spirit, B91 is inexplicable, to escape quickly at 'a' is normal.];W[jj]C[W92: White doesn't hesitate to kill the dragon, however at the top Black didn't gain anything, the game is suddenly over.];B[lk];W[pi]C[W94: White seeks safety and it is very steady move.];B[pj];W[oi];B[qj]LB[kl:a]C[B97: Black can escape at 'a', but White will cut at 97, Black also will suffer a big defeat.]
