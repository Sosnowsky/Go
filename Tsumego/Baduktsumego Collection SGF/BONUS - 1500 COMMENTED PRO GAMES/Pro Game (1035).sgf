Translation:GoGameWorld.];B[pd]C[It is the best encourage to all our professional players that Zhou Heyang won the champion in this Asian Cup Fast Game event! Because I feel we are in the same level as in the top list of rank players, Heyang can do it, we can also do it!];W[dp]C[Although Mimura Tomoyasu is not that famous, but in Japan, he belongs to the style of strength and power and is very talented. However in this game he clearly didn't play well, perhaps because of nervousness. Of course, Japanese Go world also needs some aspirations, what both sides are competing in the game is certainly not just skill.];B[fq];W[cn];B[pq]

;B[er];W[bq];B[hq]LB[gr:a]C[B19: Black should hang at 'a', if so, White still has to make the knight's move with W20, then Black can tenuki.];W[go]LB[gr:a]C[In the game, after the knight's move of W20, because Black needs to prevent White's tactic of striking at 'a', Black can't play somewhere else.];B[ho];W[hn];B[in]C[Probably Mimura couldn't find a good maneuver to strengthen, so he elects to counterattack with B21 and B23, but he has clearly misread the ladder!];W[hp];B[io]
;W[ip]LB[gp:a]C[When White pushes with W26, Black can no longer cut at 'a', so Black is forced to give up stones, however what he gave up is not all useless stones.];B[jn];W[gr];B[gq];W[hr];B[ko]C[So far, although Mimura 9p has a high fighting will, but the steady Heyang doesn't forget to counterattack while making two eyes, he did his job with skill and ease.];W[gp];B[jp];W[kq];B[hm];W[nj]
