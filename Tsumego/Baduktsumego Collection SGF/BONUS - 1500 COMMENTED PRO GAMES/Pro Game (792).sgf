;B[dp];W[gn];B[cr]LB[gr:a][hr:b][oq:c]C[B21: Black is willing to take gote and has a wait-and-see attitude. If Black first exchanges B 'a' and W 'b', then protects the corner at 'c', this way Black's speed in the opening is fast.];W[oq];B[po];W[mp];B[oc]LB[pl:a][kq:b]C[B25: Black can make extension at 'a', aiming to invade at 'b', this fits into Black's plan with B21.]
;W[pm]C[The clamp of W26 is a good move, through W30, White forms an ideal shape.];B[pq];W[op];B[pr];W[nm];B[df];W[ed];B[di];W[fk];B[jd]C[After this move, it is time for lunch break.];W[ph];B[gc]
;W[or]LB[qn:a]C[The block of W38 is an intense sente move, otherwise White can make the diagonal at 'a', Black's corner will be exploited.];B[qm];W[ql];B[qn];W[jj]C[After White takes the vital point of moyo with W42, White's moyo is bigger.];B[ko]C[B43: Black invades deeply, although it shows Cho's 9p braveness, but it is also imperative.];W[km]C[After the cap of W44,  it is inevitable for Black to feel a little painful.];B[io];W[iq];B[jm]
;W[jl];B[il]LB[im:a][kn:b]C[B49 is a strong move, if Black simply extends at 'a', White will bump at 'b', Black has no answer.
];W[im];B[jn];W[hl]C[After this move, the game was closed for the first day.];B[ik];W[jk];B[hm];W[gm];B[in]
;W[ij];B[hk];W[gl]LB[gj:a][ei:b]C[The play from W52 to W60 is very thick, if Black really wants to get out with the diagonal at 'a', White can attach at 'b', Black inevitably can't look after both sides.];B[mo]C[B61: Black starts from this side.];W[lp];B[lm];W[nn];B[kl];W[lk];B[ml]

;B[pn];W[pk];B[li];W[ni];B[lj];W[jp];B[np];W[mr];B[kh]C[After paying the price of letting White protect the lower and right side, Black finally sticks the head out with the small diagonal of B89 , but Black comes under attack again by White with the sequence following W90.];W[je];B[ke];W[kf];B[jf]
;W[jg];B[ie];W[kg];B[lg];W[lf];B[mg];W[mf];B[ng];W[pd]LB[pc:a][nf:b][of:c][qe:d]C[W102 is a good move, next if Black blocks at 'a', then W 'b', B 'c' and W 'd', Black has no answer.]

;B[fi];W[ge];B[fb]C[Afterwards, the defense and offense are very intense, but Black doesn't have a chance to win all the time. Although it forms a life-and-death big ko after B197, unfortunately Black doesn't have enough ko threats.];W[ic];B[jc];W[ib];B[hd];W[kb];B[db];W[cb];B[ec];W[dd];B[lc]
