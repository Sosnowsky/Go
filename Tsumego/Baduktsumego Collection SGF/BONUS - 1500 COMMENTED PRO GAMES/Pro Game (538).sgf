This game appears in many Go textbooks, it is a classical and famous game. The attachment of B99 just conforms to the proverb "make a feint to the east and attack in the west".];B[qd];W[qp];B[cd];W[dq];B[co]LB[ec:a]C[Whether Black first approaches the corner with B5 or protect the corner at 'a' depends on players' state of mind.]
;W[ec];B[hd];W[ch]LB[cc:a][fd:b]C[W8: White doesn't elect to play at 'a' or 'b' as in the joseki but counter-pincers with W8, which is a trend.];B[ed]LB[dc:a][fd:b]TR[co]C[The attachment and press of B9 is inevitable, if Black directly makes the diagonal's hit at 'a', White will play at 'b', because the marked stone is in a low position, Black can't be satisfied.];W[ck];B[dc]C[Since White has already made the extension on the side with W10, the tiger's move of B11 is inevitable to keep balance.];W[cp]
;B[do];W[fq]C[White makes the diagonal's extension of W12, forcing White to extend with B13, then White makes one-space extension with W14, it is Kitani's style.];B[oq]LB[nc:a]C[B15: For Black to protect the corner at 'a' is better.];W[nc];B[pc];W[kc]C[After the two moves of W16 and W18, the original black potential at the top has completely disappeared, White can be satisfied.];B[qn];W[pq]C[The diagonal's hit of W20 is to avoid fierce fights and seek safety.];B[pp];W[qr]C[The tiger's move of W22 is a tesuji in this situation.]
;B[pr];W[qq];B[po];W[or];B[nr];W[ps];B[np];W[hb];B[pi]C[B31 is an eye-catching big point.];W[mq];B[nq];W[hp];B[el]C[The reinforcing move of B35 is worth praising.]
;W[cm]C[W36: White first ruins Black's base, hoping to attack when the time is ripe.];B[dm];W[kp]C[W38: White elects to strengthen the lower side, while seeing Black's moyo can't be reinforced completely with just one move on the right side.];B[ne]C[B39: Black reinforces himself and puts pressure on White as well, it is highly efficient move.];W[pk];B[qi]C[As to the high invasion of W40, B41 is a good move, not giving White any chance for making sabaki plays.];W[od];B[pf];W[pd];B[qc];W[of]
;B[oe];W[pe];B[qe];W[nb];B[nk]LB[pg:a]C[B51: Black elects to cap with B51 instead of making an extension at 'a', it is a positive play.];W[pg];B[qf];W[ng];B[le];W[lg];B[oh]LB[oj:a]TR[pk]C[The peep of B57 is a good move, indirectly preventing the marked white stone from moving out at 'a'.]
;W[ke];B[lc]C[B59 is a clever move.];W[lb];B[kd]LB[kf:a]C[The wedge of B61 is a bad move, Black should hane out at 'a'.];W[jd];B[ld];W[jc];B[kf];W[je];B[lf];W[li]C[After White jumps out with W68, the game is slightly to White's advantage.]
;B[dj];W[cj];B[nh];W[mh];B[og]C[With B71 and B73, Black first takes territory.];W[fc];B[fd];W[rn];B[rm];W[ro]C[White grabs territory with W76 and W78 in sente, it is very big.];B[ql];W[lk]
;B[mj];W[lj];B[jf];W[gc];B[mm];W[ml];B[lm]LB[nl:a]C[B87 is a game-deciding move after Black sees the game is not to his favor, otherwise, Black would block at 'a'.];W[nl];B[kh]C[B89 taking White's eye shape is the vital point, White is dangerous.];W[pm];B[pl]
;W[ol];B[lo];W[oj]LB[qk:a][rk:b][jj:c]C[W94 is unreasonable and is the losing move of the game, White should exchange W 'a' for B 'b', then escape at 'c'.];B[ni];W[nj];B[mi];W[mk]C[W98: Although White captures one black stone and makes one eye, but ends in gote.];B[ip];W[iq]
;B[jq]C[The hane of B101 is strong and unyielding! It is a pre-planned move since the attachment of B99.];W[jp];B[io];W[kq];B[hq];W[jr];B[ir];W[jq];B[gp];W[hr];B[ho];W[gq]C[After taking one stone with B109 and B111, Black becomes thick and prepares to attack White in the middle.]
;B[jj];W[jk];B[jm]C[B115 is a good move, not only strengthening himself but also attacking White.];W[qk];B[rk];W[qm];B[rl];W[on];B[pn];W[om];B[mp]C[B123 is an inevitable move.];W[oo]
;B[op];W[ij];B[ji];W[jl];B[kl];W[kk];B[im];W[gk];B[hi];W[hj];B[hl];W[gl];B[gi]C[As to W134, Black first peeps with B135 then extends with B137, it is an excellent sequence.]
;W[hm];B[il];W[ik];B[fm];W[gm];B[fn]C[Through B143, White has completely lost his eye shape in the center, the only hope is to get into a capturing race while Black at the bottom has no eye shape either, but this hope is very remote.];W[fj];B[gj];W[fk];B[hk];W[jn];B[in];W[kn]
;B[km];W[lh];B[fi];W[dk];B[cn];W[fp];B[fo];W[en]C[White ruins eyes bluntly with W158, but it is already too late.];B[bm];W[bl];B[bp])
