;B[cn];W[fq];B[ci]C[B7: Black forms the very popular "Mini Chinese Fuseki".];W[kc];B[nc];W[hc];B[fc];W[he];B[bp];W[cq];B[dl];W[qn]C[W16 is a favorite "small knight" of Lee Changho, White is waiting for Black to strike out.]
;B[gf]C[B17: Black aims to enclose the left side territory by attacking.];W[cd]C[W18 is the achievement of Chinese players in the recent research, in the upper left where Black has relatively more stones, W18 looks like a "depth bomb".];B[cc]
(;W[cg]LB[bc:a][bb:b][ch:c]C[W20: White's normal play is to hane at 'a', then B 'b' and W 'c' (see var a), the play of W20 is obviously to Lee Sedol's surprise, Lee Sedol is pondering ...];B[bd]LB[di:a][cj:b][eg:c][ge:d][fi:e]C[B21: Black elects to grab some territory and in the meantime take away White's base, it is a very safe and substantial play. Lee Changho drinks some tea, over here it may lead to the variation of W 'a', B 'b', W 'c', B 'd' and W 'e' (see var a).]
(;W[ei]TR[cg][cd]C[The elephant jump of W22 is very flexible, even if the marked two stones can be captured, the aji of Black's center territory is not good.];B[ck]LB[dh:a]C[B23:  Black has spoiled White's plan. The play of W 'a' seems to fall into the trap, Black first gets a firm foothold himself and waits for the chance to attack White as a whole.];W[be];B[ce];W[dd]C[After thinking for 6 minutes, Lee Changho elects to play W24 and W 26.];B[bf]LB[ed:a][ec:b][cf:c][de:d][ee:e][df:f][eg:g][ef:h][ff:i][ae:j][dg:k][fg:l][ge:m][gd:n][fe:o][fd:p][hf:q]C[B27 is very solid, around the upper left area, a fight has been brewing, for example, W 'a', B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f', W 'g', B 'h', W 'i', B 'j', W 'k', B 24, W 'l', B 'm', W 'n', B 'o', W 'p' and B 'q', this will lead to a fight in which both sides have some misgivings (see var a).]

(;W[de];B[cf];W[fd]TR[be]C[W28 and W30: White selects a simple play, but White must find a way to retrieve the loss of the marked stone.];B[ec]LB[fe:a][eg:b][id:c]C[B31 is a very solid move, Lee Sedol's attack is fast and sharp, which gave us a deep impression in the game 1, after making himself thick, Lee Sedol can deliver the fatal attack on his opponents with the force of a thunderbolt. Right now White is relatively painful, it is hard to settle the shape in the upper left, the normal play is W 'a' and B 'b', but this leaves White the striking move at 'c'. It is said that recently Lee Sedol has studied a lot of Lee Changho's games, Cho Hunhyun also commented that Lee Sedol is the most possible player that can beat Lee Changho.
];W[fe];B[eg]TR[gf]C[B33 is a good point, this move not only has separated White and also linked up the marked black stone. Through 33, it seems Lee Changho's opening is not successful.];W[kq]LB[qi:a]C[W34 is the biggest point on the board, after W34, Black's extension around 'a' becomes imperative.]
;B[qj]LB[od:a][qf:b]C[After B35, White must invade Black's moyo in the upper right, allowing Black to form a big territory is intolerable for White.];W[hh]C[W36: White seeks some chances to fight in the center.];B[hf]LB[ig:a][ie:b]C[B37 is important, if Black makes the knight's move at 'a', then White will double up at 'b', Black is hard to continue.];W[ie];B[if];W[jf];B[jg]C[B41 is a strong move.]
;W[kf];B[ih];W[hj];B[kg];W[mf]C[W46: White takes the opportunity to encroach Black's territory on the right side.];B[ik]LB[jo:a][gp:b]C[B47: Black starts to attack White in the center, this is also the price White has to pay, B47 is a direct attack, the usual play may be the cap move of B 'a' or the shoulder hit of B 'b', after having more stones on the lower side, then Black initiates the attack.];W[ij];B[jj];W[ji];B[ii]
;W[jk];B[kj];W[il];B[kk];W[hk]C[After making the ponnuki, White is not difficult to handle.];B[jm]C[Jiang Zhujiu 9p and Rui Naiwei 9p, who gather together with some other pros in the study room, think Black has played too fast in this period.];W[in]C[Pros in the study room think that Black has no follow-up tactic, Lee Changho has scored in the center fight.

;W[mq];B[km];W[kn];B[ln];W[lm]C[The cut of W68 is very intense.];B[mm];W[ll];B[kl];W[lo];B[mn];W[mo];B[im]C[After Black pushes with B75, the fight in the center becomes white-hot.]
;W[hm]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.];B[hn];W[gm];B[mp];W[no];B[np]LB[ho:a][nq:b][ir:c][iq:d][jr:e][pq:f][qq:g][op:h][po:i][qr:j]C[After B81, White sinks into a deep meditation. Next if W 'a', B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f', W 'g', B 'h', W 'i' and B 'j', it will lead to a ko fight, Black is easier to tackle the situation (see var a). The opinion from the study room is that Lee Changho is not successful in the fight starting from the cut of W68, now White is caught in a dilemma.]

(;W[ml]C[After White presses with 82, in the center it will lead to a more complicated fight. So far, Lee Changho has used 1 hour and 35 minutes, Lee Sedol 1 hour and 25 minutes.];B[nm]C[B83: Black sticks his head out with a bad shape (empty triangle), Lee Sedol has already made his decision to fight to the end with Lee Changho.];W[ho];B[pq];W[qq];B[op];W[pr];B[on];W[oq];B[ko]C[B91: Black has captured White's three key stones.];W[lj];B[ki]
;W[ok]C[Considering that the two black groups are not completely alive, White pulls out his lonely stones in the center, the fight will be very complicated, the outcome of the game is hard to guess];B[gp]LB[jq:a]C[B95: Black can turn at 'a' to settle the lower group, B95 is an unusual tactic, securing Black himself and also aiming to make troubles for White, Lee Sedol seeks a much higher efficiency.];W[gn];B[jq];W[ir];B[nq];W[nr];B[kr];W[lr];B[ls];W[mr]
;B[hp]LB[ol:a][pk:b][nk:c]C[White exerts more pressure on Black, Black has to seek life, the focal point is that Black aims to live in sente with the maneuver of B 'a', W 'b' and B 'c', but if White strikes first in the upper right, the territory balance between both sides will be broken.];W[fp];B[nl]C[How White will play next is a puzzle, it seems Black is a little initiative, Lee 3p drinks one cup of ice water.];W[nk];B[pn];W[qk]LB[qm:a][rn:b][mh:c][mj:d][ol:e][pj:f][qi:g]C[After W110, the sequence of B 'a', W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 'e', W 'f' and B 'g' is the variation from the study room to settle the shape in the upper right (see var a), this area is the biggest unknown factor on the board.]
