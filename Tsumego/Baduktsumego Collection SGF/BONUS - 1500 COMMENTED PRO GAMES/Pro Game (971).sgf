Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[qk];W[mq]C[W6 is a play to counter the "Chinese Opening", it is relatively popular recently.]
;B[po];W[jq]C[As for the result up to W8, White gets to make two-space extension on the third line, which is relatively substantial.];B[fc];W[hc];B[cc];W[dc];B[cd];W[de];B[db];W[eb];B[cb];W[ec];B[cf]
;W[kc];B[cn];W[fp];B[bp];W[cq];B[dl];W[qf];B[qh];W[eg];B[qe];W[nc];B[pf];W[mn]C[Through W32, the moves from both sides are quite normal.]
;B[jo];W[hp];B[ob]LB[fl:a]C[B35 is over territory-oriented, jumping at 'a' is better, and Black can consider not to exchange B33 and W34 at this time.];W[fl];B[lm];W[ln];B[km];W[on];B[qm];W[kj]C[W42 is a good move! Its correlation with the upper side is spectacular. White can fight.];B[mm]
;W[oo];B[op];W[pl];B[ql];W[nk];B[il];W[ij];B[kp];W[lr];B[kq];W[kr];B[mj]C[B55 killing out is inevitable.];W[pn]LB[mk:a]C[W56: If White cuts by pushing at 'a', it would lead to a very complicated fight.]
;B[mp]C[W56 is a "forcing move", Black counterattacks alertly with B57, sacrificing some territory but obtaining the initiative for the whole game. Its alertness is worth praising.];W[qo];B[nq];W[pj];B[qj];W[no];B[np];W[rq];B[rr];W[rp];B[qq];W[sr];B[rs]
;W[nj];B[lj];W[pg];B[ni]C[When White plays the hane of W72, Black takes tenuki again with B73, Black is very brave, but it is still a complicated fight.];W[oi];B[pk];W[nl];B[nh];W[of];B[pi];W[oh];B[oj];W[lk]
;B[ng];W[ll];B[me]LB[pe:a][og:b]C[B85 is an inexplicable mistake, this may be because it is a fast game. Black clearly should first connect at 'a', after W 'b', then Black makes the knight's move of B85, White is difficult to connect. This would make a big difference from the real game.];W[pe];B[qd];W[od]C[W88: White connects this way, Black incurs a big defeat.];B[ki];W[jk];B[nb];W[mc]
;B[ji];W[in];B[jp];W[iq];B[ho];W[jl];B[kn];W[rg]LB[je:a]C[W100: White should first make the knight's move at 'a', this way White could control the situation very easily. 'a' is a obviously vital point, White must have thought that W100 must be sente.];B[ne];W[oe];B[oc];W[nd]
;B[je];W[qb]LB[rc:a][mb:b]C[With the sequence following W106, White ends in gote again. With W106 White should strike at 'a' or turn at 'b', they are all sente. White is fortunate that he has a big lead earlier, the game is still to White's advantage.];B[rc];W[rb];B[re];W[rf];B[sb];W[ri];B[rh];W[sh];B[ok]
;W[mb];B[ol];W[nm];B[cg];W[bq]C[W120 is calm, it is obvious that White already has calculated the situation precisely.];B[ii]LB[dj:a]C[B121 is a questionable move, the original move is to enclose the territory at 'a'.];W[im]C[W122 is sente and White's privilege, this way the value of B121 is not big.];B[nr];W[he]C[W124 reinforcing is a declaration of victory.];B[jc]C[B125 is a mistake in fast games.]
;W[jd];B[ke];W[id]C[Through W128, Black clearly incurs loss, afterwards the play already has nothing to do with the outcome of this game.];B[gk]C[With the sequence following B129 Black rather dies in glory than lives in dishonor.];W[fk];B[gj];W[gl];B[hk];W[hi];B[ej];W[fj];B[gi]
;W[hh];B[fi];W[ek];B[di];W[dj];B[ei];W[dk];B[hm];W[hj];B[ik];W[jj];B[fn];W[cl]
;B[cm];W[ci];B[fg];W[bl];B[hf];W[gg];B[gf];W[ff];B[hg];W[gh];B[bi];W[fh];B[kl]
;W[kk]C[Through W164, Black on the left side already has no tactic. No matter what happens, either White makes life locally or White crosscuts Black, Black is at least two liberties short in the capturing race.])
