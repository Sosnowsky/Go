Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[pd]C[On 4/7, in the final game 2 of 18th Kisung, Park YuongHoon 9p defeated Choi Cheolhan 9p by 3.5 points, blanked Choi Cheolhan by 2:0 and successfully defended his title.];W[dd];B[pp];W[dp];B[pj]C[The three-star opening is rarely seen nowadays.]
;W[nc];B[pf];W[pb];B[jp];W[hq];B[ho];W[fq];B[pn];W[qc]C[White elects to take territory.];B[me];W[jk]C[W16 destroying Black's moyo is the vital point, Black is relatively difficult to handle.];B[iq]C[B17: Black first strengthens himself, but it is already half step late.]
;W[hp];B[io];W[hk]C[W20 is overly steady. If White were Cho Chikun, he will either take tenuki or jump inside. However, Park YuongHoon is leading 1:0 in the series and not in a hurry.];B[mc]C[B21: Black attaches down to seek thread.];W[md]C[White counterattacks with W22.];B[nd];W[ld];B[oc];W[nb];B[ob]LB[ne:a]C[When B27, with W28 White can cut and capture B15 in a ladder, which is a light and nimble play.]
;W[oa];B[mb];W[na]C[In the real game, a fierce fight can't be avoided.];B[kc];W[re];B[rf];W[qe];B[qf];W[kd];B[jc];W[jd];B[ic];W[pe]
;B[oe];W[of]C[W42: White cuts and seeks to make life in sente.];B[lf]LB[og:a]C[B43: If Black plays atari at 'a', the variations will be complicated.];W[og]C[After White extends with W44, White already makes life in corner, and White can fight.];B[ph];W[id]LB[jf:a][gc:b]TR[of][og]C[But W46 is overly tenacious, White can consider to jump to 'a', sacrificing W42 and W44 the two marked stones, this way White can grab the excellent point at 'b'.]

;W[ke];B[se];W[qd];B[jf];W[kf];B[jg];W[kg];B[gf];W[mg];B[jh]C[In the real game, it forms an exchange, Black is thick on the board, but how to control is a difficult problem.];W[cg];B[fk]LB[lk:a]C[As to the cap of B71, White should jump in at 'a'.]
;W[gm]C[In this game, White plays too freely.];B[fn];W[el];B[cp]C[The attachment of B75 is common tactic.];W[co];B[do];W[cq];B[ep]LB[bp:a]C[When Black plays atari with B79, White certainly should take at 'a'.];W[dq];B[dn];W[ek]
;B[bp]C[In the game, Black is able to create many more threads to take advantage.];W[bn];B[cm];W[bm];B[bl];W[cl];B[ck];W[dl];B[bj];W[bo];B[dh];W[fj];B[dg]
;W[ce];B[im]C[B97: Black takes chance to enclose territory. Black is very hopeful to win the game.];W[al];B[bk];W[kh];B[ji];W[kl];B[lm];W[ll];B[mm];W[qq];B[pq];W[rp]C[W106 and W108 leave White the tactic of making life in the corner.]
;B[ml]C[But the turn of B109 is a very bold move.];W[rn]C[It forces White to reinforce with W110.];B[ki]C[By thickness with W111, Black wants to kill White's big dragon strongly.];W[mi];B[bq];W[br];B[il];W[ik];B[pr];W[rl];B[mj];W[dj]LB[fi:a][gi:b][ii:c]C[The diagonal of W120 is mistake, White didn't expect B 'a' is working! White should make diagonal at 'b', next attach at 'c' to make life. Now Black can't squeeze at 'a', this way White will win the game.]
;B[ch];W[ei];B[cf];W[eb];B[fi];W[jn];B[hm];W[km];B[gj]C[In the game, it forms a ko fight, White is not good.];W[gk];B[ej];W[lj];B[lk]
;W[fj];B[lh];W[lg];B[ej];W[kk];B[mk];W[fj];B[ko]LB[pa:a]C[B141 is inexplicable, Black certainly should continue the ko fight by playing ko threat at 'a'.];W[gi];B[fh];W[fl]C[Black perhaps overlooks White can take inside with W144.]
;B[be];W[bd];B[qo];W[ro];B[hi];W[fm]C[Then White creates eye with W150, making life with one move.];B[gp]C[Seeing the dragon is alive, Black sighs!];W[li];B[qm];W[rm];B[eq];W[er]
