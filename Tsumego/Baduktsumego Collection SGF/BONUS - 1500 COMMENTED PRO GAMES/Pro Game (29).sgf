Copyright by gogameworld.com and weiqi.tom.com.];B[qd];W[dd];B[pq];W[oc]C[W4 directly approaching the corner is a very popular play in Korea in recent years.];B[dp]
;W[po]C[Through W6, it is a fight-oriented opening, this kind of opening appears very frequently in the games among Lee Sedol, Lee Changho and Choi Cheolhan.];B[pe]C[B7 is a steady move.];W[md]C[W8 seems to indicate the fight that is going to come very early on.];B[qm];W[qq];B[qp];W[pp];B[qo];W[qn];B[pn];W[rn];B[rq]
;W[qr];B[ro];W[rm]C[Black elects the joseki from B11 to W20, I feel it is a little questionable, because White is favorable in the ladder, White can turn with W20, this way Black's playing direction is obviously not right.];B[oq];W[np];B[rr];W[ql];B[pm];W[pl];B[nm];W[op];B[ol];W[pj]
;B[qh];W[ok];B[nk];W[nj];B[mk];W[so];B[rp]C[Through B37, the sequence is inevitable from both sides.];W[mm]C[W38 is the vital point, Lee Sedol will never miss this kind of vital points.

Ma Xiaochun 9p: The play from B29 to B35 is questionable, White gets to destroy Black's shape by W38, Black is no good.];B[nn];W[mn];B[mj];W[ni]
;B[mi];W[mh];B[lh];W[mg];B[lg];W[on];B[om];W[mf];B[jp];W[km];B[jj]LB[jh:a]C[Ma Xiaochun 9p: B53, Black is confused, jumping at 'a' is perhaps better.];W[im]C[The sequence up to W54 is also one way street.]
;B[lp];W[nq];B[pr];W[or];B[qs];W[no];B[nl];W[lo];B[gp]C[The sequence from B55 to B63 seems also inevitable.];W[jh]C[W64: White seeks the tempo of playing.];B[ji]C[Ma Xiaochun 9p: B65, Black is painful.];W[ih]
;B[hj];W[fm]C[Through W68, White attacks Black and also tries to escape himself, so far White is favorable.];B[kf];W[if];B[kd];W[id];B[fj];W[dm]LB[lf:a]C[Ma Xiaochun 9p: Through W74, they attack either other, both sides have no certainty of success, but Black has the weak squeezing point at 'a', Black is unreasonable.];B[ck]LB[dj:a]C[Ma Xiaochun 9p: B75, Black is hasty, for Black to jump at 'a' is the original move.]
;W[kk]LB[lf:a][ke:b]C[W76 is a move that gives very much food for thought, and it is a very profound move, I feel it also shows Lee Sedol's style. This move itself is a gote move, but it greatly threatens Black's eye shape and also reduces Black's liberties, strengthens himself and also aims at the tactic of squeezing at 'a' then playing the wedge at 'b', it can be said that this move is one stone for many purposes, I personally think it is a good move.];B[le];W[of]LB[qg:a]C[Black has no other choice but to strengthen the cut in sente with B77, after W78, the tactic of attaching at 'a' becomes effective.];B[cf];W[dh]LB[cd:a]C[The counterattack of W80 is inevitable, since Black's whole big dragon is still not alive, White is definitely reluctant to descend at 'a'.];B[hg];W[hh]
;B[gh];W[gg]C[When B81, W82 and W84 are also related counterattacks.];B[fh];W[hi]C[Since White has the good turn and bump of W86, Black seems to sink into a difficult situation.];B[ik];W[gi];B[fi];W[gj];B[gk];W[fk];B[gl];W[fl]LB[ek:a][fg:b][gf:c][gm:d][dj:e]C[After Black extends with B93, with W94, White can also consider to extend at 'a', Black can only play atari at 'b', next W 'c', B 'd' and W 'e', this way White on the right is hard to be killed, Black would be still in a bitter battle.]
;B[gm];W[gn]C[In the real game, White elects a more fierce play with W94 and W96, obviously Lee Sedol has calculated the fight over here, Lee Sedol's style is just like this, only if he feels he already has calculated precisely, he definitely will elect the most relentless play.];B[hn];W[hm];B[fn];W[go];B[fo];W[ho];B[il];W[ej];B[jn]LB[io:a][in:b][hp:c]C[B105: if Black elects to atari at 'a', next W 'b', B 'c' and W97, although Black is very happy with the wrapping atari, but because Black's big dragon at the top is still not alive, Black can't play this variation.

Ma Xiaochun 9p: B105 is miscalculation, Black can only wrap up and atari at 'a', however Black is also not favorable in the capturing race, in the real game, with the sequence from W108 to W118, Black can't kill White cleanly, Black is already in a losing situation.]
;W[jm];B[in];W[hp];B[gq];W[jo];B[io];W[ip];B[ko];W[kn];B[jo];W[jq];B[kp];W[hr]C[The sequence from W110 to W118 is inevitable.]
;B[kr]LB[gr:a][jr:b][kq:c][hq:d][eq:e]C[B119: Black can't block at 'a', otherwise after White descends at 'a', the game will be over immediately.

Ma Xiaochun 9p: If Black blocks at 'c', then after White connects at 'd', White's striking move at 'e' will be effective. ];W[gr];B[jr]LB[fr:a][hq:b]C[Through B121, the variation is also inevitable.

Ma Xiaochun 9p: B121, if Black blocks at 'a', then White will connect at 'b', Black is no good either. In the real game, it forms a ko fight, because White has many local ko threats, Black can't win this ko fight, so far the game is already over.]
(;W[fp];B[fq];W[fr]LB[ir:a][eq:b][ll:c][kj:d][lq:e][kq:f][lr:g]C[W122 and B124 are good moves, the common feeling is, with W122 White plays at 123 instead, next B122, W 'a', B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f' and W 'g', this way Black is no good either, the important point is that White's big dragon on the right side is already alive, then it doesn't matter even if White sacrifices the ko at the bottom (see var a). White's play in the real game seems better .];B[eq];W[ir]LB[er:a][ll:b][kj:c][lq:d][kq:e][lr:f][mr:g][dr:h][cr:i]C[Through B126, if Black blocks at 'a', after W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 'e' and W 'f', it will lead to a ko fight, this way White is much better than earlier, Black will incur a big defeat right away (see var a), so Black can't block at 'a'. If Black jumps to 'g', then W 'b', B 'c', W 'a', B 'h' and W 'i', Black is no good either (see var b), therefore I feel we now can only concentrate on the game 2 :-)

After this move, it is time for noon break.]

(;B[er];W[lr]LB[ll:a][kj:b]C[W128: White should first exchange W 'a' with B 'b', the exchange should be doable.];B[mr];W[lq];B[kq];W[mq];B[iq];W[hq];B[fs];W[ks];B[is]
;W[mp]LB[ll:a][kj:b]C[Through W138, although it is still a ko fight, but White doesn't have the exchange of W 'a' and B 'b', White has to win the ko fight at the bottom, comparing to the variation described earlier, it makes a huge difference, however even like this, the situation is still to White's advantage.];B[fg];W[gf];B[ff];W[en];B[eo];W[do];B[ep];W[co];B[gs]LB[cp:a]C[B147 starting the ko is a little hasty, now the timing is not ripe, although Black's situation is not good in the game, but with B147 Black should block at 'a' to deal with White.]
;W[jq];B[ge];W[hf];B[iq];W[hl];B[hk];W[jq];B[jg];W[js];B[ig]C[Since there is no other choice, Black has to play the ko threats of B155 and B157, they are clearly small, so far the game for Black is as good as lost.];W[cq]LB[bq:a]C[W158: Perhaps for White to make the knight's move at 'a' is a little better, but it already has nothing to do with the outcome of this game.]
