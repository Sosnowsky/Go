In the game, B31 striking the corner is light and nimble.]
;W[ce]C[W32 hanging down from here is inevitable.];B[ec];W[gc];B[dc];W[ge]C[Through W36, the situation is about even.];B[qc];W[ld];B[lf]LB[kd:a][ok:b][me:c][qm:d]C[Black very hesitates to play B37 and the cap of B39, this way later on Black can attach down at 'a'. However, in the real game, after W 'b', Black is not easy to play. With B37 if Black directly makes the knight's move at 'c', White will make the diagonal at 37, next Black blocks, White will invade at 'd', this will become another game.]
