In the first four games, the series is tied at 2:2, after reguessing the stones, Ma Xiaochun takes Black.];W[dp]C[White is Chang Hao 9P];B[qp];W[dc];B[oq]C[The star and worry-free conrer opening of B1 to B5 is Ma Xiaochun's weapon for guarding the "family property", he always adopts it in the crucial games.]
;W[qj];B[de]LB[ql:a][qf:b][nd:c][oj:d][ce:e][dh:f]C[In one of past games beween Ma and Chang, B7 was played as the forcing move at 'a', followed by W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 'e' and W 'f', Chang Hao won that game.];W[ce];B[dd]LB[cf:a][cd:b][dg:c][fc:d][ck:e]C[The variation of B9 at 'a', followed by W 'b', B 'c', W 'd' and B 'e' is also playable. In this Mingren series, Ma and Chang set out a contest on the "large avalanche" joseki, both sides have gains and losses.]
;W[cd];B[ec];W[cc]LB[cf:a]C[W12 avoids the "large avalanche" joseki because of mental factor, in game 3 and 4 of this series, both sides paid a dear price on this joseki, the reluctance of taking more risk in the decisive game is understandable.];B[df];W[cg]C[The position up to 14 is a common joseki.];B[qh]C[The checking direction of B15 is seldom seen.];W[qm];B[fd]C[B17 is solid.];W[kc];B[ic]
;W[nc];B[ob]C[B21 encloses the corner territory at the maximum limit.];W[id];B[hc];W[nb];B[oc];W[ne];B[pf]C[For the result up to 27, Black can be satisfied.];W[jc];B[je];W[ie]C[The exchange of B29 and W30 seems unneccesary.];B[fq]C[B31 first approaching the corner is the proper move, if Black continues to respond at the top, Black may come away with gote.]
;W[dn];B[dr];W[cq];B[iq]C[Through 35, Black embraces the territory-oriented strategy.];W[dg]C[W36 seeks to expand his moyo and also aims to pound Black's thinness in the upper left.];B[cl]C[The invasion of B37 is very severe.];W[cm]C[W38 is the expedient measure of obtaining sente.];B[dl];W[gb]C[W40 is a planned relentless move of Chang Hao.];B[if]C[B41 is a good move for getting out of trouble.]
;W[gc];B[gd];W[jd];B[db];W[hd];B[cb];W[cf];B[fg]C[Through 49, though White has some gains in territory, but Ma Xiaochun still maintains the efficiency of playing first as black.];W[ef];B[ff];W[ee];B[ed];W[eg]C[The sequence of W50 to W54 wants to keep the priviledge of attacking Black in the upper left.]
;B[hg];W[dj];B[fl];W[fj];B[dm];W[cn];B[fn]C[Through 61, the potential for Black to acquire territory at the bottom is also not small.];W[eq]C[W62 is in good order.];B[fr]C[B63 has no choice but to give way.];W[jp]C[W64 starts the reduction.];B[jq]
;W[er];B[es];W[fp];B[gp];W[go];B[fo];W[ep];B[hp];W[gq]C[W74 is alert.];B[gr]LB[hq:a][cr:b]C[If B75 at 'a', then W 'b' becomes sente, Black is not satisfied.]
;W[ho];B[hm];W[kp];B[hj]C[B77 and B79 are solid.];W[np];B[pn];W[nq];B[or]C[Through 83, Black becomes very thick, How White can handle his two groups is the key for the game.];W[pm];B[on];W[qn];B[qo]
;W[op];B[pp];W[nm]C[The play of W90 is bold and resolute, but it also takes a big risk.];B[nn];W[mn]
(;B[mo]LB[om:a][ol:b][mm:c][nl:d][ln:e][km:f][nr:g]C[The simple hane move of B93 is appropriate, if Black pushes through at 'a', then W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 'e', W 93, and B 'f' (see var a), later White's blocking move at 'g' is kind of sente, for White to live at the bottom is not a problem.];W[om];B[ln];W[mm];B[lp]C[After B97, both sides have no way to back down.];W[no]
;B[lq]LB[po:a]C[B99 is a steady and safe play, if B99 at 'a', it will lead to a complicated variation, Black has no certainty of success.];W[po];B[km]C[Through 101, an exchange results. Black in the center becomes stronger, Black also has gained some territory and should be satisfied.];W[qr]C[W102 is a good sequence play.];B[nr];W[mr];B[pr];W[mq];B[lr];W[rq];B[sp]LB[rp:a][sr:b][rs:c]C[B109 is the tesuji for reducing liberties, if Black blocks at 'a', then W 'b', B 'c', W 109 can create a ko.]
;W[ns];B[ps];W[rf]C[W112 is brutal and relentless with the backing that White on both sides are very thick, Black dares not kill White directly.];B[qf];W[rg];B[re];W[rh]C[Through 116, White has gained a big profit.];B[br];W[cr];B[cs];W[bq];B[rp]C[B121 removed the bad aji in the corner and is a big move.]

;B[cj];W[ci];B[dk]C[B135 and B137 are agile.];W[ck];B[rn];W[rm];B[sm];W[jl]C[W142 is ruthless, White obviously still does not give up the idea of attacking Black in the upper left.];B[kl];W[jj];B[kk];W[jk]
;B[jm];W[fb];B[eb];W[bb]C[The moves of W148 and W150, taking tenuki to grab the big endgame and also destroy Black's eye shapes, are game-deciding plays.];B[ba];W[ab];B[kh]C[B153 refuses to yield an inch, the outcome of fighting here will decide the game.];W[gk];B[hk];W[ki];B[li];W[gl]
;B[gm];W[hl];B[gj]TR[jl][bb]C[B161 is a good move, White obviously has overlooked this move.
