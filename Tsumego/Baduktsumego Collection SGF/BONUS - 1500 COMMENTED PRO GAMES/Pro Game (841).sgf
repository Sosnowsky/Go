Translation:GoGameWorld.];B[qd]C[In the game 2 of best-of-3 series of 8th Samsung Cup final, Cho Chikun gets back one game, leaving the suspense until the final decisive game.];W[dd];B[pq];W[po]C[W4: White directly approaches the corner to destroy Korean players' "Mini Chinese" opening, obviously Cho Chikun did some studies on Park YuongHoon.];B[pl]
;W[oq]C[The attachment of W6 is rarely seen nowadays.];B[op];W[pp];B[nq];W[or];B[qq];W[nr]LB[pr:a]C[W12: For White to turn at 'a' is a little better, however the variation is very complicated, perhaps Cho 9p thinks this is not the place to decide the game.];B[oo];W[rp];B[rq];W[qp]
;B[on];W[pr]C[The joseki up to W18 is considered a little unfavorable for White.];B[mq]LB[fc:a]C[B19 can also be reserved, Black can take the empty corner or directly approach at 'a'.];W[dp];B[fc];W[od];B[pf]LB[of:a]C[B23: If Black pincers W22, White will jump to 'a', it appears Black drives White into his own moyo, Black is no good.];W[ld]LB[qc:a][rc:b][pc:c][re:d]C[W24 is the right move. If White attaches the corner at 'a', then B 'b' and W 'c', next Black will not hang at 'd', instead Black will pincer at 24. Because Black can use his thickness this way, White is not favorable in the fight.]
;B[oc]LB[cf:a]C[Although the attachment and retreat with B25 is very substantial in territory, but from the whole board's point of view, Black needs to double-approach at 'a'.];W[nc];B[pc];W[hc];B[nb];W[fd]TR[fc]C[In the game White captures the marked black stone with W28 and W30, White can be satisfied.
];B[cj];W[ec];B[cg]LB[cn:a][fq:b][cq:c][cp:d][bp:e][bo:f][br:g][ro:h]C[The two-space extension of B33 is over-comfortable! Black should approach the corner at 'a', then W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 'e', W 'f' and B 'g', initiating a ko fight, this way, Black can use the ko threat at 'h', so Black can adequately fight.]
;W[mr];B[lq];W[qm];B[ql];W[rl]C[White first crawls with W34, then plays the hane and connect with W36 and W38, obtaining a lot of territory, however Black's thickness has not been fully utilized.];B[ro];W[qn];B[rk];W[rm];B[qj];W[mg]C[W44 is a good point.];B[cn]
;W[fq];B[cp];W[cq];B[bq]LB[mc:a]TR[ld][mg]C[B47 and B49 are slow, no matter what Black should atari at 'a'! This way the marked two white stones would appear thin, Black can take the chance to attack White.];W[dq];B[bo]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.];W[mc]C[In the game, after White extends with W52, White's shape becomes perfect! Black's 6.5-point komi already becomes a heavy burden for him.];B[kh]C[B53: Black is already very difficult to continue.]
;W[mi];B[lj];W[iq]C[White again grabs the two-space extension of W56.];B[je];W[mj];B[lk];W[mk];B[ml];W[oh];B[qh];W[ce];B[jc]C[W64 and B65 are both big points, each side gets to play one.]

;W[rr];B[ib]LB[me:a][ke:b][jb:c]C[B93: Black dare not destroy White's eye shape by playing at 'a', because White's diagonal's extension at 'b' is sente, after Black blocks from outside, White can cross over at 'c'.];W[ma];B[ob];W[me]C[After White strengthens with W96 to make life, Black already has no chance of winning.];B[fi];W[dn];B[dm];W[do]
