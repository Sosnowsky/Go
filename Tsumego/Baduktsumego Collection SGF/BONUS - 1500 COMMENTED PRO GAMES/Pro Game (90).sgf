Translation:GoGamdWorld.];B[pd]C[In terms of this game's contents, it is almost a complete defeat for Teacher Rin Kaiho.];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[fq]
;W[cn];B[ip];W[pn];B[ql]C[Through B9, Lee Changho has played this opening quite often recently, he must have done a thorough study on this.];W[pp]LB[op:a]C[W10 seems a little damaging, in terms of direction, for White to press at 'a' targeting at the lower side would be better.];B[op];W[qq];B[qr];W[qp];B[or];W[oo]
;B[np];W[mn];B[pi];W[nc];B[pf];W[qc]LB[pb:a]C[W22: For Black to directly enter the corner at 'a' is better than the knight's move at 'a'.];B[pc];W[pb];B[qd];W[rb];B[rc];W[qb]
;B[cf];W[ch]LB[fc:a]C[W30: In a steady opening, corner's territory is very big, so with W30 for White to protect the corner with the knight's move at 'a' is better. In the game, because Black is very thick on the whole board, the potential for White to expand his left-side moyo is not big.];B[cc];W[cd];B[dc];W[ed];B[bd];W[be];B[bc];W[ce];B[fc];W[dr]
;B[no];W[nn];B[om];W[on];B[lo]C[Although the push of B41 looks crude, but then Black peeps with B43 and forces White to make an inefficient shape, after the jump of B45, B41 is not crude any more. The correlation of these several moves is very brilliant.];W[qm]C[Forming a base with W46 is urgent, if Black plays in this area, White would have to escape with dame moves.];B[rm];W[rl]LB[pl:a][qk:b][rn:c][sl:d]C[The play of W48 is not to White's advantage, White should play the hane at 'a', then B 'b' and W 'c', this way White would live completely. In the game after Black takes at 'd', locally White is still not alive.]
;B[rk];W[pl];B[qk];W[rn];B[fo];W[fr];B[eq];W[er];B[gq];W[dk]C[W58: White should play at the star point.];B[ci]C[The attachment of B59 is an excellent move! This is just the weakness of White's shape.];W[dh]
;B[bf];W[bg]C[W62: White has no choice but to allow Black cross over, otherwise Black will make life on the side.];B[ae];W[df];B[lc];W[rd]LB[fd:a]C[W66: White is not careful and precise enough! After Black presses at 'a', White is short of liberties and hard to move, this is too painful! White should first press at 'a'.];B[re];W[sc];B[fd];W[gr];B[hr]
;W[ir];B[hs];W[ko]LB[sm:a]C[Although W72 and W74 are beautiful tesujis, but the timing is not right. White should take one black stone at 'a'.];B[lp];W[ln];B[sl]C[B77 is related to thickness and thinness of both sides, it is a huge move!];W[em];B[gm];W[in]C[With the sequence following W80, although White has ruined Black's side territory, but White has used two moves, White's loss outweighs his gain. So far, although White hasn't made any big mistake, but a lot of small problems accumulate together and it will become fatal, gradually Black is already favorable for the game.];B[fm];W[iq]
;B[hq];W[jp];B[io];W[jo];B[jq];W[ho];B[hp];W[kq];B[jr];W[kr];B[is];W[kp];B[jm]C[B95 hits White's vital point!]
;W[im]C[W96: White can't tolerate if connecting with a dame.];B[ej]C[After White counterattacks with W96, the play of B97 makes White very painful! Normally White should push at the star point, but now this would leave Black a lot of uses for other purpose, and it would become a heavy burden for White when the center White starts to escape.];W[cg]C[W98 is a very damaging move! It is no better than the push at the start point.
];B[km]C[B99 is a strong move! White must be very painful after being cut.];W[il];B[kk];W[ij];B[mk];W[ol];B[jh]C[B105 is a good move, Black's center has expanded dramatically.];W[hi]
;B[fk];W[ig]LB[hg:a]C[W108: White seems to have prepared to fight desperately, clearly enticing Black to push and cut!

Note: In the study room, pros think W108 is questionable, White should jump to 'a', this way the outcome of the game is still hard to judge.];B[ih]LB[ji:a]C[B109: Lee Changho falls into a trap, in fact now Black only needs to strengthen at 'a' to enclose territory, Black would win the game easily.

Note: Pros in the study room think the push and cut of B109 is very severe.];W[hh];B[hg];W[if];B[gg];W[ki]C[After White jumps out with the knight's move of W114, the situation becomes chaotic instantly.];B[kh]
;W[lh]
(;B[kf]LB[li:a][ji:b][lj:c][mi:d][mj:e][nj:f][ni:g][mh:h][nk:i]C[If B117 at 'a', then W 'b', B117, W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f', W 'g', B 'h' and W 'i', Black is no good (see var a).];W[lg];B[jf];W[nj]LB[ji:a][jj:b][li:c][kj:d][mi:e][lj:f][mj:g][lk:h]C[After W120, if Black plays at 'a', then W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 'e', W 'f', B 'g' and W 'h', Black can't be satisfied (see var a).]

(;B[dq]LB[mi:a][mj:b][lj:c][li:d][nk:e][ok:f][oj:g][ni:h][mh:i][oi:j][pj:k][ng:l]C[If B121 at 'a', then W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 'e', W 'f', B 'g', W 'h', B 'i', W 'j', B 'k' and W 'l', Black is no good either (see var b).];W[cq]
;B[cr]C[The atari of B123 is completely unnecessary.];W[bq]LB[mi:a][ie:b]C[W126 is a remorseful losing move! White's corner is about 26 points, but if White captures Black's several stones in the center by playing at 'a', it is also almost 26 points, what the most important is that White makes life the whole group and also obtains sente, this way White can then play at 'b' to fight with Black, this way most likely White would turn the game around.];B[jj]LB[ji:a][ii:b][kj:c][jk:d][ik:e][lk:f][mj:g][jn:h][kn:i][hj:j]C[B125 is a fatal attack, if White answers at 'a', then B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f', W 'g', B 'h', W 'i' and B 'j', White is no good in the capturing race (see var a).]

(;W[fi];B[nk]C[After B125, Black pushes and cuts with B127, White is already in tatters.];W[oj];B[ok];W[ne];B[le];W[oh];B[pk]LB[ei:a][nd:b]C[After B133, Black can push at 'a' or play the wedge at 'b', White sinks into a difficult situation.];W[ge];B[fe]
