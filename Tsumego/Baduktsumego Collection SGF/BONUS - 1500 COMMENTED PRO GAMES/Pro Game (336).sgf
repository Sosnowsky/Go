;W[dn];B[jq]LB[kq:a][op:b][cj:c]C[After the corner-approach of B5, B7 making a three-space extension is a new trend, the usual move is to extend on the side at 'a', in the game, White is left with a good approach move at 'b', then White can first complete his moyo by playing at 'c' while waiting quietly to see how Black will play.];W[cj];B[op];W[qj];B[qk]LB[pj:a]C[Although B9 and B11 is playable, but I can't agree, from the state of mind, with B9 Black should extend at 'a', allowing White to approach in at 9, then consider how to attack.];W[pk];B[ql]
;W[pj];B[qf];W[pq]C[W16 is an asking move.];B[qq]LB[oq:a][qn:b]C[B17: Black has been exploited, if Black blocks at 'a' instead, White will invade at 'b', this would lead to a fierce fight, both sides have no certainty of success.];W[pl];B[qn];W[qm];B[rm];W[pm]C[Through 22, the local fight comes to an end.];B[fc]
;W[df];B[jc]TR[jq]LB[db:a][hc:b]C[B25 and the marked black stone are in the same position, however to make the knight's move at 'a' is steady, because White is thick on the right side, it is always a burden for Black to leave an invasion point at 'b'.];W[rn];B[ro];W[hc];B[ej]C[After the invasion of W28, Black has no choice but to tenuki with B29, because there are no good moves to play at the top.
];W[ek]LB[he:a]C[The attachment of W30 is over conservative, White should jump to 'a' instead, which is an obviously good point, Black already have no good moves left on the left side.];B[fj]
;W[dj];B[fk];W[el];B[fe]LB[cq:a]C[Black jumps out with B35 to get into a fight, which is from the state of mind, however to enter the corner at 'a' is a very enticing point.];W[fg];B[hf];W[ob];B[oc]LB[pc:a][lc:b][kc:c]TR[hc]C[The sequence after B39 is questionable, Black should play at 'a' instead, followed by W 'b' and B 'c', attacking White, this way Black can take the opportunity to capture the marked white stone.]
;W[pb];B[mc];W[qd];B[qe];W[pc];B[od];W[rc];B[db]C[B57: In the game Black ends in gote.];W[nb];B[rd];W[qc];B[md];W[eq]C[After White first extends with W48, then come back to make the diagonal's hit with W52, Black has failed in the opening.]
;B[fp]LB[cq:a][gm:b]C[B53: Black should consider directly enter into the corner at 'a' to probe White, in the game Black just helps White to make a good knight's move with W 'b'.];W[gm];B[cq]C[B55: Black now gets into the corner, it is already one step slow.];W[er];B[co];W[do];B[cn]LB[br:a][bp:b]C[B59 is unreasonable! Black should make life by playing at 'a' instead, however White can play the clamp at 'b', Black's shape is still constricted.];W[cp]
;B[bp];W[br]C[After White pushes with W60, White happily delivers the killing move of W62.];B[bk];W[bn]LB[cc:a][eh:b]C[Next, W64 is again a good move! Black has no choice but to live where is still open with the diagonal's extension at 'a' and the jump at 'b', Black is already losing.];B[bj];W[cm];B[ch];W[dh];B[cg];W[dg]
;B[ci];W[di];B[be];W[hh];B[lp]LB[jg:a]C[As to the knight's move of W75, Black reinforces with B75, which seems a declaration of victory, Black certainly should expand with the knight's move at 'a'.];W[ie];B[if];W[kc]C[After the knight of W76, the attachment of W78 is a good move, Black is forced to give way and on the way to an overwhelming defeat !];B[jd];W[je];B[kd]
;W[jf];B[hd];W[he];B[gd];W[jm]C[W86: Black expands gradually and freely, Black is already losing.];B[ki];W[jh];B[mh];W[mn];B[no];W[pg];B[ng];W[ji]C[W88 and W94: In a favorable situation, White elects to play the most steady way of settling the shape.]
;B[kj];W[jj];B[kk];W[hq];B[hp];W[gr];B[ip];W[in];B[rk];W[nn];B[fr];W[fs];B[gf]LB[cc:a]C[With B97 and B107, Black pounds White's thinness while in an unfavorable situation, the proper move for B107 is to crossover with the diagonal's extension at 'a', however, this way Black still would lose the game by a narrow margin. Facing with Lee Changho's wonderful endgame skill, An Choyoung is already losing confidence.]
