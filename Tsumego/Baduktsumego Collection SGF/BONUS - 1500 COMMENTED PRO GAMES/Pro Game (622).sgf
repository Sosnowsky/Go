;B[br];W[er];B[bm];W[bn];B[bl];W[bp];B[fq];W[dl];B[ck]LB[ap:a]C[B27: If Black plays the hane at 'a', it would lead to the recently crazy "large avalanche" joseki, that way the game would be steady and smooth, Lee Sedol who is fight and strength style certainly doesn't like it. The problem is that regarding the variation after B27, most people feel that White is easier to play, does Lee Sedol have some new research?];W[dk];B[cj];W[fr]

;B[qp];W[qk];B[qi];W[on];B[np];W[jr]LB[nc:a]C[W62: White is too early, although for White to destroy Black's territory is not small, but the outside is still very empty and should be more valuable, for example approach the corner at 'a'.];B[ir]C[B63 is a strong move!];W[oq]LB[cs:a]C[W64: If White directly pushes, after Black ataris and wraps up, then play the hane at 'a', there is loophole that Black can use.];B[op]
;W[nq];B[pr];W[kq];B[iq];W[lp];B[lo];W[mp];B[mo];W[lr]LB[db:a]C[W74: Although White can make live cleverly, but in the process Black's outside has also become thicker, what the important is that Black gets to strike first at the top by playing at 'a', the difference is indeed very big!];B[jn];W[im];B[oj]

;B[eb];W[cb];B[gc];W[bg]LB[bb:a]C[W94: If White fails to reinforce, the clamp of B 'a' would be severe.];B[nc]C[After Black defends the corner with B95, Black has built a tremendous moyo on the upper side, White has no clear way of playing.];W[ic];B[kc];W[qc]C[W98 is alert! Before Black's outside becomes thick, White leaves some aji and then handles W96, leaving some room for maneuver.];B[qd];W[pc];B[rd]C[B101: Black is painful, if bumping, clearly Black can make life by a ko fight, but the play in the game is also unconvincing --- can only say that Choi WongYong doesn't play well.]
;W[lb]LB[lc:a][mb:b][kb:c][nb:d]C[W102 is a good tesuji! If Black plays at 'a', White can extend at 'b', B 'c' and W 'd', this way the living corner would be very big!];B[mb]TR[qc]C[After the diagonal of B103, the ingenuity of the marked white stone has been exposed, originally if White directly plays at 102, Black certainly should not answer at 103.];W[hd]C[White elects to play by sacrifice with the sequence after W104, thinking of Black's big dragon on the left side.];B[bb];W[cc]LB[ed:a]C[W106: White can't descend, because Black can attach at 'a', White couldn't seal of Black.]
;B[fe];W[fd];B[gd];W[ge];B[he];W[gf];B[ie];W[ff];B[hc];W[ob]C[W116 is an experienced move!];B[rb]C[B117: Now if Black allows White's corner live, Black's territory on the board would be inadequate.];W[lc]C[B117: But Black elects to kill the corner, the show after W118 has also started. If opponent play well, nobody can do anything about it.]

;B[jc];W[kg];B[jj];W[nf];B[ng]C[B149: Therefore, regardless of his own big dragon's safety, Black makes the last ditch struggle.];W[og];B[nh]C[After W151, there are a lot of moves, but as far as professional players are concerned, already there is no any variation. Lee Sedol elects to better die in glory than live in dishonor, his tenaciousness is lovable.];W[me];B[le];W[ph];B[pf];W[jk]
