;B[mo];W[qr];B[pn]C[This game almost has no opening.];W[pm];B[qn];W[qm];B[ro];W[qo];B[rn];W[rm];B[rp];W[qp];B[om]C[The lower right corner is a big-scale joseki.]
;W[rk];B[qk];W[rl];B[de]C[However, Black plays ladder breaker with B35, Black can fight.];W[ol];B[nm];W[mn];B[ce];W[ln];B[lo];W[kn];B[ko];W[jn]
;B[jo]LB[ed:a]C[Black attaches from behind with B43 and B45 in order to obtain sente, White certainly wouldn't answer again, since B 'a' at top capturing one stone is very big.];W[cd]C[The clamp of W46 is common move.];B[bd];W[ee];B[df];W[bc];B[be];W[ec];B[fd];W[fb]LB[ed:a][bb:b]C[W54: White hopes to live locally, if White connects at 'a', then Black will clamp at 'b', White is painful.]
;B[gb]LB[bb:a][gc:b]C[B55: If Black clamps at 'a', White will take tenuki and play hane at 'b'.];W[eb];B[bb];W[ac];B[cb];W[cc];B[fe]C[The play of B61 is to leave "seki" in the corner.];W[ed];B[ef];W[gq]
;B[pf]C[W64 and B65 are all good points.];W[pc];B[qc];W[mc]LB[ld:a]C[W68 is positive play, of course for White to play at 'a' is more light and nimble.];B[me]C[Black inevitably will attack.];W[ld]C[White has no assurance of success.];B[kf];W[qb];B[rb];W[le]
;B[lf];W[jd];B[jc];W[jf];B[jg];W[if];B[ig];W[hf];B[hc];W[hg];B[ke];W[kd];B[je]
;W[id];B[ie];W[ob];B[qa];W[pa]C[Following W92, it forms a ko fight.];B[pb]C[White's five stones are being separated on the outside, White already incurs loss, the result is not good for White.];W[he];B[hd];W[qb];B[rq];W[rr];B[pb]
;W[mf];B[mg];W[qb];B[db]LB[pb:a][nf:b][ne:c]C[W104: If White answers the ko, Black will take at 'a', if White extends at 'b' next, Black will answer at 'c'.];W[nf]C[Therefore, White elects to extend with W104, it is an asking move.];B[ab];W[ng];B[kg];W[mh]
;B[hh];W[qh]C[W110: White can only play this way in order to have a chance to win.

After this move, it is time for noon break.];B[pb];W[ki];B[ii];W[qb];B[ph]LB[qg:a]C[B115 is strong move. If Black plays at 'a', Black can make life but is very inconvenient. For the whole game, Black is not necessarily favorable.];W[qg];B[pg];W[ra]LB[sc:a]C[From W118 to B135, since Black can make eye at 'a', White is difficult to kill Black.]

;W[pb];B[od];W[nd];B[oj]LB[sc:a]C[If White can't kill White, White's middle territory will be destroyed, White can't win the game.];W[oh]C[Therefore, following W136 White can only kill strongly.];B[mj];W[kh];B[lk];W[jk];B[jl]C[B137 to B141 are good moves. White is still difficult to handle.];W[nk]
;B[nh];W[og];B[mm]C[After Black escapes with B145, ...];W[ml];B[lm];W[ll];B[km];W[kl];B[jm];W[in];B[hm];W[oi];B[ho]LB[kk:a]C[..., since B155 to B165 are all sente, White already can't connect at 'a' to save his seven stones.]

;W[pi]C[In the game, White is forced to make exchange.];B[pj];W[lg];B[jj];W[sq]C[But after the exchange, White has to reinforce with W172 in gote.];B[fk]C[Black is able to enclose big territory with B173, Black is still favorable for the whole game.];W[cl]C[W174: White has to extend this far in order to have a chance to win.];B[fp];W[fq];B[em];W[fn]
;B[en];W[gp];B[ep];W[eo];B[fo];W[go];B[do];W[eq];B[el]C[B175 to B187 are clever moves, surrounding W174 inside Black's thick wall.];W[jr];B[lr];W[bn]C[W190 is game-deciding move.]
;B[bo]C[Lee Sedol is not softhearted even in a favorable situation.];W[cn];B[co];W[bi];B[bk]C[From B195 to B219, it leads to a ko fight.];W[ck];B[an];W[am];B[bj];W[cj];B[bh];W[kr]

;W[eo];B[cm];W[bm];B[an]C[White's ko threat is not enough.];W[pr]LB[or:a][ir:b]C[Since White can only hope to turn with W220 as ko threat, but B 'a' and 'b' are miai, White can't kill Black unconditionally, in the end White fails to overturn the game.];B[al];W[iq];B[or];W[ns];B[ms]
