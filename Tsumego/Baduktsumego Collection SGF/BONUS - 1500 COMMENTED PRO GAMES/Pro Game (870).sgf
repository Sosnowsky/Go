;B[fp];W[qq];B[kp];W[co];B[cn];W[cp];B[dn]C[Through B13, it forms a joseki, White's speed is fast, Black is thick.];W[cg];B[fr];W[ep];B[eo];W[bn];B[bm]
;W[bo]C[After the diagonal of W16, the hane and connection of W18 and W20 are huge, making some defects on Black's outside. If White takes tenuki, Black's strike at 2-2 in the corner is very severe.];B[rq];W[pq];B[ro]C[B21 and B23: Black plays hane then hangs, it is also very big, the sequence up to B27 is inevitable. White seems a little restricted, Black is adequate.];W[mp];B[lq];W[mq];B[pm];W[nc];B[qf];W[jc];B[cc]C[B31 shows Yu Bin's favorite for territory.]

;B[bd];W[ee]LB[dj:A]C[W46 is steady, to make extension at 'A' is more positive.];B[kn];W[ne]C[Through W48, the opening is steady, there are no fights, perhaps this game will be decided in the endgame.];B[pb];W[cl];B[cm];W[el];B[eq];W[dr]C[W54 is very big and worth counter-hane 10 points .];B[ng]
;W[lg];B[mf];W[ke];B[md]C[B59 is a local good move, Black continues to use the same strategy: first take territory then destroy.];W[me];B[nd];W[le];B[mc];W[hm]LB[hk:A][ij:B]C[W64: White feels his territory is not enough, so he elects to expand his moyo at the maximum limit and also aims to attack Black's thinness at the bottom. The common move is to simply enclose at 'A', then Black will play the shoulder-hit at 'B', White can't be satisfied.];B[no]C[The peep of B65 is professional feeling, aiming to enter into the center by tangling with White, White's situation is difficult.]
;W[mo];B[nn];W[mn];B[mm];W[lm];B[ln];W[rr]C[W72: White can only make life inconveniently, Black is very happy to stick the head out with B75! Black is very thick on the board, White is not easy to cultivate the center.];B[sr];W[rs];B[ml];W[pg]C[W76 is a very nimble move, next up to W90, it forms an exchange, White gives up the center and elects to destroy each other's territory, it is a clever choice.];B[pf]
;W[og];B[of];W[nh];B[mh];W[mg];B[nf];W[mi];B[lf];W[lh];B[kf];W[jf];B[kg];W[pi]
;B[mr];W[nr];B[lr];W[np];B[gl]LB[fm:a]C[B95 is a questionable move, Black should separate White at 'a'.];W[jo];B[ko];W[fm]C[W98 is a clever move to connect, Black can only turn the body around, through W106 Black incurs loss locally.];B[bq];W[br];B[ck]
;W[gm];B[dl];W[dk];B[bl];W[dj];B[ns];W[or];B[kh];W[ki];B[ci];W[lb];B[di]C[Following B113, Black settles the shape in sente, it goes back to a close game.];W[ei]
;B[eh];W[fi];B[dg];W[df];B[fh];W[gi];B[mb];W[qg];B[qj];W[pj];B[qk];W[hp];B[kj]
;W[ij]LB[ji:A][lj:B][ik:C]C[W128 again is a nimble move, if White extends at 'A', next B 'b', White connects and B 'C', White is not good.];B[hf];W[he];B[kb];W[kc];B[il];W[hl];B[im];W[gq];B[dp]
;W[in];B[jn];W[ho];B[ik];W[hk];B[jj];W[po];B[qn];W[rg];B[re];W[ka];B[hj];W[gj]
;B[nj];W[ni];B[ge];W[ie];B[em];W[ek];B[fe]LB[iq:a][gr:b][bi:c]C[B157 is an inexplicable losing move! Black should make the knight's move at 'a', next W 'b' and B 'c', Black can win the game by a small margin.];W[eg];B[dh];W[fg]
;B[hg];W[gh];B[bh]C[This game should be a good game for Black, Black's opening is very steady, in the middle game, the situation enters into Yu Bin's good tempo, although incurring a little loss in the exchange, Black simplifies the situation and still can win the game. However, the last miscalculation gives the victory away, it is very regrettable, perhaps Go's enigma just lies in here!];W[ig]C[Yuki Satoshi advances to the fight eighteen, the round 2 will take place on 4/10.])
