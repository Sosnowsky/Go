;B[iq];W[gq];B[qo];W[kq]C[The opening is very steady from both sides, in terms of playing styles, Heyang should more like this opening.];B[cg];W[dg]C[The exchange of B23 and W24 is not really necessary and most likely damaging.];B[en];W[qq];B[pq];W[mq]C[W26 and W28: White seeks tempo of playing, the ko is light to White.];B[mr];W[lr]
;B[mp];W[lp];B[lq];W[ob];B[nc];W[mq];B[ep];W[eq];B[lq];W[dm];B[co];W[mq];B[ek]LB[bk:a][pj:b]C[Black gives up the ko fight with B43, it is slow, Black perhaps feels the strike of W40 is damaging. In fact, W 'a' is not damaging and also is a handy ko threat. With B43 Black should attach at 'b' to continue the ko fight.]
;W[mo];B[lq];W[bk];B[bj];W[mq];B[np];W[cj];B[bl];W[dk];B[ak];W[cl];B[bk];W[ej]C[The tiger of W56 is a good shape.]
;B[ch]C[Although Black's situation is not good, but with the hit of B57 Black loses common sense!];W[bi];B[dh];W[eg];B[ei]C[Black has to play the crude move of B61 and also is forced to escape a very heavy group.];W[fj];B[bf];W[ce];B[fh];W[fd];B[gd];W[ge]TR[bf][cg][ch][dh][ei][fh]C[When W68, Black also can't answer, otherwise Black's six stones are dangerous.]
;B[hh];W[hd];B[gc];W[he];B[ed];W[ee];B[fe];W[ff];B[gp];W[ij]C[Through W78, White is clearly favorable.];B[jh];W[je]LB[kj:a]TR[ic]C[The direction of W80 is wrong, White should jump to 'a'. Black's marked stone already sticks out, White can't play there, now the center is just must-have place!]
;B[ki];W[kk];B[fq];W[fr];B[fp];W[gr];B[jk]C[The crosscut of B87 is the game-deciding move!];W[jj];B[kj];W[ik];B[jl];W[il];B[lk]
;W[ig];B[ih];W[fi]TR[bf][cg][ch][dh][ei]C[From W90 to W96, although White captures five black stones, Black gets to turn around, the difference between both sides instead becomes smaller.];B[rj];W[rk]C[As for the exchange of B97 and W98, it is hard to judge whether it's good or bad.];B[cb];W[fd];B[ec];W[ri]C[W102 reinforcing is a very thick play.]
;B[hq]LB[kl:a]C[After B103, White wants to escape at 'a' to fight with Black, since White is already very thick on the board.];W[ho]C[Although White again captures four stones following W104, but Black becomes thick overall, the situation becomes even closer.];B[jm];W[hp];B[jp];W[jo];B[ko];W[ip];B[jq];W[kp];B[lo]
;W[jr];B[lq];W[kr]C[However, since White's early advantage is too big, White is still slightly favorable.];B[jn];W[io];B[hn];W[hr]C[There aren't much turns in the following endgame, White keeps 1.5 points advantage till the end.];B[nb];W[eh];B[rm];W[rn];B[qn]
