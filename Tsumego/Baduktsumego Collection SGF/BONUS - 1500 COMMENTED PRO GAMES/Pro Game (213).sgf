;W[ce];B[dd];W[cd];B[ec];W[cf];B[do];W[eo];B[df];W[dg];B[en]LB[ep:a][cg:b][cq:c]C[The pressing and hane of B13 and B15 have really taken Black a lot of thought, if Black first hanes at 15 to exchange with W 'a', then press at 13, White may extend at 'b' to avoid the "large avalanche" joseki, however in the game after the pressing move of B13, if White elects to extend at 'b', Black may not hane at 15, instead Black will attach under at 'c'.]
;W[ep];B[cc];W[db];B[bc];W[cb];B[cg];W[ch];B[bb];W[bg]TR[do][en]C[W24 is a novel play, if White proceeds with the normal joseki, because Black already has the marked two stones in position, the result would not be favorable for White.];B[eb];W[dn]C[Although White has incurred a small loss locally, but White gets to cut with W26, White is not bad on the whole board.]
;B[cn]LB[dm:a]C[Black continues to grab territory with the sequence after B27, which fits well with Gu Li's style. Moreover, in the current situation there is no other better play, if Black tenukis to form one worry-free corner, White would extends at 'a', White's configuration on the left side will be too adequate, Black can not be satisfied.];W[dm];B[cm];W[dl];B[cl];W[dk];B[bq];W[kp];B[mq];W[lo];B[mn]LB[pn:a]C[B37 is a shocking move, extending at around 'a' is common.]
;W[np];B[nq];W[op];B[pp];W[po];B[qo];W[pn];B[qn];W[pm];B[qm];W[pl]TR[mn]C[Through the extension of W48, it seems the marked black stone would die quietly, but ...];B[kq]
;W[jq];B[lp]C[B49 and B51 are good moves!];W[mo];B[jr];W[jp];B[ir]TR[mn]C[Black is able to hane and extend with B53 and B55, Black has scored in territory again, if this is the follow-up maneuver of the marked black stone, it is very playable, perhaps only Gu Li can imagine this unique idea.];W[od]C[W56: White is very difficult to decide where to play, in this situation probably only Takemiya Masaki 9p knows where is the best point to play.];B[ld];W[lf]LB[of:a][pf:b][lg:c]C[The cap of W58 is the vital point, if White plays usually at 'a' or 'b', Black would make the two-space extension at 'c' to reduce White's center moyo.]

;W[nf];B[qk]LB[ql:a][qi:b]C[The jump of B73 is unexplainable, it looks like an amateur play, later on White can push at 'a', Black can not block! Black certainly should turn at 'b' to capture the two white stones completely.];W[oh];B[ng];W[mh];B[mg];W[lg];B[nh];W[ni];B[oi];W[mf]
;B[oh];W[nj]LB[mi:a][ql:b]C[W84: If White connects at 'a', White would be thicker, afterwards if White pushes at 'b', Black also couldn't blockade.];B[ig]LB[lh:a]C[Because Black has the maneuver of the atari at 'a', White dares not to attack B85.];W[ql];B[qi];W[ie];B[hf];W[he];B[ff]
;W[ic];B[jf];W[je];B[hp]TR[ld]C[Although White has captured the marked black stone, but Black gets to make the knight's move of B95, White's center big moyo has been destroyed.];W[rm];B[rp];W[pd];B[qe];W[ck];B[bk];W[bj];B[cp]

;B[lh]LB[ok:a][nl:b]C[The atari of B117 is a careless move, simply playing at 'a' is more severe, in the real game Black just helps White to play the net at 'b'.];W[mi];B[ok];W[nl];B[nk];W[mk];B[ml];W[ll];B[mm];W[lk];B[ol]

;W[hh];B[nn]LB[gq:a][ge:b]TR[hf][jf][ig]C[B155: If Black ataris at 'a', Black could capture the four white stones, but after White extends at 'b', White can kill the three marked black stones, Black would be a little disadvantageous in the game. Thus Gu Li plays B155 in order to confuse his opponent.];W[gq]C[The stand of W156 is blameless, after capturing several black stones, White is clearly winning.];B[jo];W[dr];B[jm];W[jl];B[gr]
;W[pk];B[oj];W[qj];B[ri];W[pj];B[sm]LB[fr:a]C[The clamp of B167 is a local tesuji, but White is not fearful, because White can block at 'a' and capture another three black stones in the center, the exchange is favorable to White.];W[rn];B[sk];W[km];B[ko];W[fr]LB[sl:a]C[W172: For White to throw-in at 'a' would be better, this would sacrifice several stones too, but it would make a big difference in ko threats. White has made one mistake after another in the endgame, in the end Black wins the game.]
