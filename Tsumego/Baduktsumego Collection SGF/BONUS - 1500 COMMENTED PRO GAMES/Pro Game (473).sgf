;B[cf];W[fc];B[bd];W[cg];B[dg];W[ch];B[bf];W[cc];B[dh];W[ci];B[de]LB[di:a][cn:b][co:c][dn:d][ck:e]C[B15 does not push at 'a' but makes a tiger move, its main purpose is, if White turns at 'a', then B 'b' approaching the corner, W 'c' making the diagonal contact, B 'd' extending, after White sticking his head out, Black has the room for making two space extension at 'e', it is more active this way.]
;W[dk];B[fq];W[cn]C[W16 and W18 are steady.];B[dr];W[qo]LB[qn:a]C[W20 approaching with the large knight's move at 'a' is more common, in the game after Black's two-space high pincer, locally White has no good moves.];B[pl];W[qj]C[W22 varies out of no alternatives.];B[po];W[qg];B[qp]C[Black can be satisfied with 23 and 25, making two moves in a row to secure the corner.]
;W[nc];B[pf];W[re];B[pi]LB[pg:a][qh:b][md:c]C[The strike at B29 is an overplay, after White counteracts with the attachment of W30, Black is barely enough to fight. The common sequence in this situation is, B29 can press at 'a', followed by W 'b' drawing back and B 'c' diagonal push.];W[pg];B[md];W[oe]C[W32 is an interrelated counter-attack play with W30.];B[nd];W[od]
;B[oc];W[pc];B[ob];W[pb];B[nb];W[of]C[Through the block of W40, White is successful.];B[jc];W[jq]C[W42 can also be considered to split at 'a', leaving the option of two-space extention on either side.]LB[kq:a];B[lq];W[cq];B[hq]
;W[jo];B[ep]C[B47 is very thick.];W[jm]LB[pj:a]C[W48 is slow-paced, it should attach at 'a', thus White is not bad.];B[do];W[co];B[dq];W[cp];B[og]C[The cut at B53 is unreasonable.];W[me]LB[mc:a][lc:b][mb:c][pj:d]C[However, the attachment of W54 is a mistake, thus the exchange of B53 and W54 benefits Black unexpectedly. Instead W54 should escape at 'a', Black can only play at 'b' or atari at 'c', as a result it is impossible for Black to seal off White, White then can play somewhere else, this is the exact problem of B53.]
;B[qi];W[ri];B[pj]C[After B55 and B57, the game has been turned around instantly.];W[qk];B[pk];W[rj];B[ql];W[oo];B[pn];W[lo];B[mq];W[rl];B[rm]
;W[bc];B[ed];W[ec];B[cd];W[dc];B[rh];W[rg];B[le]LB[hc:a]C[The hane of B75 is small, both sides should not play here, B75 should extend at 'a'.];W[mc]C[W76 escaping is a good move, thus White can tenuki.];B[mb];W[hc]
;B[di];W[dj];B[bg];W[bh];B[fi]TR[hc]LB[ef:a]C[After White makes the extension of the marked stone, B79 and 83 can not be omitted, otherwise Black's big group will die after W 'a'.];W[hr]C[White has played exquisitely from W84 to W94, the game becomes very close.];B[gr];W[hp];B[iq];W[ir]
;B[ip];W[io];B[ho];W[jp];B[gp];W[kr];B[lm];W[ln]LB[ll:a]C[W96 is a crude play, and it should attach at 'a'.];B[km];W[jl];B[kn];W[ko]
;B[mm];W[hn]C[White has to make eyes by the sequence following W102.];B[gn];W[hm];B[gm];W[hl]LB[ik:a]C[Through 106, Black still has the manuever of hit at 'a', White is difficult.];B[pa];W[rb];B[qh];W[sh];B[sl]C[Through B111, White is better off.]
;W[ib];B[jb];W[ef];B[ee];W[ff];B[df];W[ge];B[hi];W[ns];B[nr]LB[lr:a][ls:b][or:c]C[B121 should push at 'a', after W 'b' and B 'c', at the bottom White has to make eyes in gote.]
;W[qa]LB[jj:a]C[W122 is the last losing move! it is actually very small, W122 should jump at 'a', then the difference in the game is still not that big.];B[br];W[lr];B[mr];W[ms];B[ls];W[ks];B[os];W[cr];B[cs];W[bq];B[dm]
;W[dn];B[ik];W[jk]LB[il:a]C[When B135 strikes, White can only connect at 'a', probably White feels it so passive that he attaches at 136 instead.];B[jn];W[in];B[il];W[ij];B[hk];W[im];B[gk];W[fl];B[gl]C[After Black takes away one eye with sente, White is forced to exchange W144 with B145 to rescue the big group by sacrificing, however, as a result Black establishes himself in an invincible position.]
