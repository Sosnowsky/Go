(;SZ[19]EV[4th Chunlan Cup quarter-final]DT[2002-12-26]KM[7.5]PC[Shengzhen, China]PB[Chang Hao]BR[9p]PW[Cho U]WR[7p]C[Copyright by gogameworld.com and weiqi.tom.com.]RE[B+R];B[pd]C[Chang Hao 9P of China is black.];W[dd]C[Chang Hsu 7P of Japan is white.];B[pq];W[dp];B[fq]
;W[hq];B[cf];W[fc];B[cn]C[The opening up to 9 is very popular recently.];W[fp];B[cq];W[cp];B[dq];W[ep];B[fr];W[bp];B[bq]LB[gq:a]C[B17 is the most usual play in response to W16, besides, Black can also play at 'a'  to obtain sente.]
;W[cl]LB[dm:a][gp:b]C[W18 is not often seen,  the capping move at 'a' is common, in the game Black's hane move at 'b' is very severe.];B[bd];W[ch];B[cc];W[df];B[ce];W[dg];B[gp]C[As expected, B25 initiates the fight over here.];W[gq];B[go]
;W[jp];B[en];W[bn]LB[cm:a]C[The exchange of 29 for 30 is worth study, there may have some other variations, in the study room, Hua Yigang 8p suggests butting at 'a',  anyway,  the play in the game loses the possibility of punishing W18.];B[mp]LB[gm:a]C[(In postgame analysis, Chang Hao says B31 is his proud move, strengthening at 'a' is common.)];W[gr];B[eq];W[jn];B[gm]LB[bm:a]C[Black reinforces himself, consequently Black's hane at 'a' is now possible.]
;W[aq];B[ar];W[ap];B[bs]C[White's hane and connection on the first line can not be omitted.];W[ik]LB[nc:a]C[The large knight capping at W40 is of great momentum but may come to nothing. (Chang Hao suggests W40 should approach the corner at 'a', the play in the game is a losing move.)];B[cm];W[bm];B[dl];W[dk];B[ck];W[bl]
;B[el];W[dj];B[gk]C[In response, Black selects the steadiest way of living.];W[hn]C[White still wants to continue taking profit by sente move.];B[hm]C[After thorough consideration, Black is finally driven beyond forbearance, B51 starts counter-attack.];W[gn];B[in];W[io];B[im];W[fn];B[fm];W[jm]
;B[fo];W[ho];B[eo]C[Through 61, the local confrontation comes to an end, Black is basically alive and thick across the board,  Black can be satisfied. ];W[nc];B[qf];W[db]C[From the result, no matter what happens, W64 is questionable, and over here White unexpectedly ends in gote. (As Chang Hao says, W64 is a fatal mistake)];B[dc];W[ec];B[de];W[ee]LB[bb:a][cb:b][ca:c][eb:d][ea:e]C[Although there leaves a ko, but White's burden is too heavy, furthermore Black is thick everywhere, and it is not easy for White to find ko threats, so this ko has no big impact on Black. (A ko results with the sequence of W 'a', B 'b', W 'c', B 'd' and W 'e')]
;B[lc]C[Black gets to play here first with a good tempo.];W[pc];B[qc];W[qb];B[oc];W[pb];B[ob];W[od];B[nb];W[qd];B[pe];W[rd];B[ne]
;W[qo]C[W82 is an obvious big point.];B[pl];W[oo];B[op];W[pp];B[oq];W[qq];B[qr];W[rq];B[kq];W[jq];B[kr];W[mo]

;B[ic]C[B121 is the last big point, Black can grab this point and is successful in the overall fighting.];W[id];B[jd];W[jc]C[White crosscuts to create complications, it is a game-deciding move.];B[je];W[kc]C[W126 seems unreasonable.];B[ib]C[B127 is certain, over here Black is unyielding.];W[kd];B[ke];W[ld];B[le]
;W[mc];B[lb]C[Through 133, White comes to a dead end and has to concede defeat. Chang Hao gets into the semi-final.])
