Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[pd];W[dd]C[The fight starts from the opening and becomes chaotic to the end, both sides made some mistakes in the endgame.];B[qp]C[Yamashita misses a lot of good chances, his loss is really a pity.];W[dq]C[It seems Cho Chikun will take down this Judan title again.]
;B[do];W[op];B[oq]C[As to the corner-approaching of W6, Cho Chikun (Black), who ardently loves territory, most likely will choose to attach with B7.];W[nq];B[pq];W[dl];B[gp];W[eo];B[en];W[fo];B[dp];W[fq];B[cq]
;W[eq];B[fn];W[go];B[cr];W[np]LB[qn:a]C[W22: If White can exchange with B 'a', it will definitely help the fight on the left side.];B[el]C[Therefore, the counterattack of B23 is good play.];W[ek];B[fl];W[cl];B[ip]C[B27: Black gets to attack first, Cho Chikun's fighting spirit is vivid on the board.];W[io]LB[ir:a]C[W28: White sticks head very painfully, to tolerate at 'a' is relatively better.

After this move, it is time for noon break.]
;B[jo];W[in];B[hp];W[gn];B[kq]C[B33 is good shape, Black is successful.];W[bo]LB[dn:a][cn:b]C[W34 is tesuji, if White cuts at 'a', after the atari of B 'a', White's shape is bad.];B[cn];W[bn];B[bp];W[hr]LB[nn:a]C[The play of W38 is inexplicable, to play at 'a' is common.]
;B[jn];W[jm];B[km];W[jl];B[po];W[on];B[ln]C[B45: Black takes advantage.];W[pn];B[qn];W[qm];B[hl];W[il];B[pm]LB[rm:a]C[B51: Black should play at 'a'. Following B51, Black captures four stones, ...]
;W[pl];B[oo];W[no];B[nn];W[om]C[..., but White takes ponnuki, Black's loss is huge.];B[nm];W[nl];B[qo];W[kr]C[Besides, White can take advantage with W60 at bottom, Black clearly incurs loss.];B[lq];W[jr];B[lr]
;W[ce]C[W64 is a super-big point, not smaller that Black's capturing of four stones.];B[ml];W[mm];B[mn];W[mk];B[ll];W[nk];B[lk];W[qf];B[nd];W[lc]LB[rd:a]C[W74 is positive move, to play at 'a' is rather steady.]
;B[hm];W[dr];B[qk]LB[qh:a]C[The invasion of B77 is inevitable, but directly play at 'a' is relatively better, this way Black is light and easier to handle.];W[rl];B[qh];W[of];B[oh];W[mi];B[mh];W[lh];B[mg];W[qd]C[W86: Black initiates the ko.]
;B[qc];W[pe];B[rd];W[re];B[qe];W[jq];B[jp];W[qd];B[gr];W[gq];B[qe];W[cm];B[dn]
;W[qd];B[hq];W[ir];B[qe];W[pi];B[qd];W[ph];B[qg];W[pg];B[rf]C[In the exchange up to B109, locally Black destroys White's side territory and should be happy.];W[me]C[But in terms of the whole game, White's moyo on the left side becomes even bigger, White is still favorable.];B[pf]C[B111 is overly casual. Although Cho Chikun is very confident in dodging, he allows White to play in the left-side big moyo, too unreasonable!]
;W[gm];B[fk];W[ej];B[hj];W[gc]C[Cho Chikun is brave like this, Yamashita may not know how to continue the game.];B[hh];W[lg]LB[fh:a][eh:b]C[W118 is not simple and clear, to enclose left side at 'a' is already very good. In this unfavorable situation, Black should prepare to play at 'b' and fight desperately.];B[eh];W[fj]C[W120: White separates Black.];B[ch]C[Cho Chikun starts to dodge as he wished, the situation becomes chaotic.]

;W[kf]C[Overall, Black can't win if just making life, Black needs to live a better life.];B[kh];W[ki];B[kg];W[je];B[jf]C[Cho Chikun perhaps didn't realize this, paying a heavy price and allowing White to take ponnuki.];W[kd];B[bf];W[be];B[cf]C[B169: Black lives, ...];W[rn];B[ro]
;W[so];B[sp];W[sn];B[ls];W[qq];B[pp];W[rq];B[rp];W[qi]C[..., but White encloses territory with W180, White is still favorable.];B[oe];W[nb]LB[nf:a]C[W182 is the first bad move leading to White's defeat. if White plays at 'a', White wins the game for sure.]
;B[ae];W[ad];B[af];W[bd];B[og]C[After B187, it forms a ko.];W[nf];B[mf];W[ne];B[lf];W[li];B[ke];W[qr];B[ps]

;B[qj]C[B209: White perhaps overlooks this move.];W[oj]LB[rh:a][oi:b]C[W210: White has no choice but to retreat, if W 'a', Black will play atari at 'b', White is not easy to handle.];B[rk]C[B211: Black gains a lot, the situation becomes close, but it is still slightly to White's advantage.];W[ke];B[hd];W[hc];B[oc];W[ii];B[ih];W[nc]

;W[sm];B[ql];W[md]C[Finally W234 is a big mistake.];B[sk]C[Of course the value of B235 is bigger, if White can connect back five stones, White will win the game by 1.5 points.];W[hf];B[ie];W[od];B[ao];W[pe];B[qf];W[an];B[ap]
