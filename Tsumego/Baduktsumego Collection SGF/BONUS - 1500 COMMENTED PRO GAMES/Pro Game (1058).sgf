;B[qn]C[After the knight's move of B7, ......];W[iq];B[kq]C[..... then Black extends with B9, it is a good tempo and positive play.];W[io];B[dq]C[The sequence following the attachment of B11 is one variation of josekis.];W[cq];B[cr];W[eq];B[dr];W[ep];B[er];W[bq]
;B[fp];W[gr];B[fr];W[ko];B[mq]LB[fn:a]C[B23: Black can consider to jump out at 'a', Black would be smooth to stick his head out.];W[fn]C[In the game, although answering with the extension of B23 is very big, but White gets to cap with a good move of W24, Black is painful.];B[hp]C[Black first peeps with B25 in sente then attaches out with B27, Black has no other choice.];W[ip];B[gn];W[go]C[The hane of W28 is a tic-for-tat move, the following sequence is inevitable for both sides.]
;B[fo];W[gm];B[hn];W[ho];B[eo];W[do];B[en];W[fm];B[cm]LB[em:a][cl:b]C[B37: If Black extends at 'a', then White will make one-space extension at 'b', Black is not good.];W[bm];B[cl]
;W[em];B[dn];W[bo];B[dm];W[bl]LB[hm:a][br:b]C[The attachment of W44 is unnecessary, White certainly should atari at 'a' directly, next Black turns at 44, White can answer at 'b', this would affect Black's eye shape as well.];B[cj];W[hm];B[cg]C[Due to the addition of B45, the two-space extension of B47 directly affects White's upper left corner, this is caused by the improperness of W44.];W[nc]LB[jc:a]C[W48: White can consider to grab the big point at 'a', this would also give support to White's upper left corner.]
;B[lc];W[ne]LB[qf:a]C[W50 is questionable, White should double-approach at 'a'.];B[pf];W[pb];B[qc];W[id];B[le];W[ng];B[ph]C[After the jump of B57, Black's territory on the right side is impressive, however White lacks efficient maneuver to attack the two black stones at the top, Black is already taking the lead.];W[lh]C[W58 is obviously not a good move, after the knight's move of W58, ......];B[nh]C[...... the attachment of B59 is alert, with this move, Black has expanded his moyo on the right side.]
;W[og];B[oh];W[mg];B[je]C[B63 is a good point, this shape is not fearful of White's attack.];W[pg]C[After White pushes with W64, ......];B[qg];W[qf];B[qh];W[pe];B[rf];W[of]C[...... up to W70, although White gains, but the profit is small, and Black's moyo on the right side becomes more solid.

;W[jc]C[As to the diagonal of W72, ......];B[jd]C[Black first squeezes with B73,];W[kc];B[ic]C[Then cuts with B75, making himself thick by sacrificing is a tesuji.];W[hc];B[ib];W[hb];B[ie];W[hd];B[jb];W[kb];B[lb]
;W[kd];B[ld];W[ia];B[ke];W[ja];B[od]C[After Black extends with B89, ......];W[nd];B[nb]C[then attaches with B91, completely ruining White's eye shape and also increasing his own eye shape, this is the benefit from sacrifice.];W[ob];B[ma];W[oc];B[jh]C[With B95, Black strengthens himself and also threatens White in the upper right.]
;W[ji];B[ii];W[ki];B[hh];W[ig];B[ih];W[jk];B[nn]C[Black gets to obtain sente and strengthen at 103, Black is way ahead in territory.];W[qq]C[With the sequence after W104, White is reluctant to get into fight.];B[pr];W[dg];B[ch]
;W[pp];B[op];W[qo];B[po];W[rp];B[qp];W[gf];B[ei];W[pp];B[ro];W[qp];B[rm]LB[oo:a][np:b][pn:c][pm:d]C[Through B119, White is being killed unconditionally. Next if White plays atari at 'a', then B 'b', W 'c' and B 'd', White has no way out.]
