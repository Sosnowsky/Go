(;EV[Outstanding Endgames]DT[1705-11-20]PC[Japan]PB[Honinbo Dochi]PW[Yasui Senkaku]RE[B+1]SZ[19]C[In the opening stage of the game, Black played some questionable moves and sank into passivity. The observers all thought Black would lose the game for sure. But in the second half of the game, Black's moves are extremely brilliant, the endgames are exquisite and superb, in the end Black successfully turned the game around.];B[qd]C[Dochi is Honinbo 5, at the time of the game, he was 16 years' old, his application for 6p was strongly objected by Yasui Senkaku. Therefore, according to "quack rules", contention games should be played.];W[qp]C[Yasui Senkaku is Yasui head 4.];B[ep];W[dc];B[oq];W[cp];B[cq]
;W[gq];B[dp];W[lq]C[The play of W8 and W10 seems a little unreasonable.];B[po];W[qo];B[pn]C[The knight press of B11 and B13 plants the foreshadowing for the invasion of B15.];W[qm];B[jq];W[lo];B[jo];W[no];B[pp]
;W[qq];B[mp]LB[nq:a]C[B21 is an asking move, preventing White from fixing his shape at 'a'.];W[lp];B[pm];W[ql];B[pl];W[pk];B[ok];W[oj];B[nk]LB[nj:a][pj:b][nl:c]C[B29: Black can consider to play double-hane at 'a', after W 'b' and B 'c', Black's shape is perfect.]

;B[oi]C[So far, the local exchange comes to an end, both sides have some profit, Black can capture one stone W28 in a ladder and should be satisfied.];W[co]C[W44 is the most substantial move on the board.];B[dn]C[B45: Black aims to expand his moyo at the bottom.];W[bq];B[cr]LB[dr:a][bm:b][ml:c][lm:d][jm:e][jl:f][im:g]C[B47 is a severe mistake, Black should hang at 'a', followed by W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 'e', W 'f' and B 'g', Black's territory at the bottom would be complete and Black can fight adequately.]
;W[bm];B[ml];W[lm];B[jl];W[kk];B[dl];W[br]LB[er:a]C[W54 is a good move, later on White can gaze at 'a' any time, there is some aji left inside Black's territory, Black is not easy to handle.];B[in];W[ki];B[lj];W[jk];B[cm]
;W[bl]LB[do:a][er:b][dq:c][go:d][fn:e][iq:f][qj:g]C[The exchange of B59 with W60 is a makeshift measure, its purpose is, because the connection at 'a' becomes sente, Black can take tenuki to grab the big block move at 'g'. Otherwise, after W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 'e' and W 'f', there will be an obvious loophole inside Black's territory. However this exchange is very damaging for Black.];B[qj];W[hk];B[gl]LB[oc:a]C[B63 rigidly adheres to territory, Black should protect the corner at 'a', first forming a moyo in the upper right corner.];W[oc]C[White is able to approach the corner with W64 first, Black's effect of playing first all disappears.]
;B[lc]LB[kd:a]C[B65: For Black to play at 'a' is relatively better.];W[oe];B[pc]LB[qc:a]C[The diagonal hit of B67 is the strongest and most unyielding resistance, not allowing White to attach at 'a' to build a base.];W[pb];B[qb];W[pd];B[qc];W[le];B[ic];W[gc]C[W74 is an excellent point, Black is in a bitter fight.]
;B[md];W[nf];B[lh]C[Black attacks strongly with B75 and B77.];W[qe];B[pf];W[pe];B[nd];W[od];B[ob];W[nb];B[pa];W[nc];B[gb]
;W[fc];B[lf];W[ke];B[kb]C[B89 and B91 are clever tesujis.];W[mf];B[kh];W[li];B[mh];W[mi];B[ji];W[mj];B[nj];W[kf]C[White handles properly, so far the whole White group is stable, White is favorable for the game.]
;B[fb];W[eb];B[hb];W[og];B[ni];W[kj];B[oh];W[kr]C[White first makes life the group from the center to the bottom.];B[jr];W[qh]C[White again grabs the good point with W110, White's all groups on the board are already safe, the situation becomes clear and it is to White's advantage.];B[qn];W[rn]

In the game, Black is left with the tactic of escaping the two stones by the diagonal extension at 'a'.]
;B[ck];W[js];B[is];W[ks];B[ir];W[rd];B[rc];W[se]LB[ma:a]C[After White strengthens to make life with W142 and W144, White is left with sente usage by playing at 'a'.];B[qg];W[qf];B[sg];W[rf]

;B[qr]C[B191 is an imperative tesuji.];W[pr];B[pq];W[rr];B[qs];W[rp]C[W196: White has to give way, if White tries to capture the two black stones tenaciously, after wrapping up by atari, White is no good.];B[fg]LB[or:a]C[Because of the big endgame of the atari at 'a' in the lower right corner, now the situation is very close.];W[eh];B[ei];W[ef];B[fk]
