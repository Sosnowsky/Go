;B[cf];W[cd];B[co];W[df];B[nq];W[qn];B[cg];W[ef];B[di]C[Black first approaches with B5 then plays the sequence up to B15, which is Cho U's style.];W[oc];B[jc]LB[jq:a]C[As to the corner-approach of W16, whether Black to pincer with B17 at the top or make a moyo at 'a' on the lower side is a difficult choice.]
;W[pg];B[pe];W[lc];B[gd]LB[pc:a]C[B21: Black is not hasty to play this and should consider to make diagonal at 'a'.];W[qb];B[ne];W[md];B[qg];W[qh];B[ph];W[qi];B[og]
;W[pi];B[pf]C[Through B31, Black's shape is relatively over-concentrated.];W[jq]C[White is able to pincer-attack with W32, White's opening is successful.];B[pq]C[Following B33, Black tries to obtain sente.];W[qq];B[qr];W[oq];B[pr];W[op];B[or];W[rq];B[hq]LB[lq:a]C[The attack of B41 is positive! The original move is to make one-space extension at 'a'.]
;W[mr]C[White peeps with W42, Black is not still alive and not comfortable.];B[nr];W[jo];B[np];W[ho];B[fq];W[on]LB[dk:a]C[When W48, White can first play at 'a'.];B[nn];W[om]C[When W48 and W50, White still hopes Black to continue answer, this way White can take advantage in sente.];B[dl]C[B51 is good point!]
;W[ln]C[W52 is the vital point for attack, Black can't stick head out smoothly.];B[lq];W[lr];B[lo]C[B53 and B55: Black is forced to escape with crude moves.];W[mo]LB[ko:a][nm:b]C[W56 is strong move! If White bumps at 'a', Black will press out at 'b', White is also playable.];B[kq];W[kr];B[ko];W[kn];B[mn]
;W[jp]C[In the game, Black captures one stone, White connects with W62 and becomes thick on the outside.];B[mp]LB[mm:a]C[And White can tight-hane at 'a', White's attack is effective.];W[gr]LB[hr:a][mm:b]C[W64 is very alert! If Black blocks at 'a', White already takes advantage in sente, then White can play hane at 'b'.];B[gq];W[hr]C[B65: Of course, Black is reluctant to allow White connect back one stone with W66.];B[jn]LB[ml:a]C[But B67 is overplay! The original move is to jump out at 'a'.]
