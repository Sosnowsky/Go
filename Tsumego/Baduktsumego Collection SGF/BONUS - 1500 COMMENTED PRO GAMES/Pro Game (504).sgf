;B[de]LB[dr:a]C[In game 2, B19 was played as the knight's move at 'a'.];W[dh];B[gd];W[ee];B[ef];W[fe];B[dd];W[ec];B[cc];W[fc];B[ff];W[ge]
;B[bd];W[iq]LB[kc:a][dr:b]C[The invasion of W32 is good timing, if White plays the normal extension move at 'a', B 'b' makes the knight's move to reinforce, White's thickness on the right will be fallen into disuse.
];B[io]LB[jp:a][nq:b]C[B33 prompts White's diagonal move at 'a', then Black connects back with the two-space extension at 'b'
];W[gp]C[After thinking for a long time, White decides to initiate a counterattack with 34.];B[dq];W[cq];B[cr];W[eq]

;W[qo];B[mp];W[er];B[aq];W[kc]C[W56 comes back to grab the big point at the top, the whole board situation looks like entering endgame.];B[oc];W[rp];B[rq];W[so];B[hq];W[hp];B[ir]C[B61 and B63 are smart endgame play.]
;W[hr];B[jr];W[gq];B[ke]LB[mc:a]C[The cap of B67 is unreasonable, Black should make one-space extension at 'a' to wreck White's moyo.];W[mc];B[jc];W[jd]LB[jb:a]C[W79 making the hane move at 'a' is more solid, leaving Black with no aji to exploit.

;W[jb];B[lb];W[ld];B[mf]LB[mb:a]C[B77 at 'a' is the proper move.];W[qc];B[qd];W[ob]C[W78 and W80 is the tesujis of perfect timing.];B[mb]LB[nb:a][pb:b][nc:c]C[B81 has no choice, if Black hanes at 'a', White can push through at 81, if Black hanes at 'b' , White then bumps at 'c'.]
;W[nb]C[Through 84, an exchange results, White is obviously fruitful.];B[nc];W[pb];B[cl]C[The invasion of B85 is very big.];W[ck]LB[cj:a][cg:b]C[The attachment of W86 is a tight and good move, if White forces at 'a', Black will grab the good point at 'b'.];B[bk];W[cj];B[dl];W[bj];B[bl]
;W[cf];B[df];W[be]C[White feels very happy with W92 and W94, not only expanding his own eye shapes and also pressing Black.];B[eh];W[cg]LB[ce:a]C[W96 is an obvious mistake, White should first make the dumpling shape at 'a'.];B[ce]C[B97 is alert!];W[af];B[di];W[ej];B[ei];W[ek]
;B[dn]C[B103 captures one white stone, Black has some gains.];W[do];B[co];W[en];B[dm];W[lr]LB[op:a]C[W108 is a good move, aiming at the tactic of making the hane move at 'a'.];B[op];W[lq];B[lp];W[jq];B[kr]
;W[kp];B[mq]LB[is:a]C[If B115 ataris from the above, White can cross over with the clever hane move at 'a'.];W[is];B[mr];W[kb];B[md];W[rc]LB[fm:a][ko:b][db:c]C[The endgame value of W118 and W120 is not big, now White should play at 'a', then B 'b' ataris at 'b' and W 'c' desends, this way Black doesn't have enough points to give White komi.];B[ri]
;W[rj];B[fm];W[ci]LB[bh:a][gj:b]C[W124 is again a miscalculation! later if Black strikes at 'a', White surprisingly is not alive! so White should directly jump to 'b'.];B[fn];W[jo];B[in];W[jn];B[gj]C[After B129, the game has been turned around.];W[im];B[jm]C[B131 is relentless, not leaving any option for White to dodge.]

;B[gi];W[kj];B[lj];W[li];B[ki];W[jj];B[mi];W[lh];B[mn]C[However, Black thinks B151 and B153 are absolute sente, in fact it is a big miscalculation.];W[mj];B[lk];W[mh];B[kh]
