As a result, Yamashita Keigo 7p used only 119 moves and forced the title holder O Rissei to bow his head and concede defeat, now Yamashita Keigo is just one victory away from clinching his first Kisei title.];W[dc];B[dq];W[pp];B[ce]
;W[di];B[fe];W[ee];B[ef];W[ed]LB[gc:a][fc:b]C[After White makes a two-space high jump with B7, generally White will answer with the two-space extension at 'a' or one-space extension at 'b', but the attach and retreat of W8 and W10 are commonly used measures by O Rissei.]
(;B[cg]TR[fe]LB[ff:a][df:b][dg:c][cf:d][bf:e]C[B11: Black elects to sacrifice the marked black stone, it is the right choice. If Black wants to save it by playing at 'a', White will hane at 'b', then B 'c', W 'd', B 11, W 'e', White's corner territory is too big (see var a).];W[ff];B[eg];W[gf];B[fg]LB[fh:a]C[B15: Black must stick his head over here, otherwise next White can knight seal at 'a', Black's shape is too cramped.];W[cd]LB[ge:a][hd:b][gg:c]C[W16:  White usually will reinforce at 'a' or 'b', however, W 'a' seems slow-paced, after W 'b', Black then will not hesitate to press at 'a'. So O Rissei simply strengthens his corner, leaving the worry to Black.]
;B[do]LB[dl:a][cm:b]C[B17 is unique. The normal play is for Black to make the checking extension at 'a', however, Yamashita Keigo protects the corner with 17, intentionally leaving White the good point of 'b'.];W[cm];B[em]C[B19 is a related,  good play with B17, it aims to form a moyo at the bottom by pressing White on the left side.];W[dk]LB[cj:a][fi:b][bo:c][bn:d]C[W20: White exactly falls into the trap which Black has planned. In general, W20 is a powerful move in reply to the cap of B19. But in the current stage of the game,  White should play at 'a' patiently. If Black conceals at 'b', White can live on the spot by playing at 'c'; If Black continues to mess up White's base at 'd', White can stick his head out at 'b' and escape together with Black, there is no big profit for Black to aim for.];B[bi]C[B21: Black starts to wreck White's base, White can not make a good shape.];W[bo]C[W22: White has no choice but to enter the corner.]
;B[bk]C[B23: Black continues to spoil White's base.];W[cp];B[dp];W[cq]C[W24 and W26: White has to tolerate.];B[bn];W[bm];B[co]C[B27 and B29 are in good order.];W[bp]C[W30: White can only connect.];B[cn];W[an];B[dr]C[After Black stands at 33, White's whole group is not alive yet.]
;W[dm];B[el];W[dl];B[en];W[cj];B[bj];W[cr];B[kp]C[After Black extends with B41, Black's moyo is huge, his opening is far superior.];W[nq];B[gd]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.]
(;W[ie]LB[hd:a][hc:b][id:c][gb:d][kc:e]C[W44 is the losing move. Chang Hao 9p said, at any rate, White should attach at 'a' to press Black. If Black hanes at 'b', White then extends to 'c', after B 'd' and W 'e', it leads to a capturing race (see var a). Although White's dragon in the lower left is not alive, Black can exploit some aji at the top, but no matter what, Black itself is also dangerous.];B[ic];W[kd];B[ej];W[ek];B[fk];W[fj];B[ei]
;W[gk];B[fl];W[br];B[hf]C[B55 is a good move, it is the vital point for attacking White.];W[he];B[ge];W[gg];B[if];W[hg];B[je];W[jf];B[ig];W[ih]
;B[jg];W[jd];B[jh];W[ii]C[The sequence from 56 to 68 is inevitable, otherwise White's  key stones in the center will get captured. 

After this move, the game is closed for the first day.];B[ij]C[B69 is extraordinary! ];W[ji]C[W70: White can only get out.];B[hh]C[After Black cuts and captures with B71, White already can not move.]
(;W[ko]LB[gh:a][hi:b][gi:c][hj:d][gj:e][hl:f][gl:g][hm:h]C[W72: If White runs at 'a', then B 'b', W 'd', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f', W 'g' and B 'h', White will die.];B[hi]C[After Black captures White's key stones with B73, a lopsided victory for Black can not be altered.];W[jp];B[nc];W[pi]

 (The nose hit of B69 has been praised by many top pros, it is a proud move by Yamashita Keigo, we will see how this new star can reenergize Japanese Go arena!)])
