;B[cf];W[fq]C[The sequence from the corner approach of B5 to W8 is a popular play nowadays.];B[oc];W[qi];B[qn];W[ql]C[When Black approaches with B11, W12 is a steady move.];B[qq];W[qp];B[pq];W[op];B[rp];W[ro]
;B[rq];W[qo];B[nq];W[qf]C[White gets to first make the two-space extension with W22.];B[id];W[oe]C[B23 and W24 are miai, each gets to play one. So far, the situation is about even.];B[cj];W[md];B[on]LB[jg:a]C[B27 is a big mistake! White already has a narrow two-space extension on the right side plus two small knights, if Black wants to initiate a fight in White's thick place, it is indeed inexplicable. With B27 Black should make the large knight's move at 'a', this is just the right spot for both sides' expansion and reduction.];W[np];B[mq]
;W[mp];B[mn];W[nm];B[nn];W[lq];B[lr];W[kr];B[lp];W[kq];B[nk];W[lo]C[From W34 to W40, White stops Black from sticking the head out, White gains some profit.];B[pk];W[oj]
;B[ok];W[km]C[The knight's move of W44 is a good move, it is the vital point.];B[qk];W[qm];B[oh];W[oi];B[ni];W[nh];B[nj];W[og]C[White is able to capture two black stones, White has nothing to complain.
];B[ph];W[pi]
;B[mh];W[ng];B[kk];W[pc];B[pd];W[qc]C[But W58 and W60 is not calm enough, it equals to seeking troubles. Now expanding White's own moyo at the bottom is the right playing direction.];B[od];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[qe];W[ob]LB[pb:a]C[W66: For White to play at 'a' is better.]
;B[nb];W[pa];B[mc];W[kd];B[lc];W[li];B[lh];W[ji];B[kh];W[ld];B[jc];W[jk]C[But the sequence from W72 to W78 is extremely ferocious, Black is hard to answer, White takes a big lead.];B[jh]LB[rg:a][qg:b][rh:c][ne:d]C[B79 is also a big mistake! Black should jump to 'a' to probe White, if W 'b', then B 'c', crossing over on the first line, on the outside Black is still left with the cutting White at 'd'.]
;W[hi];B[mf];W[nd];B[nc];W[nf];B[qg]C[B85 can be considered as the losing move!];W[rg]C[White already lives with the hane of W86, although Black's calculation strength is indeed questionable. Perhaps the sequence from W72 to W78 is too strong, Black loses common sense.];B[rf];W[pf];B[rh];W[qh];B[cp]C[B91: Black opens up a new battle field.]
;W[cq];B[bq]LB[do:a]C[But with the play of B93, Black really doesn't have any consciousness of winning or losing. So far, Black can only hang at 'a' to create a ko and fight desperately for a victory.];W[co];B[bp];W[dn]C[W94 and W96 are good moves, calling off the battle after seeing good result, Ye Gui is indeed stronger than her opponent.];B[bo];W[do];B[dq];W[cr];B[dr];W[eq]
;B[br];W[lk]C[W104: White strengthens herself and also aims at the cutting point.];B[sg];W[cc];B[cd];W[dd]C[W106 and W108 are also the common tactic for reduction.];B[de];W[ed];B[cb];W[bc];B[ec]C[After Black crawls with B113, White sails smoothly.];W[fd]
;B[fc];W[gd];B[gc];W[hd];B[hc];W[ie]C[The hane of W120 is sente.];B[rn];W[mi]C[White's cut with W122 is just right timing and very good play.];B[ki];W[kj];B[ii];W[ij]
;B[jj];W[kl]C[W128: White doesn't fight the ko and try to kill Black, since White is already very clear about the outcome of the game.];B[hh];W[ji];B[ih];W[sn];B[mk];W[lj];B[ri];W[gi];B[gh];W[jd];B[ic]
;W[hf]C[After W136, White saves back several stones with W138 and W140.];B[fi];W[fj];B[ei];W[ej];B[di]C[Because it is related to big group's well-being, Black has to connect back home with the sequence from B141 to B145.];W[fg];B[fh];W[ck];B[dj];W[dk]C[White encloses a big territory with W148 and W150, the game has already been decided.];B[pn]
