;B[be];W[ac];B[dg];W[ef];B[df]C[Through B23, it forms a classical joseki in the upper left corner and is rarely seen in modern openings.];W[qc];B[cn];W[fq];B[hq];W[bp];B[nq];W[qh]LB[qj:a]C[The step of W30 is too small, White can consider to make extension at 'a', Black is very thick in the upper-left corner, White should break up the situation earlier on.]
;B[qj];W[pd];B[oj];W[qe]C[W32 and W34 are very thick moves, Japanese players relatively like this kind of set patterns.];B[ho]C[But after Black jumps up with B35, Black's moyo echoes the joseki in the upper-left corner, overall Black is satisfied.];W[cl]LB[em:a]C[The invasion of W36 is a little unreasonable. White should make the knight at 'a', to take the whole game into consideration. Here for White to start fight is a little far-fetched.];B[en];W[el];B[bo];W[co];B[bn]
;W[dj];B[dm]LB[dn:a]C[B43 reinforcing is necessary. White can wedge at 'a'.];W[fo];B[fn];W[gl];B[bq];W[ap];B[cq];W[cp];B[dq];W[er]LB[eq:a]C[W52: White should bump at 'a'. In the real game, Black is left with a ko.]
;B[hl];W[gk];B[hk]LB[hm:a]C[The play of B55 is necessary. For Black to retreat at  'a' is already very adequate.];W[go]C[W56: White starts to counterattack strongly.];B[gn];W[hn];B[io];W[hm];B[gm];W[jn]C[Through W62, both sides are a little risky.];B[dl]
;W[dk];B[bl]LB[ck:a][fl:b]C[B65: Black can also cut at 'a', locally Black could spend one less move, it is more severe. But Black has to first do a damaging exchange by playing wedge at 'b', it is difficult to make decision.];W[bk];B[cm];W[eo];B[bj];W[ak];B[ck];W[cj];B[bi]C[Through B73, it forms a ko, the situation is still very chaotic.]
;W[cl];B[jo];W[jm];B[ck];W[ko]LB[hj:a]C[W78 is weak, White should find ko threat by playing hane at 'a'.];B[cl];W[kp];B[kr];W[lm];B[hj]C[Through B83, Black can be satisfied.];W[lr]
;B[lq];W[kq];B[jr];W[mq];B[mr];W[lp];B[ls];W[qp]C[W92: White seeks a way of playing.];B[qo];W[po];B[qn];W[oq];B[np]
;W[op]LB[nr:a][lq:b]C[W98: White can first exchange W 'a' and B 'b', then push with W98, this variation is relatively complicated. In the real game, although the play is simple and clear, but White must seek a better way to settle the shape.];B[or];W[pq];B[no];W[pn];B[gr];W[eq];B[lk];W[qm];B[nm];W[jk]LB[in:a]C[Following W108, White's playing order is also questionable, White should first connect at 'a' to force Black to settle the shape.]
;B[jj];W[kk];B[kj];W[in]C[When W112, Black can ignore for now, Black is a little thicker than earlier.];B[ke]C[When Black encloses territory with B113, Black is already favorable.];W[kc];B[rm];W[rl];B[ql];W[pm];B[rk];W[rn]
;B[sl]LB[jc:a][id:b]C[B121 is a questionable move and it is small, this gives White some chances. Black should attach at 'a' or make the knight at 'b'. Overall, only if Black plays at this area, Black all can win the game easily.];W[iq];B[jq];W[jp];B[ir];W[je];B[jf];W[ie];B[if];W[hf]C[The hane of W130 is a strong move.]
;B[he];W[hd];B[ge];W[kf]C[After the hane of W130, the cut of W134 gets to work. The game seems to have been turned around.];B[ro];W[rp];B[kg];W[lf];B[lg];W[mg];B[jh];W[mf]C[Through W142, Black's loss is huge.]
;B[sn];W[pr];B[ip];W[ll];B[sp];W[rq];B[ps];W[qs];B[os];W[qr];B[ic]C[B153 is a good endgame. Afterwards, Black plays endgame calmly and still wins the game by a small margin, and White never have any chance.];W[jc];B[hc]
