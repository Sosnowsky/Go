;B[oq];W[qj];B[cq];W[dq];B[cp];W[do];B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[eq];B[cn];W[qm]C[Through W18, the opening is very steady, this opening was very popular in the past when the komi is 5.5.];B[jq]LB[fc:a]TR[fq]C[B19: Black can also consider to approach the corner at 'a', in the game Black aims to pull out the marked black stone.

Ma: The opening up to W18 is very steady, due to the direction of Black's worry-free corner, by Go theory, with B19 Black should approach the corner at 'a'.]
;W[nc];B[qf];W[pb];B[qc];W[gc]C[Ma: After White approaches the corner with W20, White protects his own corner with the large knight's move of W24, White's speed is very fast. At the top inside White's territory, there is no good invasion point and Black has to take tenuki.];B[fr];W[fs];B[hr]TR[jq]C[B25 and B27 are the follow-up maneuver of the marked black stone.];W[fp];B[gr];W[ho]LB[gp:a]C[W30 is a light and good move, the common feeling is to retreat at 'a'.]
;B[jo]LB[ce:a]C[B31 can't be omitted.

Ma: Black's sequence from B25 and B31 is the follow-up maneuver, but here Black again ends in gote, White gets the chance to strengthen the corner at 'a', Black is already clearly falling behind in the opening.];W[ce];B[pk]LB[lc:a][pm:b]C[Ma: The play of B33 is damaging to territory, now to pincer at 'a' is imperative. Even if Black wants to play on the right side, Black should just attach at 'b'.];W[qk];B[pm]C[Black's play following B35 is roughly acceptable, although Black incurs some loss in territory, but Black makes himself thicker, Black can also obtain compensations by attacking White on the left side.];W[qn];B[pn];W[qo];B[po]
;W[rp];B[ql];W[rl];B[pl];W[qq];B[pp]LB[ld:a][rk:b][rq:c]C[Ma: With W46 White can take tenuki and make the knight's move at 'a', this way Black is hard to choose whether to cut at 'b' or 'c'.];W[rn];B[gp];W[fo];B[dn]
;W[en];B[gn]C[The attack of B49 and B51 seems a little fancy.];W[go];B[em];W[hn];B[fn];W[eo];B[dl]LB[cl:a][ci:b]C[Ma: With B47 for Black to press at 49 is the original move, but after W50, Black also doesn't have any good follow-up. In the real game, the turn of W54 is steady, making a miai of 'a' and 'b'.];W[ci]TR[gp]LB[im:a][cm:b]C[Through W58, Black doesn't gain any practical effect, looking back, Black originally should find some other ways to attack, for example, with B47 Black can simply attack White by playing the knight's move at 'a', next W53 and B 'b'.]
;B[kd];W[od];B[pc];W[qb];B[oc];W[ob];B[nd];W[mc];B[oe]LB[od:a]C[Through B67, the shape is basically settled.

Ma: As to the diagonal of W60 ( at 'a'), with the sequence from B61 to B67 Black ends in gote again. And since White already sticks his head out with W8, Black's thickness at the top and bottom can't be fully utilized. Therefore with B61, Black can only block at 62 to grab territory, even though Black is also no good, at least Black can still continue.];W[jn];B[kn];W[ko]
;B[kp];W[km]C[White takes advantage in sente with W68, W70 and W72.];B[lo];W[hf]C[Through W74, White is a little favorable in the game.

Ma: White first settles the shape in sente with W68 to W72, then grabs the excellent point with W74, it is not exaggerating if we say the game is already over.];B[lb];W[rc];B[rd];W[rb];B[eh];W[dg];B[ec]C[With the sequence following B81, Black starts to pound at White.];W[dc]
;B[hc];W[hd];B[gb];W[hb];B[ic];W[fb];B[gd];W[fc];B[he];W[gf]C[Through W92, Black doesn't gains any profit, now the game enters into the situation where Lee Changho is good at, it seems Black is very dangerous.];B[il]LB[jm:a]C[Ma: With B93, Black should cut at 'a' to expand his center.]
;W[im];B[jl];W[jm];B[eg];W[fd];B[id];W[hl]C[When B97, after the exchange of W98 and B99, White takes tenuki with W100, it is a good play at this time.];B[hk];W[gl];B[gk];W[md];B[me]LB[if:a][ge:b]C[Ma: With B105, Black should hang at 'a', aiming to cut at 'b'. In the game, since Black can't make anything in the center, Black is on the way to suffer a big defeat.]
;W[dj]C[Through W106, although White is not ahead by too much, but by Lee Changho's strength, it is very difficult for him to lose this game.];B[gh];W[ge]LB[pr:a]C[When B107, W108 is a steady play, if the situation is close, White will consider to make the diagonal extension at 'a', in the real game, Lee Changho must also feel he can also win the game this way.];B[rr];W[jf]C[W100 is again a good move to take control of the situation.];B[kf];W[kg];B[je];W[if];B[rq];W[sq]
;B[sr];W[sp];B[sm];W[sn];B[ck];W[qr];B[pr];W[lf];B[ib];W[fj];B[hi];W[fk]C[After White cuts in sente with W126 and W128, White instead becomes thicker.];B[jj]
;W[co];B[bo];W[nf];B[mb];W[nb];B[lk]LB[ha:a]C[B135: Black should fight by playing at 'a'.];W[ga];B[fl];W[ne]C[B137 is clearly small, in the game after White cuts with W138, the game is already over, it seems they do have some gap in actual strength, in the second half of the game, Lee Changho's play is indeed very good.];B[kb];W[ke]
