;B[kq];W[nc];B[qg]C[B9 is one of Rui 9p's favorite moves recently. This kind of play appeared before in some of her games, now by playing B9, Black doesn't want to leave any good point for White to play.];W[pm]LB[jd:a][pn:b]C[As pre-planned, Black quickly starts the game with the opening from B1 to B7, however White seems more prudent, W6 takes White for about 4 minutes and 7 seconds, W8  takes 2 minutes and 10 seconds, W10 consumes 6 minutes and 41 seconds. Especially for W8, Lee 9p lost to Ma Xiaochun in the recent Chunlun Cup just because of this move. After going back to Korea, Lee 9p has thoroughly studied this opening. The usual play for W10 is to extend back at 'a', then Black will play at 'b', making a moyo expanding to both sides with the axis in the lower right corner.];B[po];W[pj]C[After thinking for 6 minutes, White elects to play the splitting move with W10 and W12, White is inadequate with this configuration after B9. After the game, top professionals think unanimously that so far White is a little dissatisfied. However there is no final conclusion as to how White should play, the common understanding is that B9 is a very strong move in response of W8.];B[de]LB[pc:a][kc:b][cf:c]C[The approaching move of B13 is common, but in the current situation, directly doubling up at 'a' is a good move, then W 'b' and B 'c', making the play of W8 inefficient.]
;W[dh];B[gd]C[B15: Black elects to play a big joseki, what Black thinks is that, first, when Black plays B39 ('a') at the end of this joseki, White has no good maneuver to play the ladder breaker in the lower right black corner, second, when there is no severe tactic, Black would achieve a big profit in the upper left corner. However what White considers is that, after W14, to answer B15, White can play as in the game. Although Black is favorable in the game, but, after White enters the corner with W40 (at 'b'), White would form a considerable territory, so White is also playable.]LB[bh:a][qc:b];W[ee];B[ef];W[fe];B[dd];W[ec];B[cc];W[fc];B[ff];W[ge]

;B[nf];W[me];B[of];W[lg];B[fg];W[eh];B[fh]C[B55 and B57: Black removes the hidden trouble of a potential ladder.];W[nb]C[W58: White elects to enclose territory and also aim to attack Black. The Go professionals who are watching the game feel instantly that Black is hard to select where to play next.];B[ni]C[B59: Black sticks her head out, threatening the two white stones at the bottom and also aiming to invade White's territory at the top.];W[nj];B[mi];W[nn]C[After the attachment of W60, the knight's move of W62 is careless! This is White's losing cause in this game.]
;B[np];W[mj];B[lj];W[lk];B[oj]LB[ok:a]C[The wedge of B67 is a strong move! The situation becomes chaotic. Now White is reluctant and also can't atari at 'a', instead White has to get into the war.];W[li];B[ok];W[oi]LB[kj:a]C[W70: White cuts again, if only seeking for happiness in mind, White can make a ponnuki at 'a'.];B[oh];W[pi]
;B[pk]C[The turn at 73 is huge. The sequence to 85 is inevitable for both sides.];W[qk];B[ql];W[rj];B[rk];W[qj];B[pl];W[rl];B[rm];W[sk];B[kj];W[nl];B[qm]
;W[lh]LB[kk:a]C[While having studied for several days after the game, Yoo Changhyeok has made a conclusion that W86 is a very bad move, White should simply press out at 'a', the game would be extremely complicated.];B[nh];W[rh];B[kk];W[ll];B[kl];W[lm];B[kn]C[B89 and B93 are strong moves, observers all know that they have chosen the most primitive fighting strategy: fighting for liberties.];W[mp];B[mo];W[no]
;B[lp]C[After B97, White has invested all his leftover time in the regular time.];W[km];B[jm];W[jl]C[In the capturing race, Black has 11 liberties, but White is very difficult to extend out to 11 liberties. Therefore, White elects to push and cut with W98 and W100, in order to make complications and hope that Black will make a mistake.];B[nk];W[mk];B[mm]C[Because Black only thinks to reduce White's liberties as quickly as possible, so she has played the wrong moves B101 and B103, this almost costs Black the game.];W[fi];B[gi]LB[ei:a]C[In the game, White plays the hane at 104 under the time pressure in the overtime, enticing Black to play the bad hane at 105! Black should cut at 'a'. Because Black worries about the time, and also wants to put more pressure on Lee Changho who is also in the overtime, Black quickly releases B105, this mistake also shows their difference in strength.];W[gh]
;B[ei];W[mn];B[ln];W[ml];B[mq];W[im];B[jn];W[jk]C[W114 is the last losing move, White didn't cash in on Black's mistake.];B[jj]C[The sequence after B115 is inevitable for both sides.];W[ij];B[ik];W[il]

;W[lb];B[le];W[mc]C[Lee Changho has miscalculated and neglected that Black could connect back at 145, however if fighting the ko, he is short by one ko threat (see var a).]
