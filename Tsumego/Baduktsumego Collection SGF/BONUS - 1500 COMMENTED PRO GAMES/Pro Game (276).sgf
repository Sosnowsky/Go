;B[qh]LB[nc:a]C[The sequence of B1, B3, B5 and B7 is the favorite opening of Yoo Changhyeok. However, the common play for B5 is to make the large knight's move at 'a'. Today, Yoo 9p elects to play the small knight, perhaps he has some misgivings about Lee Sedol's "sharp sword".];W[qn];B[mq]LB[nq:a]C[The large knight's move of B9 is inevitable, in Yoo Changhyeok's games, it is hard to find the small knight's move at 'a'.];W[rp];B[ql];W[on];B[pk];W[qm]
(;B[qq]LB[rl:a][oq:b][op:c][pq:d][nq:e][qp:f][jq:g]C[B15: If Black denies White's connection at 'a', then W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 'e', W 'f' and B 'g', this will also make it a game (see var a).];W[rl];B[jq]LB[fc:a][cf:b][jd:c][kq:d][oq:e]C[It is a very enticing big point for Black to approach the corner at 'a', followed by W 'b' and B 'c'. But, then White would check at 'd'. After W 'd', the striking move at 'c' is very severe, so Yoo 9p elects to make the two-space extension with B17.]
;W[jc];B[cf];W[fd];B[bd];W[cg];B[bg];W[bf];B[ch];W[dg];B[be];W[jp]LB[ci:a][jo:b]TR[ch]C[W28 is the ladder breaker, if Black answers, White can capture the marked black stone at 'a' in a ladder. Yoo Changhyeok may think even if allowing White to capture one stone, after Black wraps and ataris at 'b', Black is not afraid of White's big moyo on the left.]
;B[ip];W[bh];B[af];W[ci];B[jo];W[dh];B[cc]TR[fd]C[B35: Black grabs the corner territory, making the marked white stone a bad move, Black can adequately fight.];W[dn]LB[fq:a]C[White has reinforced with W36, it is the correct play. If White expands his moyo at 'a', Black would come and ruin White's territory on the left.];B[lc];W[ke]
;B[kg];W[md];B[mc];W[nd];B[od];W[kp];B[kq];W[mg];B[ki];W[qc]TR[od]LB[rc:a][rd:b][pc:c]C[W48 is an interesting move, after Black attaches with the marked black stone, it is generally regarded that Black has made a very thick and worry-free corner, nobody would try to make trouble in this "iron corner", but Lee Sedol still wants to test you. If Black hanes at 'a' in reply, then White would cut at 'b', Black has no follow-up move. if Black answers at 'c', White will hane at 'a', White still can take some advantage. So in the game, Yoo elects to play the strongest move by standing at 'b'.]
;B[rd];W[nc];B[nb];W[ob];B[mb];W[pg]C[W54 is an asking move.];B[ph]LB[qg:a][oe:b][og:c]C[B55: Black can only exercise patience by playing at 'a' or counter-attack at 'b'. In the game, Black attaches with B55 and expects White to draw back at 'c', then he would crawl back at 'a'.];W[qg]C[W56 is the sharpest play! inside Black's influence, Lee Sedol doesn't think how to make sabaki plays, instead he wants to kill Black!];B[oh]
;W[og];B[nh];W[pb];B[oe];W[rc]C[W60 and W62 are good moves, White first extends his liberties in the corner and then prepares to kill Black. ];B[ng];W[nf];B[of];W[ld];B[kc]
(;W[kd]LB[jd:a][ne:b][mf:c][me:d]C[W66 and W68 again are good move. W68 at 'a' would form the common shape, however, Black would push at 'b', after W 'c', Black can push again at 'd', White is no good (see var a).];B[jb];W[rh]C[W70 is the killing move.]
(;B[rg]LB[ri:a][rf:b][sh:c][qi:d][sd:e]C[B71: If Black hanes at 'a', then W 'b', B 'c', W 71, B 'd' and W 'e', Black would still get killed (see var a).];W[rf];B[sg]
(;W[qf]LB[sh:a][sf:b][pf:c][re:d][sd:e][pc:f][rb:g][pe:h]C[W74: White has calculated accurately. If White ataris at 'a', then B74, W 'b', B 71, W 73, B 'c', W 71, B 'd', W 'e', B 'f', W 'g' and B 'h', Black still can make life (see var a).];B[sc];W[sb];B[sd];W[rb];B[ri]
;W[pd];B[pe];W[qe];B[pc];W[se]C[The moves from W80 to W84 is a sequence of tesujis, Black gets captured by one liberty. Black's big and thick corner now becomes White's territory, it is unimaginable!
