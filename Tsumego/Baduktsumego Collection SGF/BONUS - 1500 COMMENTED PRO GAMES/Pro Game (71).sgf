For the opening stage of this game, Honinbo Shuho once praised: The opening of this game is impressive and magnificent! After his praise, it simply becomes a popular opening later on. And the marvelous move of W130 makes you thumb the table and shout "bravo"! This move makes sacrifice in order to gain, its cleverness is unconventional. Later on, Go pros regard this move together with the clever move of no category (please see Japan Famous Blood Vomiting Game) is different in approach but equally satisfactory in result! It is indeed a hard-to-come-by famous move!];B[qd]C[This game is Mizutani Nuiji's representative work. The game had been closed for a total of four times, the move of W130 is highly praised by Go pros in both ancient and modern time.];W[dc];B[od];W[op];B[co]
;W[dq];B[ck];W[qp]LB[qj:a][ce:b]C[W8: White encloses the corner with the simple jump, aiming at stressing the value of the big point at 'a', next if Black plays at 'a', then White can enclose the corner at 'b'.];B[ce];W[qj];B[mq]C[B11 was a popular play at that time.];W[ed];B[fq]C[The pincer attack of B13 is powerful!];W[do];B[dn]
;W[fp]C[W16 is a variation according to the current situation.];B[dp]C[The atari of B17 is formalistic and seems questionable.];W[gq];B[cq]C[The hane of B19 is the right move.];W[eq];B[jc];W[df];B[cg];W[qg];B[pk];W[qk];B[pl]
;W[oi];B[mk];W[lc];B[nc]C[B31 is inevitable.];W[le];B[pq]C[B33: The invasion is in time!];W[oq];B[or];W[nr]C[W36: White takes influence with the sacrifice of the corner, it is the right strategy.];B[pr];W[nq];B[pp]
;W[po];B[qo];W[pn];B[rp];W[qn];B[ro];W[mp]C[Through W46, the local exchange comes to a temporary end, Black's lower right corner is impressive and should have nothing to complain.];B[mn];W[lo];B[km]C[With B47 and B49, Black has reduced White's territory and also managed his weak stones in the center.];W[jn]C[W50 is inevitable.];B[je]
;W[kg];B[og]LB[jm:a]C[As to the knight's move of W52, Black accepts the fight positively with B53 but it seems a little unreasonable. Later on, pros like Honinbo Shusai point out that now Black's situation is not bad, Black should strengthen the center by pressing at 'a' and doesn't need to fight with White in a hurry.];W[ng]C[W54 is an inevitable counterattack.];B[mf]C[B55 and B53 are related moves, though B95, both sides have obtained what they want.];W[nf];B[me];W[ke];B[mg];W[mh];B[lh];W[mi]
;B[li];W[lg];B[lj];W[if]C[After White's knight's move of W66, Black's group at the top can only make life grievously.];B[hd];W[ne];B[md];W[kc];B[fc];W[jb];B[ib];W[ic];B[hc]
;W[jd];B[id];W[ie]C[W78: White captures one stone and becomes thick.];B[pf];W[qf];B[qe]C[Black settles the shape in sente with B79 and B81, the play is alert, otherwise White is left with the aji of the attachment at 'A' in the upper right corner, it probably will affect the endgame later on.]LB[qc:a];W[oh];B[il]C[Black gets to grab the vital point with the knight's move of B83, it becomes a close and complicated game.];W[hm]C[W84: White attacks Black in the center and at the same also marches towards Black's territory on the left side.];B[dg]
;W[eg];B[eh]C[B85 and B87: Before making life, Black first strengthens his territory on the left.];W[ef]LB[fg:a][de:b][ee:c][cf:d]C[The connection of W88 is the right move, if White extends at 'a' instead, after B 'b' and W 'c', the aji of the push at 'a' will disappear.];B[eb];W[db];B[jc];W[jf];B[gb]C[With the sequence from B89 to B93, Black's group at the top is completely alive.]
;W[fh];B[ei];W[ij]C[With W96, White threatens Black in the center and also prepares for invading on the left side.];B[fi]LB[hl:a]C[The turn of B97 is a strong move, Black is confident that temporarily Black in the center will not come under severe attack. However, later on White's press at 'a' is sente, White's territory on the left will be affected.];W[cr]C[W98 is a big endgame worth about 20 points.];B[bd]C[B99 is a big mistake.];W[dl]C[The shoulder-hit of W100 is severe!];B[gh];W[ge]C[After the exchange of B101 and B102, ...]
;B[fl]LB[cl:a][hl:b][dj:c]C[..., B103 is the most intense counterattack. If Black blocks at 'a' instead, because White's press at 'b' is sente, when the time is ripe, White could pierce through at 'c'.];W[cl]C[W104: White suddenly invades the left side, it is very brave, assessing Black is weak both on the left and in the middle, White definitely will obtain a huge profit in the following fight.];B[em]C[B105: Black has no choice but to chase and kill White's two stones, if White escapes, Black's territory is surely inadequate.];W[hl]C[W106: White separates Black's connection between the middle and the left side.];B[kn]C[Black has assurance of success in making life with the sequence following B107.];W[ko];B[kk];W[gd]

This way, the value of White's block at 'e' will clearly increase. In a close situation, this difference perhaps will affect the outcome of the game. ]
;W[eo];B[bn];W[gj]C[After White has gained in the upper left corner, then White retreats with W132 and ataris with W134, it is very good sequence, so far the game becomes very close.];B[ek];W[hk];B[fj];W[jm];B[on];W[oo];B[ql];W[rn];B[ki];W[rc]C[W144 is an asking move.]
