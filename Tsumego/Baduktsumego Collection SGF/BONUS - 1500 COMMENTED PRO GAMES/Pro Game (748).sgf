;B[cj];W[cl];B[cf];W[ch];B[bh]LB[ef:a]C[B11 is rarely seen nowadays, the usual play is to jump at 'a'.];W[bg]LB[fc:a]C[W12: White initiates a direct confrontation, it is a fierce move, to make the knight's move at 'a' is a steady play.];B[cg];W[bi]
(;B[bf]LB[dh:a][ci:b][di:c][bj:d][bd:e]C[B15: If Black ataris at 'a', then W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 15 and W 'e', White can not be satisfied (see var a).];W[ci];B[cc];W[cd];B[dc];W[bc];B[ed]LB[bb:a][bd:b]C[B21 is a good sequence play, if Black first exchanges B 'a' for W 'b', it would help White.]
(;W[de]LB[ee:a][fd:b][df:c][bd:d]TR[ed]C[W22: If White hanes at 'a', then Black will draw back at 'b', White still need to connect with W22, if White hangs at 'c', then Black can cut at 'd', White is no good (see var a), this is also the reason why Black just simply hanes with the marked stone earlier.];B[fd];W[eg];B[dg]LB[ef:a][ee:b]C[B25: If Black crosscuts at 'a', then White can push at 'b', Black is no good.]

(;B[km]LB[in:a][hm:b][hn:c][gm:d][fo:e]C[B77: Black takes a big risk, for Black to capture at 'a' is the proper move, if White escapes at 'b', then B 'c', W 'd' and B 'e', White would be killed (see var a).];W[in]C[After W78, Black is difficult.];B[mi]C[After 79, it leads to a chaotic fight.];W[mj];B[nj];W[mk];B[ni]
