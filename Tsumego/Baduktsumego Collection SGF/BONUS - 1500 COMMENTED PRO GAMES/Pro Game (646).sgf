;W[eq];B[fq];W[dq];B[qn];W[nq];B[gp];W[cn];B[kq]C[The opening up to B13 is very popular in Korea.];W[rp];B[nc]LB[pj:a]C[B15: By Go theories, for Black to make extension at 'a' is big, the play in the real game is Choi Cheolhan's unique understanding.];W[de]
;B[ce];W[cf];B[cd];W[dg];B[ef]C[The peep of B21 is necessary, making White's four stones heavy, Black can attack later.];W[df];B[fd];W[qj]C[W24 is a good point, it seems White opens up the situation.];B[qh];W[oj];B[oh];W[mj]
;B[id]C[B27 and B29: Normally Black always first handles B9, in the game, Black elects to first expand his situation at the top, this is also Choi Cheolhan's unique place.];W[lh];B[dj]C[B31: Black still ignores B9 and first attacks White's four stones, Black's thinking is consistent.];W[ei]LB[fh:a]C[White appears not calm under Black's strong attack, W32 at 'a' is the original move. W38 and W40 making Black's top into real territory are undoubtedly crude moves.];B[ej];W[fj]C[W32 and W34 are unreasonable!];B[fi]C[Black cuts with B35, Black sinks into a bitter battle.];W[di];B[cj];W[ed]
;B[ec];W[fe];B[gd];W[fk];B[fh];W[dl];B[cl];W[cm];B[bg]C[B47 is a good move!];W[eg]LB[bf:a]C[If W48 at 'a', Black will play at 48, White has no enough liberties.];B[bf]
;W[he];B[ge];W[gf];B[hf];W[gg];B[if];W[ih]C[Through W56, although White manages to capture two stones, Black's profit at the top and left side is very big, Black is successful.];B[ko]C[B57 is an excellent point for both sides.];W[oc];B[ob];W[pc];B[nd]C[As to W58, B59 and B61 are strong moves of Choi Cheolhan style!]
;W[oe];B[qe];W[pe];B[rj]C[Generally speaking, this kind of play is very risky, but Choi Cheolhan is good at calculation and prepares the attachment of B65.];W[mf]C[W66: If White answers on the right side, White's top is clearly in danger. In the game, it forms an exchange, which is about even.];B[qk];W[je]LB[ld:a]C[W68 is a careless move. White should first play the knight at 'a'. So far, Choi Cheolhan's Black is clearly favorable.];B[le]C[White perhaps overlooks the severe counterattack of B69.];W[ie];B[lf]
;W[hd];B[og]C[It forms an exchange again, but Black obviously gains a big profit.];W[qf];B[rf]C[But afterwards Choi Cheolhan's play loses common sense.];W[re];B[rd]LB[qg:a]C[B77: Black should take advantage at 'a', White has no tactic in the corner.];W[lc];B[ne];W[hq];B[gr];W[jq]

;B[qi];W[ql];B[pk];W[hm];B[hb]LB[lm:a]C[B113 is the losing move, Black should make the knight's move at 'a'.];W[lm]LB[jf:a]C[Black's original purpose of B113 is to threaten White at 'a', but unexpectedly White takes tenuki alertly and first attack Black's big dragon at the bottom with W114.];B[gm]C[Following B115, although Black makes life, White encloses a big territory on the right side, Black's loss is huge.];W[rm];B[pj]
;W[mo];B[ln];W[mn];B[im];W[hl];B[km];W[lp];B[lo];W[mp];B[kp];W[pl];B[nr];W[mq]
;B[mr];W[or];B[ll];W[mm];B[pr];W[os];B[oq];W[pq];B[ns];W[op];B[jf];W[ib]C[But at the top, White can hane with W142, Black doesn't gain any profit, the situation has been turned around.];B[jh]

;B[kf]C[In the following endgame, although Black takes some advantage, ...];W[jg]LB[ki:a]C[..., for example, with W158 White should play at 'a', but Choi Cheolhan's small defeat can't be avoided.];B[sk];W[rl];B[er];W[dr];B[nm];W[om];B[nl];W[nn];B[ki]
