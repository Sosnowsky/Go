;B[df];W[ce];B[cf];W[de];B[ef];W[ee];B[ff]C[The opening up to B13 is O Meien's unique style.];W[ep];B[eo];W[fo];B[do];W[fn];B[fp]
;W[eq]LB[gp:a]C[The descent of W20 is a very surprising move. In my eyes, with W20, for Black to atari at 21 is almost inevitable.];B[gp];W[cq];B[bq];W[br];B[dq];W[cr];B[dp];W[bp];B[bo];W[aq];B[er]C[Through B31, White only lives with a small corner, White is not successful.]
;W[lq];B[lo];W[oq]C[W34 is rarely seen.];B[np];W[nr];B[mr];W[or];B[mq];W[jn]C[W40 is a good point for reduction, looking back, the earlier W34 takes the whole game into account.];B[hn]LB[jp:a]C[B41 is a questionable move. Black should protect territory at 'a', this way Black is thick and also Black will get a considerable territory, Black is clearly favorable.];W[jp]C[The jump of W42 is big, Black is not easy to control the situation.]
;B[lm];W[kl];B[jm]C[B45: Black seeks a way of playing. Through B55, it leads to a chaotic fight.];W[km];B[kn];W[in];B[jl];W[kk];B[hm];W[lp];B[nn];W[lr];B[mk]
;W[cn];B[co];W[hj];B[hl];W[fi];B[hi]LB[dj:a]C[The attachment of B61 is local tesuji, but Black can also consider to defend at 'a', this way Black is easy to handle.];W[gi];B[ij];W[hh];B[ii];W[ci];B[gh]
;W[cl]C[W66 and W68: White obtains a lot of territory, Black's territory is already inadequate.];B[di]LB[jc:a][hg:b][eh:c]C[B69 is heavy and the losing move of this game. At any rate over here Black shouldn't end in gote again. Black should make extension on the side at 'a', if White extends at 'b', Black can jump to 'c' and take sente, here Black has nothing to worry about.];W[dh];B[eh];W[dj];B[ei];W[ej];B[fh];W[kc]C[W76 is an excellent point.]
;B[ic];W[nc];B[oc];W[nd];B[pf];W[ke]C[After White jumps to 82, it seems Black's thickness is useless.];B[mg];W[qk];B[me];W[hd]C[White scores again with W84. When Black attacks with B85, W86 is a good counterattack.];B[ld];W[kd]
;B[lc];W[kb];B[lb];W[le];B[md]C[Through B93, it forms an exchange, Black doesn't gain profit by attacking. Black's territory is already very inadequate.];W[lg];B[qi];W[mf];B[nf];W[lf];B[ne];W[la];B[cc]
;W[bc];B[ec]C[After this move, it is time for lunch break.];W[cb]C[W102 is a conservative play in a favorable situation,, but White is still leading in the game.];B[gd];W[gc];B[fd];W[hc];B[io];W[mo]C[The purpose of B109 is not clear, following W110 White forces Black to settle the shape, through W118, White becomes even more solid.];B[no];W[mn];B[mm]
