;W[er];B[bm];W[bn];B[bl];W[bp];B[fq];W[dl];B[ap];W[ao];B[fr];W[bk];B[cs]C[Up to the hane of B31, it completes the large avalanche joseki, which appeared twice before in the final games between the teacher and student.];W[jd]C[W32: White elects to make the high extension at the top, this is the move that Hu Yaoyu played in the Nong Shim Cup against him, this way it is easier for White to take control of the situation. In the two Kisung games, Lee Changho played the small knight's move in the lower right, Black made the one-space pincer, but Lee Changho lost that two games, so he wants to vary in the game.]

;W[qj]LB[qf:a][pi:b][qk:c]C[The splitting move of W46 is common, in the game between Hu Yaoyu and Lee Changho, Hu approached at 'a' in the upper right, Black made the two-space pincer at 'b', then White played the counter-pincer at 'c', which is an interesting conception.];B[ql];W[qg];B[qe];W[nc];B[nd];W[md];B[ne];W[pb];B[ph]

;B[pl];W[rl];B[rm];W[oj];B[em];W[el];B[fm];W[fl];B[gm];W[mr];B[hk]C[The knight's move of B79 is a dangerous move, Black still should answer in the lower left, which is more urgent.];W[or];B[pr]
;W[nq];B[os];W[nr];B[pq];W[jq]C[With the sequence from W80 to W86, White has completely destroyed Black's territory potential, Black is a little dissatisfied.];B[lq];W[lr];B[kq];W[kr];B[ir];W[jr];B[ko];W[jo]

;W[nk];B[ld];W[gl];B[hm];W[jm];B[jl];W[kl];B[mn];W[hl];B[jk];W[kk];B[ji]C[Through the diagonal of B119, White has taken sente, it is a close game while White is slightly favorable.];W[gh]LB[im:a][fo:b]C[W120: For White to hit at 'a' to exchange with B 'b' then play at 120 is more strict.]
;B[im];W[il];B[kj];W[lj];B[ml];W[mk];B[hh]LB[ip:a][ki:b][jj:c][jh:d]C[The attachment of B127 is to prevent the cut. If Black peeps at 'a', White's dragon would die immediately, but if this move is omitted, then W 'b', B 'c' and W 'd', Black is powerless to fight in the capturing race.
];W[ik];B[jj]
;W[ip];B[gg]C[With the hane of B131, Black has gained a small profit.];W[fg]C[But White gets to play the hane of W132 and can seal off his territory, White is favorable for the game.];B[hg];W[gf]LB[ff:a]C[The hane of W134 is a questionable move, White should extend at 'a'.];B[rf];W[sg];B[mb];W[kb];B[id]C[White has obviously overlooked the strong ladder breaker of B139, White has incurred some loss locally.]

;B[ee];W[ed];B[gi];W[fi];B[gj];W[no]C[W158 is a mistake, not a sente move.];B[fj]C[After the turn of B159, White has suffered a big loss, therefore White loses the game.];W[om];B[nn];W[on];B[oo]LB[mo:a][lm:b][lk:c][ol:d]C[Through the cut of B163, White already can't continue the game, if White resists with the attachment at 'a', the turn of B 'b is sente, then the throw-in at 'c' and the push at 'd' becomes miai, White is no good.

Cho Hunhyun leads 1:0, the game 2 will take place on 10/31.]
