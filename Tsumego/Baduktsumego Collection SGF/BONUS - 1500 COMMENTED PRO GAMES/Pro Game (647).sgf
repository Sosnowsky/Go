Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[Recently Xie He keeps winning in international tournaments (in fact, he achieved 10 consecutive wins), his state is extremely well!];W[pp];B[dc];W[df]C[W4 is a recommended move by Mr. Go Seigen.];B[fd]
;W[dq];B[do];W[cm]LB[ch:a]C[B7 helps White to pincer with W8, it is not good, for Black to pincer-attack W4 at 'a' is relatively normal.];B[bo]LB[en:a][cq:b]C[For Black to play at 'a' or 'b' as joseki is better.
];W[fp];B[en];W[dk];B[hq]C[B9 and B13: Black starts to fight strongly, Lee Sedol thinks his strength is bigger!];W[hp]
;B[ip];W[ho];B[eq];W[ep];B[dp];W[dr]LB[er:a][cq:b]C[W20 is a beautiful move! It is not exaggerated if we are saying this is the winning move, it destroys Lee Sedol's plan. By joseki, W20 should be played at 'a', this way after Black takes the corner at 'b', Black can invade the left side, this is Lee Sedol's ideal thinking, however at this situation, since the right side is White's corner, the variation of W20 appears very favorable!];B[fr];W[fq]C[W22 is the right move.];B[gr];W[er]
;B[el];W[kq]C[White gets to pincer-attack with W26, Black's situation is not good.];B[kp];W[lp];B[jq];W[ko];B[io];W[hn];B[kr];W[lq];B[lr];W[nq];B[dh]C[In the real game, with B37 Black seeks to attack each other, it is the only move, simply escaping can't be considered.]
;W[ek];B[fl];W[hl];B[fk]LB[hk:a]C[B41: for Black to stick the head out at 'a' is more favorable.];W[ei];B[eh];W[di];B[ch];W[gj]C[White seals off with W46, Black appears a little painful.];B[hk];W[dm]
;B[fn];W[gk];B[gl];W[hj];B[ik]LB[il:a][hm:b]C[B53 is too reasonable! Here not sure what Lee Sedol thinks, after White attaches at 'a', the fight is clearly not to Black's advantage. With B53 Black should escape at 'b', the game is still early.];W[il];B[in];W[hm];B[dl];W[cl];B[bj]
;W[bk];B[cj];W[ci];B[bi];W[ck];B[fj]C[Black pushes and cuts with B65, it forms a capturing race, the variation here is one way street.];W[fi];B[gi];W[fh];B[gh];W[ij];B[fg];W[cp]
;B[co];W[gg];B[hh];W[eg];B[ff];W[bg];B[bh];W[bf]C[Through W80, White is clearly one liberty faster than Black.];B[jk];W[ih];B[jl];W[bq];B[bp]
;W[cq];B[hg];W[em]LB[jj:a][bm:b]C[W88 is surely a play in a favorable consciousness! Now the best move is to attach at 'a', although Black can manage to live at 'b' on the left side, White gains a big profit on the outside, this way White will have a big advantage.];B[fm];W[bm];B[de]LB[ce:a]C[B91 should be a miscalculation, for Black to reduce liberties at 'a' is better, after White hangs at 'a', Black incurs loss in points.];W[ce];B[kh]C[B93 is a good move! White can only stick the head out inconveniently, Black takes a big advantage, the situation appears a little messy.];W[ii]
;B[ig];W[ki];B[lh];W[lj];B[ef];W[dg];B[cd];W[bd];B[ae];W[cc];B[dd];W[ad];B[cg]
;W[cf];B[bc];W[ab]LB[bb:a][cb:b]C[W110 is hard to understand, if White plays atari at 'a', next B 'b' and W110, this variation is clearly better than the real game.];B[bb];W[cb];B[db];W[ai]C[W114 is a good move! If White is not careful here, Black will be left with ko tactic.];B[ni]LB[oc:a][mj:b][pe:c]C[B115 is the losing move! It is hard be imagine Lee Sedol who is very sharp will play such a slow move! White gets to first approach in at 'a', Black wants to kill this white stone, unless Xie He is sleeping! With B115 Black should play at 'b' and try to protect the corner at 'c' in sente, this way Black may still have a hope.]
;W[mk];B[nk];W[nl];B[ok];W[jh];B[jg];W[oc];B[pb];W[pc];B[qc];W[ob];B[qb];W[lb]C[The dodging sequence following W128 is very brilliant.]
;B[mc];W[mb];B[nc];W[nb];B[jb];W[jc];B[ib];W[pe];B[rf];W[qf];B[qe];W[pf];B[ne]
;W[rg];B[re];W[me]C[W134 and W144 are all vital points for dodging.];B[nf];W[nd];B[ld];W[ic];B[md];W[od];B[hb];W[ng];B[mf];W[qh]C[When W154, in fact Black already can concede the game, Black's following tenacious resistance can only be considered desperate fight.]
