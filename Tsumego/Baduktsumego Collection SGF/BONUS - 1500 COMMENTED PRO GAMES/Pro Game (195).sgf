;B[cn];W[fp];B[gp];W[fo];B[eq];W[dq];B[go];W[gn]LB[fn:a]C[W14 is strong and unyielding, for White to extend at 'a' is relatively steady.];B[ep]LB[fn:a][dn:b]C[B15: If Black cuts at 'a', then White will press at 'b', both sides have no assurance of success in the following variations.]
;W[eo];B[do]C[B17: Black fights directly, it is Cho Hunhyun's usual style.];W[gq];B[fn];W[en];B[em];W[fm];B[dn];W[fn];B[dr];W[cr];B[er];W[gr]
;B[cq];W[ho]C[Through W30, it forms a situation of Black's territory vs. White's outside thickness.];B[mq]C[B31: Black gets to make two-space extension and can be satisfied.];W[cl]C[W32 is the vital point for the shape, Black dares not act aggressively.];B[cf]C[B33: Black turns around to approach the corner, it is a clever choice.];W[dh];B[ef];W[fd];B[bd];W[cc];B[bh]C[The sequence up to B39 is common joseki.]
;W[el]C[W40: White must strengthen.];B[qm];W[on];B[pk];W[qf];B[qh]C[Through B45, Black's speed is very fast and Black's shape is smooth.];W[nd];B[pf];W[pg];B[qg];W[pc];B[qe]
;W[qc]C[White's joseki selection from W46 to W52 is appropriate.];B[lc];W[rf];B[re];W[of];B[pe];W[mc]LB[nb:a][ic:b]C[W58: White aims to obtain sente, if White strengthens by jumping at 'a', then Black will make two-space at 'b', White is hard to tolerate.];B[ld];W[ic];B[bc]C[B61 looks small but big in reality.]
;W[mf]LB[ne:a]C[W62: White prevents Black from sealing off at 'a'.];B[ie];W[jc]C[W64 is the vital point, if Black grabs this point, Black can easily fix shape.];B[ke];W[jf];B[lg]LB[je:a]C[B67: If Black connects at 'a', Black appears heavy.];W[je]LB[ph:a]C[The push and cut of W68 is worth study, for White to press at 'a' is just right timing.];B[jg]
;W[kf];B[lf];W[me];B[le];W[if];B[md];W[nc];B[mg];W[ne];B[ph]C[Through B79, Black becomes very thick, White's profit is small.];W[ln]C[W80: White has to escape in gote and can't be satisfied.];B[fe]LB[qp:a]C[B81: Black probes White, but it seems unnecessary, to make diagonal at 'a' is relatively better.]
;W[ee];B[ff];W[ce]C[White's counterattack of W82 and W84 is to Black's surprise.];B[df]LB[be:a]C[B85: If Black blocks at 'a', then White will wedge at 85 and make a ko, since White has big ko threats in the lower-left corner, Black is not good.];W[be];B[bf];W[cd];B[gd];W[gc];B[ae];W[bb]LB[ed:a]C[W92: White takes a big risk, the original move is to connect at 'a'. In the real game, White's aji is not good.]
;B[ab];W[ba];B[fc];W[ed];B[hc];W[gb];B[id]C[Black's counterattack from B95 to B99 is inevitable.];W[ge];B[hd];W[jd]C[W100 and W102: White has to fight.];B[hb];W[hf]
;B[db];W[fb];B[eb]C[B105 and B107: Black is very relentless.];W[ec];B[cb];W[ea];B[ca]C[Through B111, although White is not favorable, White obtains sente, the outcome of the game is not clear.];W[og]C[W112 is a huge move and kind of counter-sente.];B[mj];W[rd]TR[og]LB[sb:a]C[W114 is again a profit from the marked white stone, otherwise Black can slide at 'a'.]
;B[rg];W[kq];B[lp];W[qq];B[qr];W[oq]C[W118 and W120: White is alert.];B[or];W[pp];B[pr];W[qn];B[pm];W[rq]C[Through W126, White gains some profit.]
;B[kp]C[B127: Black presses in sente and is very happy.];W[iq];B[kr];W[jq];B[rr];W[rm];B[rl];W[ro];B[sm];W[fh];B[bj]C[B137 makes White giving up the idea of killing Black in the upper-right corner strongly.];W[kj]C[W138 is a good move, White forms some potential in the center.]

;B[ol];W[cp];B[bq];W[pl];B[oj];W[ol]C[White's endgame from W150 to W170 is very brilliant.];B[pj];W[ci];B[bi];W[lq];B[mp];W[no];B[op]
;W[np];B[nq];W[bp];B[br];W[hj]C[W182 is a good move, White is clearly going to form territory in the center.];B[lb];W[he];B[na];W[ob];B[ei];W[eh];B[cj];W[dj]

;B[bs];W[rm];B[jr]C[B219 is clearly a damaging ko threat.];W[ir];B[rn];W[cg];B[bg];W[rm];B[ck];W[dk];B[rn];W[af];B[ag]
;W[rm];B[qa];W[pb];B[rn];W[cm];B[an];W[rm];B[ap];W[js]C[W238: White grabs the big endgame worth 5+ points, Black is not optimistic.];B[rn];W[jm];B[jl];W[rm]
;B[ms];W[ks];B[rn];W[lm];B[ll];W[rm];B[ja];W[ib];B[rn];W[aq];B[co];W[rm];B[od]
;W[rn]LB[aa:a]C[W256 eliminating the ko is declaration of victory. Overall for the whole game, Black is leading in opening, but B81 is a little unreasonable, White redeems some loss. Later on Black is reluctant to live completely by playing at 'a' to ensure the sente descent at 183, next White plays two consecutive moves of W136 and W138 and gains a lot of profit. In the endgame, White forces tightly by using favorable ko threats, however Cho Hunhyun lacks psychological preparation. The champion mystery has to be revealed until tomorrow.];B[rb];W[sb];B[sq];W[sp];B[sr];W[kb];B[ka];W[lh];B[li];W[kh];B[mh]
