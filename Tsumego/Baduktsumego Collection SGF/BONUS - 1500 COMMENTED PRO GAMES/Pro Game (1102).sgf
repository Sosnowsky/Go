;W[cf];B[jc]LB[kc:a]C[B7: Normally Black will play at 'a' to form the "Mini Chinese" fuseki.];W[qn]C[W8: White also doesn't elect to play the popular high approach, both sides try to seek variations.];B[qp];W[pj];B[qh];W[on];B[pm]LB[mq:a][pl:b]C[The peep of B13 is a little damaging, Black wants to simply extend at 'a', later on Black can invade at 'b'.];W[pn]
;B[mq];W[rj];B[od]LB[mc:a][oc:b]C[B17 is one of Gu Li's very regrettable moves after the game, leaving White the good invasion point at 'a', still to protect the "worry-free" corner at 'b' is more substantial.];W[fq];B[fe];W[db];B[oi]C[Black expands influence strongly with B19 and B21, but after White invades, Black gains very little by attacking, this causes Black to fall behind in territory.  From the following game process, we can see Black should first reserve the territory-damaging exchange of B19 and W20, there will be more variations.];W[mc];B[oj];W[pk]

;B[fn];W[iq]C[Through W52, White gets to play on both sides, Black's one group is still not stable, White's situation is optimistic.];B[dg];W[df];B[eg];W[bh];B[kb];W[mf]LB[jf:a]C[W58: White should hang at 'a'.];B[ne];W[kg];B[jf]
;W[mh]LB[li:a]C[W62: White also should make the knight's move at 'a', the shape in the real game leaves hidden trouble.];B[ro];W[rh];B[qi];W[ri];B[qg];W[rg];B[rf];W[rn];B[ci];W[ch];B[ei]
;W[dh]LB[gl:a][hn:b][cj:c]C[The push of W74 is a very bad move! It is also the losing cause of this game! The correct play is to first jump at 'a', Black can only answer at 'b', White then clamps over at 'c', this way White will get more territory and White's shape is also thicker.];B[li]LB[ck:a][cl:b][ej:c]C[B75 is intense and violent! Black is left with the peep at 'a' on the left side, next W 'b', then Black can double at 'c' strongly, White has some comprehension, White's group at the top becomes more painful.];W[mi];B[mj];W[ki];B[lh];W[lj]C[W78 and W80: White resists tenaciously.]
;B[kj];W[lk];B[kh];W[jh];B[ji];W[lg];B[ki];W[jg];B[kk];W[hh];B[gj]C[Through B91, White can't take care of both sides.];W[hj];B[hk]
