Translation:GoGameWorld.];B[qd]C[The current Japanese #1 Yamashita Keigo likes to play at high position and usually surprises the world with a move at 5-5, his unique style in Japanese Go world is very rare. However, on 11/20, in the game 2 of best-of-5 series of the 29th Tengen final, the defending champion Hane Naoki has successfully thwarted Yamashita Keigo's unique style and tied the series at 1:1.];W[dc];B[dq];W[co];B[pp]

;B[ce];W[fe];B[ec]C[The opening up to B21 was just played in the Meijin challenger final between Yamashita Keigo and Yoda Norimoto.];W[fd]C[W22: White starts to vary after more study, in that game White takes,  but locally White ends in gote and is not good.];B[db];W[pe];B[qe];W[pf];B[qg];W[fp]C[After the knight-pressing move of W24, White again puts pressure on another Black's small-point with W28, White has developed a huge moyo and is absolutely reasonable.];B[pg];W[og]
;B[oh];W[nh]C[As to the attachment of B29, White plays the double hane of W30 and W32, continuing to make the moyo thicker is a momentum.];B[of];W[ng];B[pd];W[od];B[oe];W[ne];B[qf];W[nf];B[ep]LB[do:a]C[B41: If Black presses at 'a', White will wedge and it would lead to the great slant joseki, because Black is not favorable in the ladder, the fight is not to Black's favor, in the game, Black elects to crawl on the third line, although it is a strategy, but it seems White's moyo is too big.]

;W[lc]LB[jd:a]C[W54: For White to play at 'a' is more positive.];B[fb];W[bh]C[W56: White encloses territory at the maximum limit, forcing Black to invade.];B[gc];W[hd];B[ej];W[ei];B[el];W[fj];B[fk];W[dj]

White hopes Black to reinforce himself with W70 and W72, But Black didn't, White don't know how to handle it, from the result, with W74, to atari at 'a' protecting the side territory is better.];B[ej];W[gj]

;W[rr];B[rq];W[qr];B[oj]LB[ni:a]C[B91 is a good move! But Black should reserve the turn of B87, this way Black can play accordingly, if White hangs at 88, Black also would be very happy to hang at 'a'.];W[oi]LB[ol:a]C[W92 is a mistake! White should simply play at 'a', this way Black is very difficult.];B[pj];W[ol];B[nj]C[B95: Black sticks his head out, it is correct, although White has destroyed Black's territory, but Black's territory has also been ruined, White doesn't gain anything.];W[ql]
