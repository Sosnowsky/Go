;B[qc];W[pn];B[nq];W[qj]C[W22 is steady move.];B[co]C[Through B23, the opening is very steady.];W[ck]C[W24: In 2005 Ing Cup final, Choi Cheolhan lost to Chang Hao by 3:1.

;W[cn];B[bo];W[cm];B[eo];W[dp];B[cr];W[en];B[dm]C[The shape up to B37 first appeared in one Korean league game between Lee Sedol and Park Jungsang.];W[fn];B[em]C[The turn of B39 is strong. The first fight will start here, both sides are all very difficult. Both players' fighting power are very big. Today, Choi Cheolhan's strategy perhaps is, first take territory then dodge. White's next common move is also make turn. What Chang Hao is thinking?];W[fm]C[W40: White indeed turns.];B[ek]
;W[di]LB[dr:a]C[Through W42, by Choi Cheolhan's style, Black will extend out strongly at 'a'.];B[fl]C[B43: Today, Choi Cheolhan still answers with one common move.];W[fp]C[Through W44, this game perhaps will become a close game. Next Black may jump to 'a'.]LB[hl:a];B[hl]C[Through B45, both sides are very difficult.];W[fi]C[W46 threatens Black in the center and also protects left-side territory.];B[ho];W[hq];B[fc]
;W[dc]C[Through W50, this is a long game.];B[ql];W[pp]C[W52: What is the meaning?];B[qq]LB[fd:a]C[B53: What to do if White presses at 'a' in the upper-left corner? Did Choi Cheolhan miscalculate?];W[pk]C[W54: White doesn't want to give Black ladder head.];B[om];W[pl]C[W56 is territory-damaging, but White doesn't want to be taken advantage in the center.];B[cg]C[Through B57, both sides are difficult to play.];W[df]C[The cap of W58 is very strong.]
;B[eh]C[B59 is also very strong. Choi Cheolhan's style is, not playing simple move in a fight.];W[ej]C[W60: Black looks a little chaotic and not easy to answer.];B[dh]C[B61: After a long meditation, Black finally plays B61.

;W[fj];B[fk]C[The sequence up to B71 is inevitable, White perhaps will play atari next.];W[hk]C[The cut of W72 is good order.];B[hj];W[ik];B[gj];W[ij];B[hi];W[fg];B[ii];W[cj]C[If White dies unconditionally, Black's territory is huge, Chang Hao may have illusions?];B[bi]C[B81: Black overlooks White's intension of fighting a ko.]

;W[of];B[rc];W[bg];B[ef]C[B123 is good timing. W122 looks like a mistake, White can play it anytime.];W[eg];B[dg];W[de]C[W126: Black should reinforce, otherwise will die.];B[ff]C[B127: Is this move working? If so, White is not good. It seems this game will be over soon.];W[cl];B[el];W[gg];B[bh]

;W[fr];B[eq];W[ep];B[fq];W[gq];B[es]C[The sequence up to B175 is inevitable.];W[gp];B[ro]C[B177: This side is big? The bottom looks bigger.];W[lq];B[mq];W[lr];B[eb]C[B181: The game will be decided by how much territory White can enclose in the center.]

;B[lk];W[ib]C[The turn of W196 is very big.];B[db];W[cb];B[lj]C[B199: Black is difficult to give komi.
