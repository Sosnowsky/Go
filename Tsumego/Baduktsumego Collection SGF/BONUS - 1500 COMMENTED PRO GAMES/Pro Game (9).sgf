In the game 5, Fujsawa attacked bravely and exquisitely, and managed to kill Kato's big dragon in an extremely thrilling and dangerous fashion.];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[pk]
;W[nc];B[pf];W[pb];B[qc];W[kc];B[jp]LB[fq:a]C[B11: Black first grabs the big point, placing more emphasis on the right-side "High Chinese Fuseki" . If Black approaches at 'a', then White will pincer at 11, it would lead to a steady and prolonged game.];W[hq];B[ho];W[fq]C[W12 and W14: White aims to take territory first in order to battle with Black's outside influence. Therefore, White makes the one-space extension with W14, and it is the proper play.];B[po]C[B15: It is important for Black to protect the corner. If Black greedily plays at around the tengen area, White can approach at 15 and easily live a group, Black would fail with his big moyo plan.];W[dj]C[W16 is the vital point for Sanrensei, this play is blameless. So far, it forms an imposing opening of the "High Chinese Fuseki" versus the "Sanrensei". The next move will decide the framework of the middle game fight.]
;B[cc]C[Black approaches the corner with B17, it is a play to achieve the balance for the game. Black aims to prevent White from forming a big moyo on the left to the upper side. If Black immediately takes the tengen, it would become a simple game of Black's influence vs White's territory.];W[cd]LB[dc:a]C[W18: The direction of White's blocking is correct, if White blocks at 'a', then Black will crawl and live on the left. Because W10 is in a lower position, so White places great hopes on the left-side moyo.];B[dc];W[ec];B[eb];W[fb]C[The double hane of W22 is inevitable.];B[bd];W[be];B[ce]C[The play of B23 and B25 is correct, Black's strategy of persistently destroying White's moyo on the left is right.];W[ed]
;B[bf];W[bc];B[ae];W[bb]C[Through W30, the fight In the upper left comes to an end, Black makes life with sente on the left side, and basically has restricted White's potential of forming a big territory on the left, Black has achieved his original plan.];B[iq];W[hp];B[io]LB[lp:a][ln:b]C[Black has reinforced the lower side with B31 and B33, which correlates well with B17, aiming to keep the balance for the game. Because White is very thick in the upper left to the top area, now if Black plays at around the tengen to gain influence, White will inevitably invade at 'a', followed by B31 and W 'b', Black has some weak points too, so he cannot kill White and has no assurance of success.];W[kq]LB[jj:a][jl:b]C[W34: White immediately invades into Black's territory, it is a planned move, if White plays at 'a', because Black already has a living group on the left with the sequence following B23, the white tengen stone can only serve as a reduction move and not an expansion to White's own moyo, so it would be 
inefficient. Afterwards, Black needs only to answer at 'b' to secure the big territory on the lower side, White would be very hard to play.]
;B[kp]C[The squashing move of B35 is a clever answer.];W[ir]LB[lq:a][jr:b]C[White has no choice but to hane over with W36, if White extends to 'a' instead, Black would diagonal-attack at 'b', the two white stones would form a clumsy shape.];B[lq];W[jr];B[ld];W[lc];B[nd]LB[jj:a][ne:b]C[After Black obtains sente with B37, B39 and B41 are good moves to expand Black's moyo at the top. If Black simple plays at 'a' to grab the tengen, White can jump to 'b' to enlarge White's moyo at the top as well as restrict Black's development in the lower right, this would make a huge difference from the real game.];W[oc]C[W42: White wants to enclose territory at the maximum limit, showing that White is very confident.]
;B[jj]C[B43 is the central point of the game, Black can grab this point and it can be said that Black's opening is successful.];W[qm]C[White invades right away with W44, it is very ferocious, this is an early game-deciding maneuver! Although this kind of play takes some risk, but if Black couldn't answer properly, Black's big moyo would get completely ruined, White could win the game at one stroke.]
(;B[qk]LB[qo:a][qj:b][pl:c][rk:d][rl:e]C[The stand of B45 is the strongest answer, if Black reinforces the corner at 'a',then W 45, B 'b', W 'c', B 'd' and W 'e', White can make the sabaki play by fighting a ko (see var a).];W[qp]C[W46 is an asking move.];B[qq]C[B47 is strong and rude!];W[qo]C[The simple retreat of W48 is a little questionable, this is the main reason why White sinks into a bitter battle later on.];B[pp]C[In the game, after Black connects with B49, because White couldn't find Black's weakness, it is difficult for White to make life on the spot.];W[jl]C[W50: It is wise of White to start the reduction from outside.]
;B[ll]LB[om:a]C[B51: Black insists on capturing the white stones on the right at a large scale, the attitude is very tough and brutal. In fact, right now Black needs only to secure the big territory on the right by making the knight's move at 'a', Black is already favorable in the game.]
(;W[lm]LB[kk:a][mk:b][kj:c][mi:d]C[W52: If Black encircles the whole right side, White would lose the game for sure, so White has to do all he can to charge ahead. If White simply makes the diagonal's extension at 'a', followed by B 'b', W 'c' and B 'd', Black can secure the right-side big territory, White would be no good (see var a).];B[ml]LB[mm:a]C[When White attaches with W52, the retreat of B53 is a calm and good move. If Black hanes at 'a', White would twist-cut at 53 to stir more troubles, Black instead would be not easy to control the situation.];W[pn]
(;B[nn]LB[om:a][on:b][nm:c]C[After White hangs with W54, the cap of B55 is the right move. If Black knight-attacks at 'a', then W 'b', B 'c' and W 55, White would be easy to make sabaki plays by using W52 (see var a).];W[om];B[pl]C[Black has destroyed White's eye space with B57, it is the most relentless and fierce play! Both sides have no way to back down, a big life-and-death "dragon-killing" fight has officially started.];W[ok]C[The attachment of W58 is the only possible sabaki play.];B[pi]C[The jump of B59 is the correct move, Black seeks not to leave any aji for White to exploit.];W[nm];B[mm];W[nk]
;B[ni];W[mj];B[li]LB[mi:a][lj:b]C[After White doubles up with W62, B63 and B65 are inevitable to seal off White. If Black instead presses at 'a', White needs only to stick his head out by extending at 'b', Black could no longer capture White.];W[mi];B[mh];W[mn];B[ln]LB[km:a]C[The cut of W68 is an asking move, however the atari of B69 is a little doubtful, for Black to atari at 'a' would be better.];W[lj];B[kj]
;W[mo]LB[kk:a]C[B71 is the strongest killing move, but after White extends with W72,  White is left with the ambush maneuver in the center by playing at 'a', the situation becomes chaotic.];B[oo];W[rq];B[rr];W[rl]LB[rn:a][qn:b]C[White goes all out to enlarge his eye space with W74 and W76, it is a common play. If White simply makes the diagonal's extension at 76, then B 'a', W 'b' and B 74, White would be killed easily.];B[rn]C[The striking move of B77 is correct.];W[ro]LB[qn:a][rp:b]C[White hangs with W78 tenaciously, if White simply connects at 'a', then Black could capture one stone at 'b' and kill White.]
;B[sn]LB[sq:a][sp:b][sr:c]C[The stand of B79 is the most ferocious killing move! if Black ataris at 'a', then W 'b', B 'c' and W 79, locally White could live by a ko fight.];W[qn];B[sq];W[sp];B[rp];W[lh];B[ki];W[rq];B[sr];W[nh]
;B[mg]C[The fight in the lower right comes to an end with the sequence from B81 to B87, Black has done all he can to fight back White's sabaki plays, Black is successful in this fight.];W[ng]C[W88 and W90: White launches the last pounding at Black's weakness, the fight over here will decide the game with one action.];B[mf]C[Black  has no choice but to retreat with B91.];W[pg]C[White fails to calculate accurately in the subsequent capturing race, W92 is the losing move of the game!];B[ri]C[B93 is a brilliant move of the most skillful "dragon killer"! In order to calculate precisely all the variations after B93, Fujisawa has pondered for 2 hours and 57 minutes! This is his longest thinking record. B93 has consumed one third of the 9-hour regular time! It is also the move that decides the outcome of this game.];W[qg]C[W94 costs White to think for 1 hour and 55 minutes! But it is too late!];B[oh];W[og];B[rh]C[In the game, B95 and B97 are simple and good moves.];W[rk]

;W[re];B[sg]C[The diagonal's extension of B113 is a good move for reducing liberties. In the capturing race, White is short two liberties.];W[lf]C[W114: White turns to run the capturing race with the upper-right black stones, it is already White's final desperate struggle!];B[nf];W[lg];B[jg];W[jf];B[le];W[kf];B[hj]C[B117 and B121 are steady moves to reinforce the center .];W[of];B[ne]
;W[md];B[pc]LB[qb:a]C[B125: If Black mistakenly blocks at 'a' to reduce the liberties, Black's corner would get killed by shortage of one liberty.];W[qb];B[rb];W[ra];B[sb];W[sd];B[sf]C[After Black tightens the liberties with B131, White has no choice but to concede defeat.])
