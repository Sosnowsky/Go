Translation:GoGameWorld.];B[qd]C[Black is Peng Quan 5P of China];W[pp]C[White is Wang Licheng 9P of Japan];B[dc]C[In the 1st round of the 5th Ing Cup, Peng Quan 5p took Black and defeated O Rissei 9p by 3 points, first winning the game for Chinese Team.];W[df]C[The two-space high approach of W4 is a common play of O Rissei.]
;B[ch]LB[fd:a][ce:b]C[The tight pincer of B5 is perhaps one of Peng Quan's strategies, the normal play is to take the empty corner, or make the knight's move at 'a' or 'b'.];W[dp];B[cn];W[od]C[W6: White occupies the star point then takes tenuki to first approach Black's small point corner with W8, this is an uncommon play.];B[fq];W[eo];B[cq];W[fd]C[The play of W12 is often used in O Rissei's games, he must be relatively familiar with this variation.];B[ee]LB[cd:a][ff:b][cf:c][pf:d]C[B13: Black's steady play is to make the diagonal extension at a', followed by W 'b', B 'c' and W 'd', Black's stones all concentrate on the third line, however White's configuration is very vivid, therefore Black selects the play in the game. However in terms of result, Black's play is not necessarily favorable, the variation over here is still worth more study.]

;B[jd];W[jc]LB[fb:a][gb:b]C[W28: In the past it was regarded that Black can't pincer at 'a', however in this game O Rissei never thinks of spending one move here at 'b'.];B[kd];W[cd];B[cc];W[bd];B[fb];W[gc];B[ec];W[lc]C[As for the result following the jump of W36, White can adequately fight.]
;B[bf];W[cf];B[gb];W[ib]C[W40 trying to obtain sente is not worthwhile.];B[bc]LB[nc:a]C[The block of B41 itself is valuable, the most important is the strike at 'a' becomes very severe, this is perhaps what White has overlooked.];W[di];B[fg];W[fh];B[gh];W[fi];B[nc]
;W[ld]TR[od]C[W48: White can't exert power and can only watch his marked stone being separated, Black's profit is big.];B[nd];W[le];B[ne];W[kf];B[jg];W[lh];B[mb];W[lb];B[hg];W[ob];B[nb]
;W[ck];B[gi]LB[qf:a]C[The press of B61 is a slow move, Black should jump to 'a', which is a huge move!];W[qf]C[In the game, White forces by W62 and presses Black to the second and third line, already reducing the earlier loss to a minimum.];B[oe];W[rd];B[re];W[qe];B[rc];W[pd];B[qc];W[pe]
;B[oc];W[rf];B[sd];W[pi];B[oi];W[pj];B[ef];W[dh];B[be];W[cp];B[dq];W[gp]LB[bq:a]C[The knight's move of W82 is the losing cause of this game, now the common knight's move is already meaningless, White certainly should play hane at 'a', going all out to grab territory is imperative at this situation.]
;B[ep];W[fp];B[eq];W[do];B[fo]C[The cut of B87 is a good move!];W[fn]LB[li:a][dm:b]C[With W88, White loses common senses! Because Black's moves at around 'a' are all sente, then the atari of W88 is pointless. Now White should calmly jump to 'b', this way White's situation wouldn't get deteriorated.];B[li];W[jh];B[go]C[After Black runs out with B91, White is already very difficult to look after both.];W[hp]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.]
;B[gn];W[gm]LB[fm:a]C[W94: If White extends at 'a', after Black presses at 94, White on the board is too thin. In the game, in order to stick the head out, White has to sacrifice three stones, White's loss is heavy!];B[io];W[fm];B[ip];W[bq];B[br];W[if];B[ig];W[jf];B[hf];W[kh]
;B[ih]C[B105 is brilliant to make eyes solidly!];W[jj];B[im];W[nq];B[bp];W[bo];B[aq];W[bn];B[ro];W[qo];B[rp]C[After Black takes the corner territory with B113 and B115, White's territory is already clearly not enough.];W[rn]
