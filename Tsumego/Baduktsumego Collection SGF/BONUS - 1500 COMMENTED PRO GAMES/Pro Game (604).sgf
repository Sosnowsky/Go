Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[pd]C[Gu Li won his first game in main event, and new world champion Park Jungsang didn't seem to give a play to his talent.];W[dd];B[qp];W[dq];B[co]C[B1, B3 and B5 are Gu Li's favorite opening recently.]
;W[ck];B[cf];W[ch];B[gp]C[B9: Black starts to vary, which is Gu Li's new study, in the past it was played one line lower, but the result was not so good. The result in this game is not bad, later on Gu Li perhaps will use it more often.];W[ep];B[kq];W[cp];B[pj];W[op];B[pq]LB[pn:a][qq:b]C[The diagonal of B15 is urgent, if Black makes knight at 'a', White can settle down by entering the corner at 'b' quickly, Black can't be satisfied.]
;W[lo]LB[on:a][qn:b][ko:c]C[W16: White can consider to first play at 'a', after B 'b', then W 'c', this way White's efficiency is higher.];B[jp];W[lq]C[W16 and W18 are slow, here the value is not so big.];B[lr];W[mq];B[pn];W[kn];B[gn];W[en]LB[dn:a]C[W24: For White to reinforce at 'a' cleanly is better.]
;B[dl]LB[fl:a]C[Since White already plays W24, when Black invades with B25, White should counterattack resolutely at 'a'.];W[dk]C[The play of W24 and W26 is not coherent.];B[fl];W[dm]C[After W28, White's shape is weird, here there is some aji left, White is clearly not good.];B[cc]C[Black gets to enter the corner with B29 and is very happy.];W[cd];B[dc];W[ed];B[bd];W[be]
;B[bc];W[ce];B[fc];W[gr];B[in];W[nc];B[oc]C[As to the corner-approach of W40, B41 looks crude but practical in this situation to take territory.];W[nd];B[pf];W[jd];B[mn]C[B45 is the vital point to attack, Gu Li's sharp style is vivid on the board.];W[on]
;B[om];W[po];B[qo];W[pm];B[qn];W[nm];B[ol];W[nn];B[nl];W[mm]TR[mn]C[As to this, White makes Black's territory into real one and incurs a lot of damage in territory, but White is able to capture B45 (the marked black stone) and achieve safety quickly, locally the exchange is about even.];B[nf]LB[qh:a]C[B57: Black is of great momentum, wasn't Gu Li worried about White's invasion at 'a'? Can Black can't capture White? However, Gu Li seems to understand Park Jungsang very well.]
;W[qc];B[pc];W[qd];B[qe];W[oe];B[pe];W[nb];B[ob];W[ml]C[From W58 to W66, White settles the shape quickly, White looks like very confident about his situation, but in fact White's situation is not optimistic.];B[nj];W[hq];B[hp];W[iq]TR[gr]C[W68 and W70 are White's deserved sente advantage after W38.]
;B[ip];W[el]TR[dk][en]C[W72: White still needs to spend another move, we can see the improperness of W24 and W26 (the marked stones).];B[ek];W[em];B[gc];W[ic];B[ef]C[B75 and B77 are common tactic to reduce White's influence.];W[dg];B[df];W[bg];B[fk]
;W[fh];B[cg];W[bf]C[The exchange of B83 and W84 is not to Black's advantage.];B[gf];W[hh]LB[hk:a]TR[cg]C[But with W86 White is too cooperative! If White first attacks Black such as at 'a', B83 (the marked stone) most likely will become a damaging move, this way the situation is still very hard to judge.];B[eh];W[ei];B[fi]TR[cg]C[Black crosscuts sharply with B87 and B89, B83 (the marked stone) becomes an excellent move! White's situation deteriorates quickly.];W[eg]
;B[gh]TR[hh]C[W86 (the marked) is being separated on the outside, White's loss is very big.];W[fg];B[gg];W[gi];B[fj];W[hi];B[ik]C[When W96, Black takes chance and reinforces the big dragon at the bottom with B97, Black's tempo is excellent.];W[if];B[ig]LB[ge:a]C[With B99, Black strengthens the cut at 'a' in sente, which is a common tesuji.];W[hg]
;B[hf];W[jf];B[ff];W[dh];B[kh]TR[ig]C[B105: Black doesn't escape B99 directly, instead Black forces White to capture it inefficiently, so far Gu Li fully takes control of the situation.];W[ij];B[jk];W[hk];B[hl];W[ki];B[li];W[kj]C[White's counterattack from W106 to W112 is meaningless.]
;B[le];W[ld];B[lg]C[B115 again increases 5-6 points to Black's territory on the right, White's territory is completely inadequate.];W[qb];B[rd];W[oa];B[pa];W[na];B[pb];W[jm];B[im];W[jr]C[W124: White seeks a way to concede the game.]
;B[kk]C[After B125, White's tail is being captured, White incurs a big defeat.];W[lj];B[lk];W[mi];B[jg];W[mg];B[lh];W[mj];B[mk];W[ec];B[eb];W[jh];B[ng]
;W[kf];B[lf]C[Gu Li 9p advances to the final sixteen, which will be held on 9/8.])
