;W[dh];B[hd];W[nc];B[pc];W[kd];B[ec];W[eb];B[ed];W[fb];B[cc];W[db];B[ce];W[bc]C[Through W18, it seems Black can fight.]
;B[ch];W[cg];B[ci]C[Black elects to attach under with B19 and draw back with B21,  aiming for White's shape defect of W18.];W[dg];B[cb];W[cd];B[dd];W[bd];B[be];W[bb];B[bg];W[bf];B[cf]
;W[bh];B[af]C[Through B33, an exchange results, Black can be satisfied.];W[dj];B[di];W[ei];B[ej]LB[bj:a][cl:b]C[However, the ensuing B35 and B37 are very questionable! Black should make the diagonal's extension at 'a', then White connects at 35 and Black can fly out at 'b', this way Black would be favorable.];W[cj]C[White starts the sacrifice after W38, placing more importance on the whole game. Now Black becomes thicker and thicker, capturing several remnants is meaningless.];B[bi];W[bj];B[ah]
;W[ek];B[fj];W[fk];B[gj]LB[gk:a]C[B45: Black should hane at 'a'.];W[gk];B[hj];W[hk];B[ik]LB[ij:a]C[The hane of B49 is wrong timing, now Black can only give way by extending at 'a'. When patience is needed, you have to exercise patience.];W[ij];B[il]
;W[hi]C[After White cuts with W50, White is very happy with the hane of W52! Because Black has made several mistakes in the opening, the situation is already not good for Black.];B[fi];W[jj];B[kl];W[lj];B[ih];W[ml];B[ip];W[fq];B[cp]LB[mp:a]C[B61: Black should first defend at 'a'.];W[co]
;B[cm];W[cq];B[dk]LB[np:a]C[Although Black captures three white stones with the sequence after B65, but White gets to strike first at 'a', Black immediately sinks into an impasse.];W[eh];B[fh];W[fg];B[gh];W[hh];B[gg];W[hg];B[gf];W[dl]

;W[kq];B[gm];W[em];B[pm]LB[ho:a]C[B91 is the game-deciding move, the proper move is to strengthen at around 'a' to live.];W[hn]C[The counter-attack of W92 is very severe!];B[ho]C[In fact, the diagonal's extension of B93 doesn't work.];W[hm]LB[in:a]C[W94: If White extends at 'a', Black can't block and would die right away.];B[in];W[qn]
;B[pn];W[hq]LB[ol:a][qk:b]C[W96 and W98: White is overhasty. White should jump to 'a', although Black's big dragon in the center can live, White would be clearly favorable if White just fly down at 'b'.];B[iq];W[hr];B[nm]C[The sabaki play of B101 is brilliant, White actually has no way to kill Black unconditionally.];W[mm];B[mn];W[mo];B[lo];W[nl]

;W[nr];B[ls];W[lq];B[ns]C[Through B123, Black has safely bridged over and is successful in the local fight, however White obtains sente and the game is still favorable for White.];W[qk];B[qm];W[qf];B[qi];W[pj];B[pi];W[of];B[rk]LB[ni:a]C[The attachment of B131 is the last losing move! Now Black can only jump to 'a' to strike first for a chance of winning.]
;W[od]C[White becomes thick after the diagonal's extension of W132.];B[ni]C[The jump of B131 now is one-step slow.];W[im];B[kk];W[lh];B[jn];W[re]C[After the diagonal's extension of W138, Black already has no chance.];B[ob];W[rd];B[rc];W[rb];B[nb]
