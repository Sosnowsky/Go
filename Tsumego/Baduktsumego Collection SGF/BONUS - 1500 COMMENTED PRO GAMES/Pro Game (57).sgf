The reason why this game is of historic significance is that for the first time Chen Zude defeated Japanese professional 9 dan player, although this game was played without komi, but this was the first time for him and also the first time in Chinese Go history that a Chinese player ever beat a Japanese 9 dan. Half stone (one point) victory is too insignificant to mention, however this half stone is indeed heavier than a thousand pounds!];B[pd];W[dc];B[dp]C[B1 and B3: Black selects two opposite-corner stars, this is my favorite opening.];W[qp]C[W2 and W4: White battles with two opposite-corner small points, this is also relatively often seen.];B[ce];W[dh]
;B[df];W[fd];B[cj];W[cd]LB[ch:a][fq:b]C[W10: White simply makes the diagonal's extension, forcing Black to cross over at 'a', quickly settling the shape in the upper left corner, then White gets to approach the corner at 'b'.];B[ch];W[fq];B[dn];W[dr];B[cq];W[iq];B[op]
;W[oq]C[As to the high approach of B17, the attachment is the nicest answer.];B[pp];W[pq];B[qo];W[np]LB[nq:a]C[The hane of W22 is inevitable, extending at 'a' is insipid, White at the bottom will be all in a low position.];B[qq];W[rp];B[qr];W[ro];B[pn]C[Because the ladder is not favorable, Black can only hang with B27.];W[on]
;B[pm];W[no];B[po];W[pr];B[nq];W[nr];B[mq];W[rr];B[mr];W[os]C[So far, the local exchange is a joseki.];B[jp]C[The point of B39 is the vital point to escape.];W[ok]LB[nl:a][pj:b]C[W40 is a good move, if White makes the knight's move at 'a', Black will make the extension at 'b', White is clearly no good.]
;B[ol];W[nl];B[nm];W[lp];B[lo]LB[kq:a]C[B45 is a tesuji, answering at 'a' will sink into passivity. Now Sugiuchi starts pondering for the first time, perhaps he didn't expect Black will play such a strong move as B45.];W[mp]C[W46: White has to connect!
];B[kq];W[ip];B[nn];W[ko];B[jo]
;W[kn];B[pk]LB[ml:a]C[B53 is not right, Black should atari at 'a'.];W[nk];B[pj]LB[pi:a]C[The extension of B55 is heavy, Black should jump to 'a'.];W[jr]C[W56: White starts to attack Black at the bottom.];B[kp];W[ln];B[mn];W[mo]
;B[lq];W[kl]C[W62 forms a good shape, however Black' route for running out at the bottom is very narrow, this is caused by the improperness of B53.];B[oo];W[lo];B[io]LB[hn:a]C[The turn of B65 is slow, Black certainly should make the knight's move at 'a'.];W[ql];B[pl];W[gn]C[W68 is a good move to separate the lower and left Black.];B[ho];W[go];B[il]
;W[ni];B[jm]LB[im:a]C[B73: Black has to reinforce with one more move in order to guard against the cut at 'a', this is very painful.];W[mm];B[om];W[qf]C[After taking sente, White approaches the corner with W76, now White has already taken control of the game.];B[oh]C[B77: Black needs to counterattack.];W[of];B[nh];W[mh];B[mg];W[lg]LB[lh:a][pg:b][ne:c]C[The double hane of W82 is strong, if White extends at 'a', Black will peep at 'b' with sente, then seal off White at 'c'.]

;W[md];B[jf];W[jh];B[re];W[jd]LB[ng:a]C[Comparing B99 with W100, it seems the value of W100 is bigger. After W100, Black is very difficult. The current situation is, Black is not leading in territory, Black also has a cut at 'a' in the upper right, and Black in the lower is being threatened too. Handling the lower Black is clearly imperative, however simply escaping is hard to win the game, it seems Black has to adopt an unusual tactic.];B[fm]C[In the game, Black elects to play the fierce knight's move of B101.];W[gm];B[ij];W[hh];B[gp];W[fp]
;B[hp];W[hr];B[fo]C[Through the cut of B109, Black attacks in order to defend.];W[dj];B[ci];W[ng]C[The cut of W112 is inevitable. Because obviously the four black stones can't be killed by White, however White can obtain profit by attacking Black, so the fight over here is very important to the outcome of the game.];B[id]C[The attachment of B27 is a way to manage and settle Black himself.];W[jc]C[The purpose of W114 is not allowing Black to borrow strength.];B[hf];W[ff];B[ic]LB[gg:a]C[B117: If Black makes the diagonal's extension at 'a', White can start a two-pronged attack on the upper and lower black groups, Black will be hard to handle, in the game, B117 is a strong move.]
;W[pb]C[W118 is a good move.];B[qb]C[B119: Black has no choice but to play the attachment.];W[ie];B[he];W[if];B[ig];W[je];B[ih];W[hg];B[jg];W[kf];B[ii]C[Both sides don't have much choice with the sequence from B123 to B129.]
;W[kg]LB[gf:a]C[W130 is not good, White should play at 'a'.];B[gg];W[gh];B[fh];W[gi];B[gd];W[gf];B[fc];W[ge];B[hd];W[gc]C[After the atari of W138 and the cut of W140, it already leads to a situation where White has to kill Black in order to win the game.]
;B[ed];W[fe];B[ec];W[ib];B[dd]C[Through B145, an exchange has resulted, White has captured six black stones, Black obtains the upper left corner, the losses and gains are about even, the game becomes very close. However because Sugiuchi 9p has used a lot of time in the middle game, now he is already in overtime.];W[fn];B[gj];W[eo];B[fi];W[fg];B[em];W[fj];B[fk]

;B[cr];W[dq]LB[rn:a]C[As to the block of B67, The squeezing move of W68 is the losing move. White should play at 'a', this way White would still have a chance.];B[ds];W[er];B[hi];W[hc];B[rn];W[cp];B[bp];W[co];B[bo];W[do]

;B[be]LB[cg:a]C[B257: Even if Black connects at 'a', White doesn't have any maneuver in the upper left corner. However, at that time I was in the final moment of overtime and afraid that if I had miscalculated, all the previous efforts would be wasted. The most important is that I was sure that Black's victory already can't be altered. Therefore, Black plays the steady move of B257, rather inflicting a two-point loss and reducing Black's advantage to a minimum limit ... half stone.

This is the first time I beat a Japanese 9p, that day I would never forget ... 1963-09-27.];W[bi];B[cg];W[sp];B[sn];W[qe];B[sd];W[sh];B[si];W[sg];B[ms];W[ns]
