Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[Among Lee Minjin's five consecutive wins, most were turnaround games in second half. However, we need to know, turning the game around itself is one important skill. Just because you can correctly put pressure on them, your opponents may make mistakes.];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[fc];W[cf]
;B[kc];W[po];B[qm];W[qq];B[qr]LB[qp:a]C[B11: Black normally will play joseki at 'a', the play in the game is rarely seen.];W[qp];B[or];W[on];B[om]LB[np:a][pl:b]C[B15 is the right move. If Black elects to play joseki at 'a', White will make knight at 'b', Black's moyo at top and right side will be ruined, it is clearly not good.]
;W[nm];B[ol];W[nq];B[mq];W[mp];B[mr];W[lp];B[kq];W[od]LB[qf:a]C[The direction of W24 is wrong. The center point of Black's moyo is on the right side, White certainly should invade the right side at 'a'.];B[pf];W[of];B[og]
;W[qc];B[rc];W[rd];B[qe];W[rb];B[pc]C[Black's efficiency on the right side is too high, Black is smooth.];W[qb];B[nl]LB[pd:a]C[B35: Black is alert, this is strategically vital point and much bigger than taking small local profit at 'a'.];W[re];B[mm]C[B37: Black takes a big risk, which is unnecessary.];W[nn]C[W38: White can take risk and enter into Black's big territory on the right side, White at bottom is not easy to die.]
;B[rf];W[ng];B[oh];W[hd];B[fe];W[hf];B[fg];W[ec];B[gb];W[ic];B[eb]C[B47 and B49 are good moves, Black's shape is not bad.];W[db];B[cc]
;W[ea]LB[dc:a][cb:b]C[If W52 at 'a', when B 'b', White can no longer play W52.];B[dc]C[Of course, White will counterattack with B53, however White also has no other choices.];W[ed];B[fb];W[cd];B[cb]C[Through B57, Black takes the corner in sente and can be satisfied.];W[fd];B[cn];W[cl];B[en]
;W[co];B[bn];W[el]LB[fq:a][dk:b]C[W62 and W64 are good feeling! If White answers normally at 'a', Black will cap at 'b', White's influence at top can't be put into good use.];B[fp];W[fq];B[cq]LB[gq:a]C[B67 is unreasonable! Black should play at 'a'.];W[dq];B[gq];W[gp]
;B[fo];W[fr]LB[hq:a]C[W72 is slow. White should first play atari at 'a', making Black heavy. This way Black can't turn body around, White can fight.];B[bp]C[B73: Black is alert and cleverly turns the body around.];W[cp];B[br];W[cr];B[bq];W[hp];B[dr];W[er];B[cs]
;W[iq];B[kp];W[ko];B[jo];W[kn];B[jn];W[jp]LB[km:a]C[W88 is too brave and strong. White should simply retreat at 'a'.];B[jr];W[jm];B[hn];W[ir];B[km]C[After the cut of B93, Black builds thick influence in the center. Black takes advantage just by this influence.]

;B[fj];W[fm];B[cj]C[B107 and B109 are light and nimble.];W[im]C[W110: White only captures two stones, not interesting.];B[pd];W[pb];B[oc]C[After B113, Black takes a big lead in territory.];W[ch];B[hg]C[Only if Black handles this group well, Black will keep advantage.];W[ig];B[gf]LB[hh:a]C[But at this crucial moment, Black makes trouble for herself. There is nothing wrong if Black just simply extends at 'a'.]
;W[hh];B[he];W[gg];B[if];W[gd];B[hg];W[ms]C[In the game, it leads to an exchange.];B[gh]C[Black is happy to take ponnuki, but Black's moyo in the center is open from two sides, it is difficult to enclose territory.];W[rq]C[In comparison, White kills Black at bottom and is more substantial. The situation becomes chaotic.];B[os]LB[ps:a]C[B127: Black should reserve the tactic of fighting a ko at 'a'.]
;W[sr]C[In the game, Black dies unconditionally, the situation has been turned around.];B[in];W[go];B[jq];W[ip];B[ik];W[hk];B[hj];W[ij];B[ii];W[kd];B[lc];W[je]
