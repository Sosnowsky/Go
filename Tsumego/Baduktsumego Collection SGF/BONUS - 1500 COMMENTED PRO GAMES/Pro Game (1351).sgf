;W[qh];B[no];W[mo]C[B7: Black seeks variation, the common move is to make diagonal at 'a'. In the real game, through W20, Black appears a little over-concentrated, with W20 White can also hang at 22, Black is even more difficult to handle. Since W22 is sente, Black can only play B21 as in the game to wait for chance patiently.]LB[po:a];B[nq];W[mp];B[mr];W[lr];B[lq];W[mq]C[W22: White can also hang at 28, in the real game W26 is a big mistake! White certainly should play atari at 28 simply, after Black takes one stone with B27, White incurs loss.

;B[ls];W[ko];B[iq];W[nn];B[mm];W[pn]C[White cuts with W36, Black is painful.];B[pr];W[km];B[mk];W[gq]C[W40 is wrong direction, with W40 White certainly should control the center by jumping to 'a'.]LB[kk:a];B[io]C[After Black jumps out with B41, White needs to guard against Black's diagonal-cut.]

;B[kk]C[When Black takes the vital point with B55, offense and defense reverse roles.];W[im];B[qj];W[rj];B[gp];W[fp];B[jn]C[After the hane of B59, the diagonal cut of B61 is very severe!];W[kn];B[jm];W[ip];B[ho];W[kl]
;B[jl];W[ll]C[This must be Cho "Fast Gun" unexpected strong move, White has to play damaging moves with W66 and W68 consecutively in order to extend liberties.];B[nj];W[hp];B[go];W[ns];B[eq];W[fq];B[hs];W[gr];B[fo];W[ep];B[lo]C[The worse thing is, in order to prevent Black from playing hane here and making a ko, White has to play W72 but overlooks Black's wedge of B79, White collapses immediately!]
;W[lp];B[kq]C[Of course, with W72 even if plays at 81, it will form a multi-stage ko, White is also not good.];W[ms];B[kp];W[lr];B[jo];W[ks];B[bp];W[cm];B[dn];W[cq];B[bq];W[cr]
