I remember it was a very happy journey at the time when I participated in the Fujitsu Cup (in 1991). Now let's take a look at the game between O Rissei and Cho Hunhyun.];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[qo]C[The moves of B1, B3 and B5 form the "Kobayashi Style", which is the masterpiece of the Japanese Kobayashi Koichi 9p.]
