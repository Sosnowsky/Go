Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[A new term of LG Cup starts again, even if he is the champion of last term, Gu Li has to start from round 1.];W[pp];B[dc];W[dp];B[cn]
;W[fq];B[ci];W[od]C[As to the corner-approach of W8, this variation was already played many times, but high hands are trying for new variations all the time.];B[mc];W[qc];B[pc];W[pd];B[oc];W[nc];B[nd];W[nb];B[qb];W[rc]
;B[ob];W[qe];B[mb];W[ne];B[md];W[de];B[fd];W[fe];B[ge];W[cc];B[cb];W[db];B[cd]
;W[ec];B[bc];W[dd];B[ff];W[cc];B[qn]C[When White takes the ko with W36, the corner-approach of B37 as a ko threat is a new move.];W[np];B[dc]C[In the upper-left corner, even if playing one more move, Black still couldn't kill White.];W[qo]C[The diagonal-hit of W40 is again a new shape.];B[ce];W[df];B[eh]
;W[cc];B[oq]C[However, the ko threat of B45 is not severe.];W[fc]C[White crawls out with W46, Black has no severe follow-up tactic.];B[op];W[oo];B[pq];W[nq];B[no];W[rp];B[mo];W[nr];B[on]
;W[po];B[pn];W[rn];B[rm];W[qq]C[From B47 to W60, Black incurs loss, White is taking a lead in the game very early on.];B[ph];W[of];B[ng]LB[gd:a]C[B63: Black is not hurry to play this move, but in the upper-left corner, Black also doesn't have any other good move to play, to simply connect at 'a' is too inconvenient, so Black can only play this way.];W[gd];B[hd];W[ed]
;B[bg];W[hc]C[White's sequence from W64 to W68 is smooth.];B[sn];W[ro];B[qg];W[rf];B[en]C[B73: Black can only expand his influence, now let's see how big Black's potential is in the center.];W[cg];B[ch];W[bf];B[cf];W[dg]
;B[be];W[dh];B[di];W[ei]C[White directly charges with the sequence from W74 to W82, this is Gu Li's style.];B[fh]LB[ej:a][fi:b][fj:c]C[B83 is unreasonable, although Black's situation is not good, Black still can only play atari at 'a', after W 'b', then play at 'c', this way Black still can do something on the right side.];W[ej];B[dk]LB[gj:a]C[B85: Black should make the knight's move at 'a'!];W[gi]
;B[fi];W[nn]C[W86 and W88 makes Black very difficult, Black is hard to look after both sides.];B[ln]LB[pl:a]C[When B89, Black overlooks the vital point of W 'a', it seems B89 is again mistake! Black should play at 'a'.];W[pl];B[qm];W[nm];B[qk];W[lm];B[km];W[ll];B[jn]
;W[oj];B[nl]C[Next Black attaches with B99 strongly.];W[om];B[pj];W[kl];B[jl];W[jk];B[kk]C[Black cuts with B105.];W[ko];B[kn];W[il]C[But after White peeps with W106, White plays atari of W108, Black is very painful!];B[jm]
;W[pk];B[qj];W[nk];B[kj];W[mj];B[gj]C[When B115, Black is already very hard to handle, since Black itself has many defects.];W[jj];B[ki];W[hj];B[hn];W[ih]C[White flies out with W120, Black already can't attack White.];B[ni]
;W[ml];B[gh]LB[kh:a][gk:b]C[B123 is a determined move, however White gets to attach out at 'a' and is left with the counterattack at 'b'. Here Black can only tolerate at 'b' even in an unfavorable situation.];W[kh];B[lh];W[kg];B[cq];W[cp];B[bp];W[gk];B[fj];W[fl]
;B[fk]C[After this move, it is time for lunch break.];W[gl];B[iq]C[B135: Black can only play this way.];W[fn]C[Following W136, White cleverly escapes two stones in the center.];B[fo];W[dq];B[br];W[cr];B[bq];W[eo];B[do];W[ep]
;B[fm];W[em];B[gn];W[ek];B[dl]LB[gr:a]C[B149: Black's last chance is to make the knight's move at 'a', in the real game Black's situation is already very bad.];W[el];B[dn];W[hr];B[ig];W[he];B[gf];W[id]
;B[hi];W[ii];B[hk];W[ij];B[hh];W[hg];B[hf];W[if];B[gg];W[li];B[ir];W[er];B[rb]

;B[dc];W[dj];B[cj];W[ck]LB[ai:a]C[In the ko fight, W238 is a clever move! After this cut, White is left with the brilliant diagonal move at 'a', Black can't continue the game.];B[cl];W[cc];B[ca];W[ac];B[dc];W[bo];B[co];W[cc]C[Gu Li advances to the final sixteen, the round 2 will take place on 5/17.]
