Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[On 8/18, in the 2nd Zhonghuan Cup, Lee Sedol 9p defeated Hane Naoki 9p and advanced to the final, he will compete with Choi Cheolhan 9p for the champion who beat Yoda Norimoto 9p.];W[dc];B[dq]C[Now Lee Sedol is unstoppable, but there are a lot of defects in his games, he still has some distance comparing with Lee Changho when nobody can find any problems in Lee Changho's games. The problem right now is, who can stop Lee Sedol?];W[pp];B[ce]
;W[dn];B[co];W[dh];B[ed];W[ec];B[fd];W[gc];B[cc];W[gd];B[dd];W[gf];B[oc]LB[fc:a][cb:b]C[B17 is rarely seen, the joseki is for Black to push at 'a' then descend at 'b'. In this game, White hanes in sente, it is too big, Black is not successful.]
;W[cb];B[bc];W[fc]LB[cn:a]C[W20 is hard to understand, in the lower left corner,  'a' is clearly the vital point.];B[do];W[qj];B[nq];W[pn];B[jp];W[qf]LB[lq:a]C[Since B25 is in high position, White has the mindset to invade at 'a' with W26, since White is favorable in the ladder, Black is not easy to handle.];B[no]
;W[pr];B[nm]C[B27 and W29: Black gets to jump again, Black's configuration at the bottom is vivid, Black is leading in the opening.];W[md]LB[mc:a]C[W30 is weird, not clear about its purpose, to play at 'a' is common.];B[mc]C[B31: The twist-cut is Lee Sedol's first-rated good move.];W[lc];B[ld];W[me];B[mb];W[kc];B[oe];W[rd]
;B[rc];W[cg]LB[en:a][fn:b]C[Since B 'a' at the bottom is very big, White must obtain sente. White takes tenuki strongly with W40, it is correct, but to play here is a bad move! White certainly should jump to 'b'.];B[en];W[bb];B[df];W[lq]C[After B41, White invades with W44, White is clearly one-step slow.];B[lp];W[kq];B[jq];W[nr]
;B[ql]C[The invasion of B49 is severe! This is the reserved tactic of B29.];W[ol];B[pk];W[pi];B[pm]C[B53 is a good move! After Black connects together, Black's advantage becomes more obvious.];W[qn];B[om];W[pd]C[Following W56, White makes life in the corner and gains some profit, but White is damaged on the outside, Hane is already angry.];B[pe];W[qc];B[qe];W[rb]
;B[re];W[sc];B[pb];W[qb];B[pc];W[og];B[kd];W[jc];B[mf];W[lf];B[mg]LB[lg:a][nf:b][ne:c][kf:d][le:e][jh:f]C[B71 is not good, White connects together and it has a big impact on the lower-side moyo, Black should play hane at 'a', White can only atari at 'b', next B71, W 'c', B 'd', W 'e' and B 'f', this way White plays all dame moves, Black is very favorable.]
;W[lg];B[mh];W[lh];B[mi];W[rk];B[rl];W[rh];B[mr]C[B79 is clever!];W[mq];B[or];W[np]LB[oq:a]C[W82: Since White is not favorable in ko threats, White can't initiate the ko at 'a', White is about to collapse.]
;B[ns];W[mp];B[pq]LB[op:a][oq:b][oo:c][mo:d]C[But B85 is inexplicable, if White wedges at 'a', next W85, B 'b', W 'c' and B 'd', this way how White to resist?];W[qq];B[oq];W[op];B[qr];W[rr];B[ps]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.]
;W[dl]C[In the game, Black ends in gote, White gets to play W92, Black incurs loss.];B[ff]LB[fl:a]C[B93: Black should play at 'a'.];W[fl]C[W94 is the vital point for reduction and expansion, after W94, the situation becomes closer.];B[ri];W[rf];B[se];W[qi];B[gg];W[hf];B[kp];W[rp]
;B[sd];W[bf];B[be];W[cn];B[cl]LB[bn:a]C[B107: Black seems over brave! In fact if Black plays at 'a' steadily, Black's situation is also not bad.];W[bn];B[dj]LB[dm:a]C[If Black loses this game, B109 will be the losing move, Black should wedge at 'a'.];W[em];B[fn]C[B111: Lee Sedol really plays fire! Hane may never saw this kind of move!]
;W[fh]C[W112 is steady, next although Black destroys White's territory, but at the bottom Black's own territory also disappears, the situation has been turned around.];B[fj];W[fg];B[hj];W[hl];B[ci];W[bo];B[dk];W[fe]LB[dg:a][ef:b][gi:c][gj:d][cp:e]C[W120 is miscalculation! In fact White only needs to simply play at 'a' , B 'b', W 'c', B 'd' and W 'e', White is favorable.]
;B[eh]C[B121 is clever! White incurs loss in the following exchange, the situation is not clear.];W[ei];B[eg];W[fi];B[di];W[ef];B[dg];W[cp];B[dp];W[cq];B[cr];W[br];B[bq]

;W[hp]LB[jj:a]C[W160 is the losing move! White certainly should take the vital point at 'a', this way Black is in a bitter battle.];B[jd];W[id];B[jf];W[je];B[ke];W[kf];B[ie];W[le];B[je];W[jj];B[hk]
;W[ji];B[ih];W[jl];B[im];W[il];B[gm];W[gl]C[W178 should also be reserved, this way the game is still not clear.];B[fk];W[hm];B[hq]C[In the real game, Black crosses over with B181 and steps over crisis, Black is a little favorable, till the end.];W[gq];B[gp]
