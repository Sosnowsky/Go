Copyright by gogameworld.com and weiqi.tom.com.];B[pd];W[dp]C[In the first game, Lee Sedol 3p killed Lee Changho's big dragon and leads the best-of-5 by 1:0.];B[pq]C[After that game, Lee Changho 9p admitted he had neglected the move 81 (please see the game 1).];W[dd];B[qk]C[In this game, Lee Changho elects to play "Chinese Fuseki".]
;W[gq]LB[mp:a][nc:b]C[The large knight's move of W6 is rarely seen, the usual play is to approach the corner at around 'a' or 'b' to contain the development of "Chinese Fuseki".];B[nc];W[fc]C[W6 and W8 are very solid.];B[cj]
(;W[ch]LB[cl:a][cg:b][ce:c][cq:d]C[W10: If White makes the extension at 'a', then after B 'b' and W 'c', Black would happily enter the corner at 'd' (see var a).];B[cm];W[co];B[ej];W[jd]C[Through 14, the opening is very steady, but due to Lee Sedol's fierce and ferocious style, he definitely wouldn't continue to play steadily like this, as he always tries to "provoke and make trouble". However, at any rate, so far, it is Lee Changho's favorite, simple and thick opening.];B[iq]LB[cd:a]C[B15: The attachment at 'a' is also a powerful move, perhaps Lee 9p doesn't want to invoke a fight.];W[lp]
;B[io];W[ln]LB[oo:a]C[W18 at 'a' is more initiative.];B[po];W[go]C[After White jumps with W20 and secures the lower left corner, White is leading in territory.];B[ko];W[lo];B[im];W[ll];B[lj]LB[jl:a][km:b][ol:c][pm:d][oj:e]C[B25: Black starts attacking White, if Black can obtain some profit by attack, Black will gain the upper hand. After B25, if White jumps to 'a', then B 'b' is a good move; Although White can choose W 'c', B 'd' and W 'e' to run out, but Black can take the chance to enclose the lower right territory, it is not what White would like.]
;W[ok]
(;B[qm]LB[pm:a][om:b][on:c][kk:d][nl:e]C[B27 is a common play, if Black makes the knight's move at 'a' , then after W 'b', B 'c', and W 'd', one black stone in the center would be isolated (see var a), it seems that the knight's move at 'a' is more helpful to Black's territory on the side. In addition, for Black to separate White at 'e' is also possible.];W[kk];B[ik];W[kj];B[ii]C[B31: Black reinforces the center.];W[ce]LB[li:a][cf:b]C[W32: If White strengthens at 'a', then Black would invade at 'b'. A lot of players have gathered in the study room, Rui Naiwei 9p thinks Black is thicker, she prefers Black. Now White has tightly controlled two left corners and White is leading in territory, but White's center is weaker.]
;B[qe]LB[lh:a][nj:b][li:c][oi:d]C[B33: Black protects the corner to keep balance in territory, now the jump to 'a' or 'b' is also a good spot for attack. After B33, for White to defend at 'c' is very thick, to jump at 'd' is a very big move too.];W[mc]LB[pj:a]C[W34: White aims to first settle the upper side then strengthen the center, but this move seems unreasonable, simple making the diagonal extension at 'a' is the proper play.];B[mb];W[nb]C[W36 is inexplicable.];B[lb]LB[oc:a][nd:b][pb:c][od:d][rc:e][na:f][ob:g][rd:h][qc:i]C[After B37, if White ataris at 'a', then B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f', W 'g', B 'h' and W 'i' (see var a), although White can make life in the corner, but his center would become very dangerous, Lee Sedol has played W36 very fast, not sure over here what good maneuver he has.]

(;W[jb]C[W38: White seems to have no other choice, then Lee Sedol perhaps lacks consideration for W34 and W36.];B[nd]C[After Black reinforces with 39, the upper right corner becomes Black's solid territory, Lee Sedol has suffered some losses in this area.];W[pj];B[qj];W[ob];B[ld]C[After B43, it seems that White could live with a ko in the upper right corner.];W[pi]C[W44 is a thick play.];B[cc]LB[er:a]C[Black is still left with some maneuvers in the two left corners, for instance, in the lower left, B 'a' is painful for White.];W[bd]C[After this move, it is time for noon break. Lee Sedol has used 1 hour and 50 minutes, Lee Changho 1 hour and 10 minutes.

;B[hf]LB[eh:a][er:b]C[B47 is a surprising move, so far in the study room pros have only discussed the option of B 'a' or B 'b'.];W[kh]LB[eh:a]TR[nb]C[W48 is a solid move, Black has flattened White's territory at the top, now the point 'a' is still the vital spot. Because of the mistake of the marked white stone, so far the game is slightly favorable for Black, but White also has obtained the jump of 38, there are still many unsettled areas on the board, so the game is still far from over.]
(;B[gc]LB[er:a][dr:b][eq:c][dq:d][gr:e][fq:f][bq:g]C[B49: Black can also consider to reduce at 'a', if W 'b', then B 'c', W 'd' and B 'e', Black is favorable (see var a), this sequence was suggested by Yoo Changhyeok 9p. Moreover,  when B 'a', if White tries to kill at 'f', Black can make the brilliant move at 'g', it would be bad for White (see var b).];W[gd];B[hc];W[fb]LB[hd:a]C[W52 is the appropriate move, if White presses at 'a', then B 52, White has no way to kill Black.];B[hd]
;W[ge];B[he]C[While his center has not become weaker, Black has messed up White's top territory, Black has scored again.];W[jf];B[fg]C[B57 is a good move, if White grabs this spot, Black would become very thin.];W[fl];B[gk]LB[qh:a]C[B59 is Lee Changho's top-notch patient play, now the jump move at 'a' is also very big.];W[qg]LB[qf:a][re:b][er:c][qc:d][pc:e][rd:f]C[W60 is a huge move, and White also aims to ruin Black's upper right corner. Lee Changho is pondering, now if Black plays at either 'a' or 'b', White then has no follow-up tactics in the corner, if Black tenukis, for example, to play at 'c', then after W 'd', B 'e' and W 'f', Black's corner would get wrecked.]

(;B[cq]LB[re:a][dl:b][cl:c][dk:d][dj:e][ck:f][bk:g][bj:h][bi:i][bl:j][aj:k][bm:l]C[B61: If Black stands at 'a' to protect the corner, then after W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 'e', W 'f', B 'g', W 'h', B 'i', W 'j', B 'k' and W 'l', the two black stones will be killed (see var a), thus the game would be to White's advantage.];W[dq]LB[bp:a][bo:b][dr:c][br:d][cr:e][er:f][bs:g]C[After the block of W62, with the sequence of B 'a', W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 'e', W 'f' and B 'g', Black can live (see var a).]

(;B[dg];W[qc]LB[cg:a]C[Normally White certainly should connect back at 'a', White's tenuki can be explained as: Lee Sedol doesn't think that he is in a favorable situation, so he starts the counterattack with W64.];B[pc];W[rd];B[pb];W[re];B[cg]C[The block of B69 is very big, this can be calculated by comparing territorial differences for both sides.];W[bf];B[bo];W[bp];B[bn]C[B71 and B73: Black starts the endgame.]
;W[pr];B[qr];W[oq];B[pp]C[So far Lee Changho still has 1 hour left in the regular time, Lee Sedol only 38 minutes.];W[bq]C[W78 is the biggest endgame on the board.];B[bg];W[qb]C[B79 and W80 are also the  biggest endgames. Now White has about 52 points, Black has about 62 points, the komi is 6.5 points, so Black is leading.];B[qa];W[ra];B[pa];W[dl]LB[mg:a][em:b]C[W84: White really wants to enclose the center territory by the knight's move at 'a', but B 'b' is very big too.]
;B[dm];W[em];B[gr];W[fr];B[hq];W[gp]LB[mq:a]C[After B87 and B89, B 'a' becomes very severe.];B[lr]C[The process of this game is completely different from that of the first game, so far in this game, basically there is no big fight, the game has now entered into the endgame phase.];W[nr];B[ee];W[ed];B[mg]C[W95,  which reduces the potential of White's center territory, is the biggest move on the board.]

(;W[hl]LB[kp:a][jq:b][hr:c][ir:d][gs:e][gl:f][mh:g]C[W96 is questionable, White should turn at 'a', B 'b' is inevitable, then W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f' and W 'g', this way White can fight, this variation was suggested by Yoo Changhyeok 9p (see var a).];B[gl]
(;W[hm]LB[gm:a][fj:b][fk:c][ek:d][dk:e][ck:f]C[W98: White should block at 'a', then B 98, W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 'e' and W 'f', a ko fight results, this way Black also has some apprehensions (see var a).];B[gm];W[hn];B[kp];W[dn]C[W102 is important, White must link back his three stones.];B[cl];W[dk]
;B[dj];W[hr];B[ir];W[gs]C[White takes one black stone with W108, it is very big, however the game is still a little favorable for Black.];B[lq];W[np];B[no];W[nn];B[ps]C[For the result up to 113, White can not be satisfied.];W[ag];B[ah];W[af]
;B[bh];W[pl];B[ql];W[mh]LB[os:a][qs:b][il:c]C[W120 is not urgent, White should play at 'a' to start a ko fight, if Black connects at 'b' docilely, then White can push at 'c', thus the outcome of the game is still hard to guess.];B[nh];W[mi]LB[mq:a][lg:b][rh:c]C[Black can capture the two white stones at a', the points 'b' and 'c' are also good spots.];B[mq]

(;W[nq]LB[mp:a][op:b][or:c][ng:d]C[W124: White should connect at 'a', followed by B 124, W 'b', B 'c' and W 'd', this is obviously better than the real game (see var a).];B[mp];W[oo];B[mo];W[op];B[mn];W[pn];B[qn];W[mm]LB[kn:a]C[Through 132, Black's atari at 'a' becomes sente, Black becomes very thick.]
;B[lg];W[os]C[W134 is the game-deciding move in an unfavorable situation.];B[or];W[kc];B[lc];W[pr];B[kg];W[qs]C[W140 may be White's last counterattack maneuver.];B[gb]C[B141: Black has captured four white stones and achieved a big profit, White already has no chance to win.];W[rp];B[rq];W[rr]
;B[qq];W[sq];B[qo];W[ij];B[kn]C[The best-of-5 series is now tied at 1:1, the game 3 will take place on 3/25.])
