Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[pd]C[Congratulations to Gu Li's five consecutive titles, this is not easy to achieve!];W[dd]C[In this game, the challenger Liu Shizhen's situation was once not bad, but in the second half he played not well and lost a good chance to win the title.];B[qp];W[dp];B[op]C[The opening up to B5 is very popular nowadays.]
;W[jq];B[lq];W[qj];B[fc];W[cf];B[qh];W[ec]C[W12: White is not willing to follow opponents, White's play is bold, saw Lee Sedol play this way the earliest.];B[jd];W[fd];B[ql]C[However, Black takes the vital point with B15 and has nothing to complain.];W[qf];B[qd]C[B17 is strong move, not giving White any chance to turn body around, Black stresses on attacking the whole white group.]
;W[rh];B[rg];W[qg];B[ri];W[ph];B[qi];W[pi];B[rf]LB[rj:a][of:b]C[B25 is good move, if Black plays at 'a' normally, White will take 'b', Black will lose tactic to attack.];W[rj];B[sh];W[pj]
;B[og]C[B29 is vital point.];W[pg]C[White's shape is heavy and overly concentrated.];B[of]C[Black takes initiative.];W[pl]LB[qm:a]C[W32 at 'a' is a little better.];B[qm];W[mi]LB[mj:a]C[The shape of W34 is not right, to play at 'a' is relatively better.];B[mk]C[B35 is good move! Hitting White's vital point, White is painful.];W[nk]C[W36: White fights strongly.]
;B[nl]C[Black has more stones in surroundings and certainly is not fearful of fight.];W[ml];B[lk];W[nj];B[ol];W[qq]C[W42 is a probe.];B[mm]C[B43: Black takes tenuki and it is simply powerful move.];W[lh]C[White's big dragon in the center becomes heavier, Black is favorable.];B[fq];W[cn];B[le]
;W[rp];B[qo]LB[pq:a]C[B49: For Black to play at 'a' and obtain sente is better.];W[hq];B[dq]LB[dr:a][cq:b][ep:c]C[B51: Black can consider to play at 'a', next W 'b' and B 'c'.];W[cq];B[cr];W[eq];B[dr]
;W[ep];B[cp];W[bq];B[bp];W[br];B[bs];W[er]C[White settles shape in sente and Black is a little dissatisfied.];B[aq]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.

Black has used 1 hour and 26 minutes.
White 1 hour and 2 minutes.];W[jh];B[ll]LB[ic:a][ip:b]C[Since the value at 'a' on the upper side is very big, with B65 Black can consider to tangle White at 'b', not allowing White take tenuki easily.]
;W[ic];B[jc];W[jb];B[kb];W[ib];B[cc]C[B71 is good order, Black may not have chance to play this move later on.];W[db];B[gd]LB[id:a][hd:b][he:c][hh:d]C[Perhaps Black feels the last several moves are slow, with B73 Black wants to play more relentlessly. In fact it is not necessary, Black can simply play at 'a', next W 'b', B 'c', W73 and B 'd', this way Black's situation is very good.];W[id]C[White's counterattack of W74 is inevitable.]

;W[hh];B[gf];W[mg];B[nh];W[kj];B[mf];W[ka];B[lb]C[Through B95, White obtains sente, Black incurs loss.];W[pr]C[The situation becomes closer.];B[cg]LB[hj:a]C[Black's attacking direction following B97 is wrong, Black should attack at 'a', allowing White to play inside.];W[dg]

;W[jl]C[Through W134, originally thin White encloses territory in the center, White's stone efficiency is too high.];B[jn];W[pp];B[po];W[kp]C[When W138, Black is already not easy to handle.];B[kn]LB[lo:a]C[The resistance of B139 is too simple. If B139 at 'a', Black can still hold for a while.];W[lo];B[no];W[mp];B[np];W[ln]
;B[km];W[kl]C[W146: White obtains sente.];B[lm];W[im]C[W148: White takes chance to enclose territory.];B[in]C[Black's defeat has already been decided.];W[hn];B[ip];W[co];B[bo];W[hp];B[dl];W[el]
