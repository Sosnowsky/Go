;B[hp];W[fo];B[ho];W[jo];B[kp];W[jp];B[in]C[Black not only tries to escape but also aims to attack White at the bottom.];W[km];B[il];W[cq];B[dg];W[dc];B[bb]
;W[bc];B[cb];W[cg];B[bq];W[dl]C[The fight in the lower right will decide the situation.];B[cm];W[gl];B[ij];W[hc]C[White is relatively weak at the bottom, the play of W52 is Cho's style.];B[jc];W[ec];B[bd]
;W[be];B[ac];W[qb]LB[hb:a]C[W58 is huge, but for White to descend at 'a' is better.];B[fd]LB[di:a]C[B59: Black aims to attach at 'a'.];W[mc]C[White counterattacks with W60.];B[nb]LB[mb:a][pb:b]C[B61 is the strongest answer, if W 'a', then B 'b',  Black's shape is good.];W[pe]
;B[od];W[kd];B[jd];W[kc]C[W66 is strong and unyielding, both players are famous with their power, both don't want to give way and make compromise.];B[ke];W[jb];B[je]C[B69 is a good move, White is hard to respond.];W[md];B[mf];W[pb];B[cj];W[di]C[The exchange of B73 with W74 is not necessarily to Black's advantage.]

;W[lr];B[pj];W[om];B[mk]C[After B103, Black's potential in the center has been dramatically increased.];W[oo];B[po]C[B105 is a good move, White is hard to answer.];W[ng]C["no good moves no play", W106 is a good choice.];B[nf]C[In the study room, Lee Changho 9p thinks White is better, but Black is relatively thick, so now it is still too early to make a conclusion.];W[og];B[nn];W[nj]
;B[pl];W[ol];B[ok];W[nk];B[pm];W[on];B[op]C[Through B117, after capturing one stone, Black's profit is big.];W[qi];B[qj];W[ri];B[fr];W[el];B[fm]
;W[dn];B[cp];W[dq];B[rj]C[B127 is a big endgame. Let's do a situation judgement: White has about 49 points, Black 54 points, because Black still has some potential in the center, minus komi, Black is leading about 5 to 6 points, in terms of professional players, it is already not easy for Black to lose the game.];W[gf];B[ee];W[gh];B[hi];W[eb]C[Through W132, White gains a little, but Black is still leading about 10 points on the board.];B[lh];W[fe];B[ed]
