Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[This is the decisive game 5 of the 31st Tengen Title between Yamashita 9p and Kono Rin 7p.];W[dc];B[dq];W[qq]C[As to the shape of the small points B1 and B3, W4 taking 3-3 is appropriate and fits Go theories.];B[ce]
;W[ed];B[kc]LB[oc:a][nc:b]C[With the extension of B7, Black's speed is fast, comparing with protecting the corner at 'a' or 'b', it is really hard to judge which one is better.];W[do]LB[cn:a]C[W8: White can consider to make the large knight's move at 'a' to break up the situation, the position of B7 will appear inappropriate.];B[dl];W[gp];B[eo];W[en];B[fo];W[cq]C[The attachment of W14 is a new play appeared recently.]
;B[dp]LB[fq:a][dr:b][dn:c][co:d][er:e]C[B15: For Black to jump at 'a' is common, next W 'b', B 'c', W 'e', and then B 'e' ......];W[cp];B[dn];W[co];B[cn]C[The direct play from B15 to B19 seems also playable.];W[bn];B[bm];W[dr]C[W20 and W22: White plays two consecutive hanes and is very thoughtful.]
;B[er]LB[fq:a]C[B23 answering the fight directly is not a clever choice. Since White already incurs loss with the hane of W20, with B23 Black can consider to jump at 'a'.];W[ep];B[eq];W[fp]LB[cr:a][cm:b][gn:c]C[If there is no exchange of W20 and B21, when White connects with W26, with B27 Black can capture one stone at 'a'. However in the real game, if Black captures at 'a', White can first play atari at 'b' then 'c', Black's shape will collapse.];B[go];W[ho];B[fm];W[cr]
;B[hp];W[fr];B[ip]C[Through B33, White's territory is a little better than Black's outside thickness.];W[df]C[W34 is an excellent point and can't be omitted.];B[np];W[qn]LB[pn:a]C[W36: White doesn't elect to make the big knight's move at 'a', it shows White is not fearful of Black's big moyo.];B[pm];W[pn];B[nm]C[Black expands his moyo with B37 and B39, this is Black's only choice.];W[nn]
;B[mn];W[om];B[ol];W[on]C[With W40 to W44, White takes chance to permeate.];B[nl]LB[mm:a]C[B45 is a slow move, Black should connect at 'a'.];W[mo];B[ln];W[mp]C[W46 and W48 are handy moves, White's profit is not small.];B[mq]C[With the hane of B49, Black tries to prevent White from forming territory at the bottom, and this is a little inconsistent with Black's original thought.];W[kp]
;B[lq];W[kq];B[lp];W[jo]C[With the sequence from W50 to W54, White easily has negated Black's tactics.];B[ko];W[hn];B[gm];W[jp];B[qm];W[jn]C[Through W60, White's play is excellent and White also captures two stones B31 and B33, White's situation is favorable.];B[pf];W[rm]
;B[rl];W[rn]LB[pl:a]C[W62 and W64 are steady, here White is already unnecessary to aim at the cut at 'a'.];B[qk];W[no];B[lo];W[oc];B[pc];W[ld];B[lc];W[md];B[mc];W[od]
;B[ne];W[nd];B[je];W[of];B[og];W[ng];B[pg];W[kf];B[jf];W[kg];B[ke];W[le];B[nh]
;W[mg]C[With the set pattern from W68 to W88, White ruins Black's territory and also obtains 6-7 point territory. So far, White's advantage becomes clear.];B[cg];W[pd];B[qb];W[pb];B[qc];W[hc]C[B89 and W94 are miai points.];B[ib];W[hb];B[ic];W[pe];B[qe]
;W[mh]C[White's playing tempo following W100 is steady and smooth, White runs safely to the end, this is just style of his teacher Kobayashi Koichi.];B[cc];W[cd];B[bd];W[dd];B[bc];W[cf];B[bf];W[dg];B[dh];W[eh];B[di];W[hd]
