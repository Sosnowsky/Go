;W[cd];B[cq];W[oc];B[dp];W[eq];B[cr];W[cj]C[White's opening doesn't conform to no conventional patterns, it is the old style.];B[cl]LB[iq:a]C[The extension of B13 is worth study, it always seems that you follow the foot step of your opponents, from the state of mind, Black wants to pincer at around 'a'.];W[jq];B[pe]LB[jc:a]C[I can't agree to the diagonal extension of B15, it is a little slow, it would be still better for Black to play the splitting move at 'a'.]
;W[kc];B[hq];W[hp];B[gp];W[ho];B[iq]LB[gq:a]C[B21: Black wants to connect at 'a' simply, but Black is worried that he may end in gote, but in the game, Black has to push and reduce has own liberties, so Black is also a little painful.];W[jp];B[ip];W[io];B[fq];W[kn];B[qm]

(;B[ff]LB[cc:a][dc:b][ce:c][bd:d][de:e][dd:f][dg:g]TR[cj]C[The play of B29 is inexplicable. Normally Black will attach at 'a', next W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 'e', W 'f' and B 'g', this way Black destroys side territory and the marked white stone also becomes weak, this is general thinking (see var a).];W[dl];B[cm];W[hg]LB[dg:a]C[W32 is unnecessary, White should defend at 'a'.]
;B[fh];W[dg];B[fj];W[qi];B[qg];W[oi];B[ne];W[qc];B[rc];W[rb]C[W40 and W42 are good moves! Black is a little difficult. In the game, White lives in sente then takes Black's lower right corner, White is successful undoubtedly.];B[pc];W[qb];B[od]
;W[rd];B[re];W[sc];B[nc];W[ro]LB[qq:a][qp:b][pq:c][oq:d][or:e][nr:f]C[W50 is again a good move! If White enters the corner as usual, then B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e' and B 'f', White would not gain any particular profit.];B[qo];W[qq]
;B[rn];W[or];B[pq];W[pr];B[rq];W[rr];B[rp];W[np]C[In the game, White is able to make the knight's move with W60, White's advantage is very obvious.];B[mi];W[rg];B[gc]C[After the cap of B61, White attaches with W62, but Black is worried that he may end in gote, so Black elects to take territory right away with B63, showing Lee Changho's contradiction. For Black to simply play B63 is better without the exchange of B61 and W62.];W[gd]

;B[ke];W[kg];B[ki];W[gg];B[fg];W[rl];B[oo];W[no];B[pk];W[qk];B[ql];W[rk];B[ae]LB[ie:a]C[The crossover of B115 is the last losing move! Black should jump to around 'a' to pound at White's thinness. In the game, White strikes first, but Black is not alive and the difference in points is also very big, Black already is powerless to retrieve his defeat.]
