];B[pq];W[cp]C[Both sides open with small points (3-4 point), it looks like leading us to Japanese ancient go world.]
;B[de];W[od];B[fd];W[pn];B[ep];W[qq];B[qi]LB[ql:a]C[With the opening to 11, either side plays on his own, it is very dazzling. The play of B11 is really strange, perhaps Black is looking for the perfect point of making two space extension at 'a' later on.];W[fc];B[cc]LB[gd:a]C[B13 has chosen the right joseki, if Black extends to 'a', the surrounding configuration is not satisfying. ];W[cb]LB[gd:a]C[White hanes to the corner but seems to be made use of, W14 certainly should be played at 'a to hane up.]
;B[gc];W[cd];B[ec];W[dd];B[ed]C[Black is very thick, achieving thickness in the opening should be satisfactory.];W[qc];B[ce];W[eb];B[fb];W[cn];B[be];W[bd];B[mc]
;W[pd];B[qe];W[pb];B[cl]C[Black presses hard everywhere, aiming to give a full play to his thickness.];W[qg];B[ql];W[pp];B[oq];W[op];B[mq];W[nq];B[nr];W[np]
;B[pf]C[B41 setting his lone stones into motion is a positive play.];W[pi];B[pj];W[ph];B[oj];W[of]C[It inevitably leads to a fierce fight.];B[rg]C[B47 attaching under on the second line is good and commonly used in this situation.];W[rf];B[og]C[B49 is a pre-planned fighting maneuver, White is hard to handle.];W[qf];B[cq]
;W[bq];B[dq];W[bo];B[pe];W[pg]C[After long meditation, White can only jump to the bait.];B[oe];W[ne];B[nf];W[rd];B[me];W[nd];B[md]C[Black is very happy with taking one white stone and sealing off White.]
;W[ni];B[li];W[mf];B[lf]C[The sacrificing sequence following B67 is a simple and clear approach.];W[mg];B[lg];W[nh]LB[mh:a]C[W70 is very painful, to obtain sente, if W70 switches to 'a', but afterwards White can not tolerate Black's wrapping tactic. ];B[el];W[ij]C[To win the game, W72 has to step into Black's moyo.];B[do]C[B73 is a good move to probe White, White is difficult.]
;W[br];B[bm]C[In the game, although White lives with sente, but it leaves a lot of aji, Black has many sente moves on the outside.];W[gj];B[hl];W[kj];B[mp];W[qm];B[kl]C[Black encloses the territory at the bottom at the maximum limit by taking advantage of the aji in the lower left corner.];W[kh];B[hi];W[hj];B[mh]
;W[ng];B[ki];W[ji];B[jh];W[lj];B[ih]C[Now White leaves no choice and must try to kill Black on the right at a large scale.];W[pl];B[jk];W[jj];B[mk];W[ll]C[The crosscut of B96 is the only move.];B[om]C[It is time for lunch break.]
;W[ol];B[nl]LB[lk:a][kk:b][lm:c][nk:d]C[B99 is the move that Luo Xihe regrets after the game, he thinks now Black needs only to play at 'a', followed by W 'b', and B 'c' capturing a white stone in the ladder, this way Black will take a big lead. The most severe damage White can manage is to capture Black on the right at 'd', then Black can cultivate his territory in the upper left with sente, this is much better that what happens in the game. ];W[lm];B[nn];W[pm];B[lk];W[kk];B[km];W[kn]
;B[jn];W[mj];B[nk];W[mo]C[The hane of W110 is very severe, the game has been turned around dramatically.];B[ln];W[mr];B[ko];W[lr];B[cr];W[bs];B[or]C[B117 is an overplay, actually this profit couldn't be obtained, White can fly into Black's territory.];W[qr]C[In the game Yuki Satoshi has summitted unexpectedly, perhaps due to no enough reading time in overtime.]
;B[kq];W[kr];B[jr]C[Black has gained some profit.];W[jq];B[jp];W[iq];B[ir];W[kg];B[kf];W[gh];B[gg];W[nb];B[mb]
