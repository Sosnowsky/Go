;W[qo];B[pl];W[ep];B[gq]C[B7 and B9: Wang Xi is very active in the opening.];W[pe]C[W10 kind of serves as ladder breaker.];B[qe];W[pf];B[qg];W[cq];B[bq]LB[dq:a]C[Otherwise with B15 Black can elect to play joseki at 'a'.];W[dq]
;B[cm];W[go];B[gp]C[The bump B19 is being studied a lot recently. Although it seems not a good move, White is not easy to handle.];W[br];B[fo]LB[bp:a]C[B21: If Black connects at 'a', White will retreat at 21. Black is heavy on both sides and not good.];W[bo];B[eo];W[bp]C[W20 to W24 is simple and clear. White gets a big corner, which is to Chang Hao's liking.];B[cf]LB[op:a]C[B25 is big move of course. However the bottom is also not small, therefore Black wants to make diagonal at 'a' and expand his moyo.]
;W[fd];B[di];W[mp];B[po];W[jp]C[W28 and W30: It seems White opens up the situation.];B[ho];W[jn];B[ko];W[jo];B[lq];W[lp];B[mq]C[B33 to B37 makes White thick, it is not to Black's advantage.]
;W[kp];B[qp];W[hm]LB[jl:a][im:b]C[W40 appears smooth, but it gives Black good point at 'a', White is not comfortable. W40 at 'b' is more steady.];B[gn];W[jd];B[jl]C[B43 is sharp! Black seeks thread to start a fight.];W[gm]LB[im:a][hn:b]C[W44: White knows Black will cut at 'a', but to connect with dame move at 'b' is also very painful.];B[im]C[After B45, the fierce fight until the end of game starts.]
;W[in];B[hn];W[em];B[ll]C[B49 is must-take vital point.];W[iq];B[dn];W[gj]LB[dk:a][dj:b]C[W52 is slow. White wants to play at 'a' or 'b', not allowing Black to connect easily.];B[dk]C[The shape of B53 is beautiful, Black is too comfortable.];W[ej];B[dj]
;W[nl];B[ii]C[B57 is good point.];W[gh];B[hk];W[gk];B[ig]C[B61: Black takes chance and enters into White's moyo. Black's tempo is very smooth.];W[ki]C[W62: White must attack this group. If Black settles here, White can't form territory at top.];B[hl];W[gl];B[kj];W[lj];B[li]C[In this crucial moment, crosscutting of B65 and B67 is very relentless!]
;W[lh];B[mi];W[kh];B[jj];W[dg];B[cg];W[pg]LB[mj:a]C[W72 and W74 are preparing to pull out at 'a'. However the result is not ideal.];B[qh];W[mj]LB[oo:a][pn:b]C[W76: If White first exchange W 'a' and B 'b', Black's severe tactic in the game wouldn't be effective.]
;B[gf];W[ff];B[nj]C[B79 is relentless!];W[ni];B[mh];W[oj];B[nk];W[mk];B[ok];W[ml];B[mg];W[kf];B[mm]C[Through W88, Black releases the killing move of B89! At this time, White's two groups unexpectedly can't connect together, the result is fatal!]
;W[oo]C[W90: White waits for Black to make mistake.];B[nn]C[B91 is vital point, Black didn't make any mistake.];W[om];B[on];W[pn];B[pm];W[pp];B[op];W[no];B[ol];W[oq]C[W100: Although it forms a ko, White couldn't find a ko threat on the board.];B[po]
;W[cl];B[pp]C[B103: Black's fighting result is brilliant.];W[dl];B[ir]C[B105: At bottom, only if Black doesn't die, Black will win the game.];W[hr];B[jr];W[hq];B[gr];W[kr];B[kq];W[jq];B[lr]
