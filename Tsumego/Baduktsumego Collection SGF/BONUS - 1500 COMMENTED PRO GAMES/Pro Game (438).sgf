;B[mc];W[qc];B[rc];W[pc];B[qg]LB[re:a]C[The two-space extension of B11 was once very popular, the old joseki is at 'a'.];W[rb]LB[me:a][kd:b][re:c]C[W12: If White is favorable in ladder, White can make knight at 'a', next W 'b' and 'c' are miai, White must get one.];B[rd];W[ne]
;B[qj];W[pg]LB[ld:a][kc:b]C[W16 is wrong order, White should first make knight at 'a'. If Black jumps to 'b', then White can make exchange of W16 and B17. However, in the real game, the exchange of W16 and B17 is not to White's advantage.];B[qh];W[ld];B[hd]LB[kc:a][ed:b]C[The purpose of B19 is clear, B 'a' and 'b' are miai, Black can be satisfied to play either.];W[gd]C[Just because of this reason,  I alertly elected to attach with W20. In post-game analysis, Ryu Shikun said this move was to his surprise and disrupted his plan.];B[ge];W[fe]
;B[he];W[jc];B[fd]LB[ff:a][de:b]C[B25: If Black plays hane at 'a', then White will attach at 'b', Black doesn't have good tactic either.

;W[cf];B[bf];W[bg];B[cg];W[df];B[bh];W[be];B[ag];W[bd]C[Through W42, the local variation comes to an end, White gains big profit on both sides. The attachment of W20 can be considered successful.];B[nq];W[qn];B[gq]LB[dk:a][cn:b][eh:c]C[The large knight of B45 is one of Ryu's regrettable moves. After White splits at 'a', Black is being pressed to the third line and not comfortable. Black should make small knight at 'b', later on B 'c' connecting all together, Black's situation is not bad.]
;W[dk];B[cm];W[eh];B[cj];W[dj];B[ck];W[dl];B[cl];W[pr];B[kp];W[dq]C[From W48 to W52, White takes advantage in sente, then attach the corner with W56, White is clearly favorable.

;B[eq];W[fp];B[dr];W[iq];B[gp];W[fr];B[gr]LB[go:a][jq:b]C[B65: Black feels his situation is not good, but in fact B65 is an overplay, to extend at 'a' is original move, next W65 and B 'b'.];W[go];B[hp]C[After W66, Black can only turn with B67, very painful.

];W[kq]
;B[lq];W[lp]C[The crosscut of W68 and W70 is severe.];B[ko];W[mq];B[lr];W[lo]LB[mr:a][mp:b][nr:c][jo:d]C[However, W74 is slow move. White should push at 'a', next B 'b', W74, B 'c' and W 'd', Black will be more difficult.
];B[jq];W[ho];B[ip]
;W[mr];B[kr];W[en];B[eo]C[I overlooked the strong move of B81.];W[ci];B[di];W[dh];B[bi];W[fo];B[em];W[do];B[dm]C[However, even like this, White's sequence from W82 to W88 is too hasty, White still should simply push at 89, B87 is not easy to escape. In the game, after Black connects with B89, White as a whole becomes thin.

;W[ep];B[co];W[fm];B[fl];W[gm];B[dn];W[gk];B[fi]LB[nr:a]C[B97 is local good move but its timing is early. Black should first clamp over at 'a', this move is huge, this way Black is already favorable for the game.

;W[fh];B[ek];W[je];B[gh];W[hh];B[gg];W[fk];B[el];W[hj];B[dg];W[np]C[Following W98, White elects to fight by sacrificing, obtain precious sente and get to hang with W112, the situation becomes close.
];B[rm];W[qk]LB[ql:a]C[The attachment of W114 is the winning move!]
;B[ql];W[pj];B[rj];W[hg]C[Since White is thick on the board, Black dares not resist. Due to the existence of W114, W116 and W118, the center already shows moyo sign.

];B[gl];W[hl];B[ii];W[hi];B[ik];W[hk];B[km]LB[im:a][kl:b]C[B125 is too slow! Since B 'a' is sente, at least Black should jump to 'b'.]
;W[jn];B[kn];W[kk]C[With the cap of W128, White encloses middle territory adequately, White's situation is favorable.

;B[pk];W[pf]LB[ok:a][pl:b]C[W140: White should first exchange W 'a' and B 'b'.];B[pi];W[oj];B[ok];W[nk]C[Luckily the wedge of W114 is clever move!
];B[nl];W[rn];B[nj];W[mi]C[With W144, White gets to play on both sides with W146 and W148, otherwise the outcome of this game is difficult to guess.]
;B[sb]C[There are little gains and losses in endgame, at the end Black is leading only 2 points on board, clearly it already has nothing to do with the outcome.

No comment afterwards.];W[qb];B[ib];W[ie];B[id];W[kc];B[fb];W[hf];B[gf];W[eb];B[ij];W[qf];B[rf]
