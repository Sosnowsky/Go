Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[pd]C[In this year's Xinren Wang, Yin Hang 2p advanced to the final, drawing so much attention. This is the second game in best-of-3 final, in the first game Gu Li took White and won by resignation.];W[dd];B[pp];W[cq];B[pj]C[In this game, Gu Li again opens with sanrensei fuseki. As to young Yin Hang, sanrensei opening is perhaps a little strange.];W[nq]
;B[lq];W[nc]C[The play of W6 and W8 is popular nowadays.];B[pf];W[qq];B[qp];W[pq];B[op];W[np]LB[nr:a][mo:b][kd:c]C[W14 is questionable, White should simply descend at 'a', when Black seals with the knight's move at 'b', White then can make the extension at 'c' at the top.];B[oq]
;W[or];B[pr];W[qr];B[nr];W[ps];B[mr]LB[no:a]C[B21: Black can also hane at 'a', but that way Black may end in gote, the big point at the top will be taken by White.];W[no];B[pm]LB[rq:a][rr:b]C[B23: Black normally will play hane at 'a', after exchanging with W 'b', then Black makes the extension of B23.];W[rp]C[The hane of W24 is the vital point, otherwise Black's descent at 24 becomes sente.]

(;W[lo]LB[qo:a][rq:b][po:c][sp:d][oo:e][rn:f][rr:g][qm:h][rs:i][pl:j][qn:k][pn:l]C[But White misses a chance with W26, White should cut at 'a', if Black ataris at 'b', then W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B24, W 'f', B 'g', W 'h', B 'i' and W 'j', White is a little favorable (see var a). Therefore when White cuts at 'a', Black probably will atari at 'c', next W 'k', B 'l' and W 'f', this way Black places hope on the center, but White's profit is big.];B[jp]
;W[jm]C[W28 is too loose.];B[rq];W[rr];B[fq]C[After the exchange of B29 and W30, Black gets to make a good extension at 31, Black's opening is successful.];W[sq];B[qn]LB[oc:a]C[B33: Because of advantage, Black doesn't seek a high efficient play, otherwise Black can take tenuki to bump at 'a'.];W[jo];B[ip];W[ep]C[W34 and W36 is very damaging.];B[eq]
;W[dq];B[go];W[gm]C[The cap of W40 is not a place to play, White seems to be at a loss what to do.];B[do];W[dp];B[ck];W[cm];B[dm];W[co];B[cf];W[fc];B[bd];W[cc]
;B[dh]C[With the sequence from B41 to B51, we can see Gu Li is more and more patient, a mature player needs to guarantee victory.];W[qc]LB[kd:a][qh:b]C[W52: White grabs territory desperately, but for White to make an extension at 'a' is better, eyeing for the invasion at 'b', this way there will be more variations.];B[pc];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[oc];W[re];B[rf];W[qe]
;B[qf];W[pe];B[oe];W[of];B[qd]C[Black first pushes with B65, it is good order.];W[rd];B[ne];W[se];B[mf];W[kc];B[ml]C[B71 is a good point.];W[kf]
;B[lh]C[The exchange of W72 and B73 is no good.];W[rm]C[W74 tests the opponent's tolerance.];B[lm]LB[so:a]C[B75 seems unnecessary, to descend at 'a' is just fine.];W[pl]C[White tenaciously seeks a chance with the sequence following W76.];B[ol];W[pk];B[ok];W[qm];B[on];W[qj]
;B[pi];W[ri];B[qk];W[ql];B[rk]C[After B85 and B87, it forms a ko.];W[sk];B[sl];W[rj];B[sj];W[rn];B[so];W[si];B[sn]
;W[sk];B[rc];W[sc];B[sj];W[og];B[pg];W[sk];B[rb];W[ra];B[sj];W[ph]C[But W106 is a "blind ko", White suffers a big defeat.];B[sk]C[
