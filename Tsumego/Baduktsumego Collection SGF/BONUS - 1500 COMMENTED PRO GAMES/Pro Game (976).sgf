;W[hc];B[oc];W[qj];B[cf]C[The opening of both sides is very common.];W[fd];B[cc];W[cd];B[dc];W[ed];B[ec]LB[fb:a]C[B15: Black's descent at 'a' is often seen.];W[bc]LB[bd:a]C[The hane of W16 is unexpected, White generally will simply descend at 'a'.]
;B[bb];W[bd];B[gc];W[gd];B[hd]LB[hb:a]C[The cut of B21 is working because of the hane of W16, otherwise White can jump to 17 and kill Black, this way Black can only play hane at 'a'.];W[ic];B[cj]LB[he:a]C[B23: For Black to directly extend at 'a' and fight is better, the exchange in the game is not necessarily to Black's advantage.];W[ab];B[ba];W[ch]
;B[cn];W[fq];B[he];W[gb];B[fb];W[lc];B[eh];W[di];B[cg];W[bh];B[bg]LB[ef:a][ag:b][dk:c]C[B37 is an overplay! After White strikes the vital points at 'a', Black itself is thin. For Black to jump at 'a' is the original move, next W 'b' and B 'c', this way Black is vivid.]
;W[ef];B[eg];W[gf];B[gh];W[ci]LB[hf:a][ek:b]C[W42 is a good move that is not easily found. If White simply presses at 'a', next B 'b', then White can no longer exchange W42 and B43. In the game, due to addition of W42, White already is out of danger of being killed. This way we can also see B37's failure.];B[dh]LB[ff:a]C[B43: From the mindset, Black doesn't want to proceed as in the game, Black wants to wedge at 'c'.];W[hf];B[fj];W[dj]

;W[gn];B[gq];W[bp];B[fp];W[co];B[bo];W[in];B[cp];W[er];B[fr];W[eq];B[ih]LB[je:a][il:b]C[The jump of B71 is not the right place to play, because Black still dare not jump to 'a', so for Black to jump at 'b' is better.]
;W[il];B[hr];W[kh]TR[he][hd]C[The cap of W74 is a good point, Black is being attacked, also White takes the chance to capture the two marked black stones cleanly, now White is clearly favorable.];B[jk];W[ik];B[ji];W[ki];B[jj];W[lk];B[jg];W[je]
;B[ke];W[kg];B[jf];W[jd];B[kf];W[hi];B[hh];W[hp];B[gp];W[iq];B[jl];W[ir];B[dm]
;W[co];B[bj];W[gk]C[W98: White makes himself thick, both sides dare not easily take action in the corner ko.];B[cp];W[fi];B[bq];W[gi];B[ei];W[ej];B[fh];W[ap];B[jn];W[im]
;B[co];W[br];B[qh];W[qn];B[oj];W[on];B[ol];W[nk];B[ok];W[mm];B[np]C[The sequence from B111 to B119 are the last losing moves. Now Black's situation is not good, at any rate Black should make something as to White's four stones in the center, with B111 for Black to simply cap at 113 is not a bad idea, Black can only use some unusual tactics in order to have a chance to win.];W[ql];B[nn]C[Now Black crosscuts with B121, it is already one-step slow, White can handle separately, and instead Black itself is very dangerous.]
