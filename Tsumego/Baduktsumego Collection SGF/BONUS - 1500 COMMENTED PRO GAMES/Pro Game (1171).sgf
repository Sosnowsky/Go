;W[ed];B[ci];W[oc];B[jc];W[hc];B[mc]C[The opening from B1 to B11 is Choi Cheolhan's favorite, however I personally think, White has nothing to complain.];W[fq];B[dn];W[dr];B[gq];W[gr]LB[co:a]C[As to the attachment of B15, White's joseki selection following W16 is very appropriate. First, Black has no severe tactic to place ladder breaker, second, Black's corner is still left with making life in the corner by striking at 'a'.]

;W[jo];B[pe]LB[pc:a]C[The diagonal of B31 is somewhat territory-damaging, Black may want to make diagonal at 'a'. In the real game, White easily makes life with 5 points and can be satisfied.];W[qb];B[nb];W[ob];B[ne];W[rc];B[rd];W[of];B[oe];W[nc];B[mb]
;W[md];B[ld];W[oa]LB[me:a][nd:b][mf:c]C[W44: If White first pushes at 'a', Black will cut at 'b', White strengthens to make life with W44, Black can capture White's two stones in a ladder at 'c', this way although White can obtain sente, it is also very damaging.];B[pm];W[me];B[nf];W[le];B[lg]LB[kd:a]C[The knight's move of B49 is very strong and unyielding, Choi's cruelty appears vividly on the board. Normally Black will retreat at 'a', White will jump to 49, Black's situation is very difficult.]
;W[cg];B[ee];W[fe];B[ef];W[kd];B[hb];W[gb];B[hd];W[gc];B[jd]C[Black's sequence from B51 to B59 is very positive.];W[ff]C[Since White's situation is not bad, with W60 White doesn't elect to fight directly.];B[dh]

;B[ld];W[co];B[do];W[lc];B[ib]C[After Black retreats with B79, Black is ko-alive locally, but since White has no proper ko threats at this time, to make life the corner first is a clever choice.];W[cq];B[cp];W[bp];B[bo];W[br];B[ap]C[B85: Black initiates the ko and clearly plans to reduce one ko threat from each side.];W[aq]
;B[bq];W[na];B[ld];W[bp];B[ke];W[ao];B[ro];W[bn];B[dl];W[rp]C[Through W96, White is a little favorable for the game.];B[lo];W[kf];B[kj]
;W[kd];B[ja];W[kl];B[kn];W[kk];B[lj];W[jn];B[ml];W[ck];B[dk];W[dm]LB[cm:a][cj:b][dj:c][bi:d][cl:e][bl:f][bh:g][bj:h][ch:i][mp:j]C[W110 is clearly miscalculation and also the losing move of this game! White should peep at 'a', next B110, W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 'e', W 'f', B 'g', W 'h', B 'i' and W 'j', this way it will be a close game with White having slight edge.]
;B[cm];W[em];B[fm];W[cn];B[el];W[en];B[hp]C[White perhaps overlooks Black's good moves of B113 and B117 to escape simply.];W[fn];B[ip];W[jq];B[fo];W[gm];B[go]
;W[jp];B[hn];W[cl];B[hm];W[fl];B[lq]C[Through B129, the situation has already been completely turned around.];W[bi];B[bh];W[cj];B[bj];W[di];B[ch];W[jj]
;B[ep];W[op];B[mp];W[no];B[mn]C[Choi Cheolhan won the champion by defeating Lee Changho 3:2.])
