;W[hd];B[ic];W[hc];B[hb];W[gb]C[In the real game, after White pushes and cuts with W20 and W22, locally Black doesn't have any good follow-up tactic.];B[qj];W[ib]C[The atari of W24 is very big.];B[qq]LB[on:a][np:b][rp:c][pk:d]C[Although B25 entering the corner is very common, but due to the addition of B23, Black wants to jump out at 'a', next W 'b', B 'c', W25 and B 'd', Black can capture one stone W8, this way Black is relatively more vivid.]
;W[qp];B[pq];W[op];B[rp];W[ro];B[rq];W[qo];B[nq];W[lq]C[The forcing move of W34 is very big, also indirectly strengthening White on the right side.];B[np];W[no];B[lp];W[kp]
;B[mo];W[nn];B[mn];W[mm];B[ko];W[jp];B[pn];W[rm]LB[rn:a][pl:b][qm:c][pm:d][pk:e]C[W46: White should turn at 'a', if Black still attaches at 'b', White can bump at 'c', Black can't connect at 'd', otherwise White can hane out at 'e', Black has no good answer.]
;B[pl];W[pk];B[rn];W[ol]LB[qk:a]C[W50: If White crosses over on the first line, Black's cut at 'a' will be effective.

;W[ha];B[od]LB[nd:a]C[The cut of B73 is questionable. Black should hane and cut at 'a', because Black is favorable in the ladder.];W[nd];B[ne];W[ng];B[me];W[lc];B[ld];W[ob];B[kc];W[sd];B[sc]

;B[kd];W[qb];B[rb];W[id];B[bp]LB[jh:a]C[B101 is the last big point, if Black strengthens at around 'a', White will gets to act first on the left side, Black's situation is not optimistic.];W[cq];B[ck];W[lg]LB[lf:a]C[W104: For White to strike at 'a' is better. In the real game, it forms a ko fight, it appears a worry-free ko for White, but because White doesn't have any proper ko threats, through B133, Black eliminates the ko, Black is still very thick.];B[lf];W[mh]

;B[lh];W[cf];B[cg];W[ch]LB[de:a][bg:b][ef:c]C[W136: White should atari at 'a', next B 'b' and W 'c', this is clearly better than the real game.];B[bg];W[dh];B[ef];W[bh];B[ce];W[dj]
;B[do]LB[co:a][bs:b][en:c]C[B143 is a bad move, after White squeezes at 'a', Black still needs to hang at 'b', Black clearly incurs loss. Black should jump to 'c'.];W[cp];B[ei];W[di];B[bq];W[co];B[bo];W[dn];B[eo];W[cm]
;B[bn];W[en];B[ep];W[dr];B[cr];W[dq];B[bs];W[jo]LB[ln:a][lo:b][kn:c][im:d]C[The turn of W160 is too loose! White should hane at 'a', after B 'b', then W160, Black has to turn out at 'c', White can make the knight's move at 'd', completely capturing three black stones, White is favorable.];B[gp]C[B161 is a game-deciding move. Here Shao Weigang perhaps overlooks the opponent's tenaciousness.]
;W[gq];B[fn];W[gl];B[ho];W[fp];B[hl];W[ln]LB[fo:a]C[W168 is the losing move! It completely breaks away from the main battle field. White should capture at 'a', the game would be still to White's advantage.];B[fo];W[hp];B[fl];W[gk];B[fk]
