;W[od];B[oc];W[pd]C[Following W8, it leads to big avalanche joseki.];B[pc];W[qe];B[nc];W[nd];B[md];W[qc];B[rd];W[qb];B[pe]C[The cut of B17 is popular new variation recently.]

;B[ob];W[lf];B[mf];W[mg]C[The sequence through W34 is generally regarded inevitable for both sides.];B[lg]C[The cut of B35 is must!];W[oa]C[W36 first makes sure that playing atari on three stones, B13, B29 and B33, is ko threat later on.];B[qa];W[nf];B[ma];W[mh];B[kg];W[fd]C[W42: White handles lightly.]
;B[ed];W[fe];B[ki]C[The jump of B45 is vital point for the big situation.];W[fc]LB[ie:a];B[id]LB[kb:a]C[The play of B47 is inevitable, if it is omitted, next White can clamp at 'a', Black can't tolerate.];W[ee]C[The turn of W48 is calm.];B[cf];W[eh]LB[cb:a]C[After the jump of W50, White is left with the strike at 'a' and the tactic of pulling out three stones.]
;B[if];W[cb];B[cc]LB[eb:a][de:b]C[B53: Black can only play this, if Black counterattacks at 'a', after White extends to 'b', B49 will be separated.];W[eb];B[hc]LB[gb:a]C[The diagonal of B55 is calm. Black may want to peep at 'a' but is worried about White's counterattack at 55.];W[ch];B[bb];W[ba]C[W56 and W58: White initiates the ko fight.];B[gb]C[The timing of B59 is excellent.]
;W[fb];B[db];W[qn]C[W62: After long mediation, White dares not start the complicated ko fight. In terms of momentum, Black already takes the upper hand.];B[ca];W[he];B[ie];W[gi]C[W64 and W66: White needs to reinforce.];B[qh]C[B67 is strong.];W[mj]C[W68 is damaging to territory.];B[oh];W[og]
;B[qk]C[After the two-space extension of B71, Black is successful.];W[cn]LB[fq:a]C[W72: White has no assurance of success if playing at 'a'.];B[jq];W[hq];B[mq];W[oq];B[jo];W[ho]LB[eq:a]C[W78 at 'a' is original move, this way the situation is close.];B[gk]
;W[ek];B[cq];W[dq];B[cp];W[co];B[dr];W[er];B[br]C[Black makes ko from B81 to B87. Since White is heavy and Black is light, White dares not start the ko.];W[jj];B[in];W[kp];B[jp];W[gm]
;B[mo];W[il];B[es];W[fs];B[ds]C[B95 and B97 make White painful.];W[bp]LB[fr:a]C[The original move is to connect at 'a', but White is reluctant to allow Black to strengthen at 98.];B[fr]C[But White's loss is even bigger, Black is favorable.];W[bq];B[cr];W[eq];B[fq]
;W[eo];B[aq];W[rg];B[rh];W[rl];B[ql]C[W108 and B109 are miai.];W[rk];B[rj];W[hr];B[bo];W[bn];B[ap];W[qm]
;B[hn];W[go];B[nr];W[qg];B[nk]C[B121 is not necessary, Black can win the game by making life steadily.];W[mn];B[no];W[nn];B[mk]LB[ni:a]C[B125 is also questionable, if peeping at 'a', Black can make life easily.];W[pj]C[The sequence following W126 is game-deciding.];B[qj]
;W[nj];B[oj]C[B129 is good move!];W[pi];B[oi];W[ph];B[pk];W[ol];B[ok]LB[om:a]C[But Black misses good chance with B135, if clamping at 'a', Black can make life easily.];W[jg];B[kf];W[lj]
;B[ln];W[lm];B[on]LB[om:a]C[The most inexplicable is, with B139 and B141, Black can always win the game by playing at 'a' instead.];W[kn];B[lo];W[om];B[po];W[pn];B[oo];W[mm];B[qo];W[jm]
;B[rn];W[rm];B[ro]C[From B145 to B153, it forms an unbalanced exchange.];W[ko];B[ir]C[But since Black's advantage is huge early on, now the situation is still slightly to Black's advantage.];W[gs]C[Being pressured by time, Black incurs loss in endgame again and again, finally the game gets overturned pitifully.];B[bh];W[bi];B[gn];W[fn];B[kl];W[lk]
