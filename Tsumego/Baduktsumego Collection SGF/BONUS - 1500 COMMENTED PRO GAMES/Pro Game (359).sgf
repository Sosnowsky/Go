;B[cf];W[fc];B[bd];W[nc];B[qf];W[cc];B[ci];W[pb];B[qc];W[nq]LB[mq:a]C[W16: Lee Sedol's play is very positive, normally White will make the two-space extension at 'a'.];B[lc];W[od]
;B[of];W[pc];B[qd];W[me];B[hc];W[ke];B[jd];W[je];B[id];W[lb];B[kb];W[mb];B[hf]
;W[ff]LB[df:a][cg:b][oo:c]C[The big jump of W32 is a little questionable, White should attach at 'a', next B 'b' and W 'c'.];B[gb]C[In the game, White incurs some loss in the exchange of W32 and B33.];W[df];B[cg];W[oo];B[pn];W[on];B[pm];W[om]
;B[pl];W[nk]C[From the play of W42, Lee Sedol momentum is very strong.];B[ip];W[jp];B[io];W[hr];B[gq];W[go]LB[hq:a][fo:b][dn:c]C[W48 is Lee Sedol's style, but here White is clearly unreasonable, White normally will push at 'a', followed by B 'b' and W 'c'.];B[fo]C[B49 is a severe counterattack, it is a very brilliant play, Black turns the situation to his favor.]
;W[fn];B[eo];W[gp];B[eq];W[hq];B[do];W[fk]C[Through W56, an exchange has resulted, Black has relatively more territory and is easier to play.];B[hj];W[ie];B[he];W[gd];B[hd];W[bo]
;B[cp];W[bp];B[cq];W[cl];B[gl];W[em];B[il];W[bq];B[br];W[hh]C[W72 is strong and unyielding.];B[fb]C[Black at the top is still not completely alive, but because the surrounding White is thin, Black is not dangerous temporally.];W[eb]
;B[lf]C[B75: Black wants to take advantage in sente, but in fact it is unnecessary.];W[ji]C[The counterattack of W76 is a top-notch good move of Lee Sedol.

After this move, it is time for noon break.];B[le];W[kd];B[kc];W[ld];B[md];W[mc];B[mf];W[nd];B[ig];W[ih]C[Through W86, Black's several stones in the center is hard to breathe.]
;B[kf];W[qb];B[rb]C[Through B89, the situation is still easier for Black to control.];W[ra];B[gi];W[pg]C[W92 is very strong and unyielding, showing Lee Sedol's style.];B[pf]C[Black connects with B93, White takes advantage.];W[bi]C[W94 is a not-easy-to-find move, Black seems to have been kicked on the butt.];B[cj];W[bj];B[ej]LB[ei:a]C[B97 is questionable, if Black jumps to 'a', Black should be still fine in the game.]
;W[hk]C[The attachment and cut of W98 is severe, Lee Sedol "the invincible youth" is indeed perfectly justifiable, it is not easy to notice this move.];B[gk];W[ik];B[ij];W[jk];B[ck];W[bk];B[jj];W[kj];B[dl];W[dm];B[el];W[fl]
;B[gm];W[ek];B[dk];W[ch];B[dh];W[bh];B[fm];W[di];B[fj];W[dg]C[In the exchange up to W120, Black incurs loss.];B[cm];W[bl];B[or]

;B[cn];W[bn];B[mr];W[nr];B[ns];W[mq]C[Lee Sedol's play following W142 is very brilliant, Black is a little difficult to win this game, Black's territory is inadequate.];B[ok];W[oj];B[nj]C[The diagonal and cut of B143 and B145 are game-deciding moves.];W[ni]C[The counter-hane of W146 is strong.];B[nl];W[mj]
;B[mk];W[qh]C[Through W150, White already has a living shape.];B[ri]C[B151 is a uncommon play.];W[rj];B[rk];W[qi];B[sj];W[qk];B[rl];W[rh]C[After White settles down with W158, White is leading in territory.];B[qj];W[oh]C[Through W160, White simply makes life, Black's situation is still not good.]
;B[kn];W[mm];B[mh];W[rj];B[lr];W[jo];B[qj];W[ml];B[nj];W[rj]LB[jn:a]TR[io][ip]C[The value of Black's connection at 'a' already becomes smaller, because after the connection, Black has the tactic of capturing the two marked stones in sente. Though W170, if the game proceeds to normal endgame, it will be a close game, but Black is a little unfavorable.]
;B[db];W[nk]C[W172 is an attitude of taking advantage, generally, this kind of play will complicate the situation, but Lee Sedol is obviously very confident --- I can also win this way.];B[cb];W[li];B[sb];W[la];B[bc];W[im];B[ce];W[eh];B[jr];W[gn];B[kq]
;W[kp];B[iq];W[ir];B[in];W[hm];B[jn];W[lp];B[gr];W[hp];B[hn];W[kr];B[ks];W[lq]
;B[is]C[B197 is unreasonable.];W[kr]C[W198 shows Lee Sedol's calculation strength.];B[hs];W[js];B[ob];W[hg]C[White squeezes with W202, clearly Lee Sedol already precisely has calculated the variations over here.];B[jr];W[fs]C[W204 is a good tesuji, in this kind of play, Lee Sedol is very experienced.];B[fr];W[js];B[jg]
;W[gs];B[na];W[en]C[When W120, Black's one group at the top or bottom will die for sure, overall Black doesn't gain anything.];B[es];W[fk];B[fh];W[ei];B[gf];W[gg];B[kh];W[ki];B[co];W[ar]

;B[pa];W[ja];B[ic];W[oa]C[In the end, Black is already hard to give Komi and has to concede defeat.

Lee Sedol wins the champion by 2:0.])
