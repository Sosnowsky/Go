;B[ic]C[The sequence from B1 to B19 is common.];W[qf]C[The invasion of W20 is also normal.];B[qe]LB[pf:a]C[B21: As to this, for Black to press at 'a' is relatively often seen.];W[pf]C[In the game, since Black can't take care of both, protecting the corner and preventing the invasion, Black is not good.];B[nd];W[ph];B[rf];W[rg];B[re];W[kc]
;B[rh]LB[nb:a][pb:b][ke:c]C[Next with W30 White should directly make knight at 'a', if Black answers at 'b', then White can jump out at 'c'.];W[qg];B[sg];W[qi]C[As to the clamp of B29, W30 and W32 are heavy.];B[je];W[nb];B[pb];W[me];B[of]LB[pi:a]C[Since White's liberty is tight, after Black attaches out with B37, White has the defect of cutting point at 'a'.]
;W[md];B[ee];W[df];B[hq]LB[pi:a]C[B41: Black aims to cut at 'a'.];W[ri];B[sh]LB[go:a]C[But B43 connecting two stones is overly tenacious, now to seal White off at 'a' is good situational judgement.];W[sf];B[se];W[cl]C[White invades with W46 strongly, Black is relatively difficult.]
;B[dl];W[bl];B[bn];W[id]C[The crosscut of W50 is unnecessary, helping Black to reinforce himself.];B[hd];W[dk];B[dp]LB[cr:a]C[As to the squeezing move of B53, with W54 White should hang at 'a', it is damaging to endgame, but it can guard against Black's play in the real game.];W[bq];B[ck]C[Black has no other choices but to play the sequence following B55.];W[dj];B[ci]
;W[di];B[eq];W[er];B[ch];W[dh];B[bg];W[bf];B[bh]LB[ce:a]C[Luckily after Black plays hane-and-connect of B63 and B65, Black is left with the peep at 'a', this way Black's loss of being captured has been greatly reduced.];W[dm];B[el];W[em];B[fl]

;B[fr];W[cd];B[es]C[Through B85, it leads to a big exchange, but White is clearly favorable for the whole game.];W[hn];B[jc];W[kd];B[jd];W[hl]C[W86 and W90 are of favorable consciousness.];B[im];W[hm];B[io];W[in]C[The push of W94 is clearly not good.]
;B[ko];W[mo];B[pi]C[B97 is game-deciding move.];W[oh];B[pl];W[pm];B[nn]C[B99 and B101 are playing tempo, the situation becomes complicated.];W[op];B[np];W[no];B[mp];W[pp]LB[oo:a]C[W106 is crude, White certainly should simply connect at 'a'.]
;B[pq];W[qq];B[qo];W[on];B[qr];W[lo];B[lp];W[kn];B[jn];W[jm];B[jo];W[km];B[nh]
;W[ng]C[The counterattack of W120 is strong.];B[og];W[mh];B[ni];W[oi];B[nf]C[However, Black pushes with B125, White is also dangerous.];W[mg];B[mf];W[lf];B[lg];W[kf]C[Luckily, White is very thick in the center and still can hold up.];B[pj]
;W[mi];B[nj];W[oj];B[mj];W[lh];B[pk];W[ok];B[ol];W[nk];B[nl];W[mk];B[rk];W[hg]C[B143: Black captures three stones and White gets to enclose the center, White is still favorable.]
;B[lj]LB[mm:a]C[B145: Black aims to cut at 'a'.];W[lk]C[W146 is a must.];B[kg]C[Following B147, Black borrows strength.];W[kh];B[jg];W[jf];B[jh];W[kj];B[if];W[ig];B[hf]
;W[gg]C[W156: White responds strongly, Black is still not good.];B[ke];W[le];B[mc];W[kb];B[mb];W[ji];B[ne];W[ih];B[pg];W[fd];B[ed];W[ec]
;B[fe];W[fb];B[gd];W[gq];B[gr];W[hp];B[iq];W[gb];B[gf];W[am];B[an];W[ef]LB[mm:a]C[W180 is weird, White certainly should reinforce at 'a'.]
;B[bm];W[rq];B[rr];W[al];B[ll];W[ml]LB[ln:a]C[W186 is the losing cause, if White connects at 'a', White wins the game for sure.];B[mm];W[kk];B[rl];W[rm]LB[qn:a]C[White's last losing move is W190, if White plays at 'a' instead, White still wins.]
;B[ln]C[After the cut of B191, Black finally turns the game around.];W[ro];B[mn];W[rp];B[oo];W[qn];B[po];W[sn];B[ho];W[gn];B[sl];W[sm];B[jb]
