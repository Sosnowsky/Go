;B[db];W[eb];B[cb];W[ec];B[cf];W[qf];B[cn];W[fq];B[bp];W[cq];B[dl]C[With the sequence from B1 to B29, Black elects a complete territory-oriented strategy, it seems Heyang prepares to first aggressively take territory.];W[eg]LB[df:a]C[W30 can't be omitted, here if Black attaches at 'a', White can't tolerate.]
;B[of]LB[jc:a][qh:b]C[B31 is also a good point, if White dares not push and attack Black, then the forcing move at 'a' and invasion at 'b' will become miai, Black must get to play one, this way White is not easy to handle.];W[pe]C[W32: White already has no way to retreat.];B[nd];W[oe];B[ne];W[nf];B[og];W[mf]C[Through W38, a fierce fight already can't be avoided.];B[rg]LB[ph:a][qh:b][qi:c][qg:d][pc:e][pd:f][jc:g]C[B39 is the strongest move at this juncture, if Black makes the diagonal at 'a', then White can cross over by attaching at 'b', next B 'c' and W d'', Black has no follow-up, in the upper right corner the cross-cut at 'e' is left and very severe, Black couldn't resist, with B39 if Black attaches back at 'f', then White makes one-space extension at 'b', B39, W 'd' and B 'g', this variation is also possible but Black appears a little weak, in terms of momentum, Black is reluctant to play this way.]
;W[qe]LB[qg:a][pc:b][pb:c][qc:d][qb:e][rd:f][rb:g][rf:h]C[W40 is also the strongest resistance, here we showed a lot of variations in the study room, thinking Black is a little dangerous, for example, B 'a', W 'c', B 'c', W 'd', B 'e', W 'f', B 'g' and W 'h', this way Black couldn't capture White, on the outside Black already doesn't have any special tactic to borrow strength.
];B[rd]LB[qg:a]C[B41: Black elects to excise patience, confronting with White directly by blocking at 'a' is indeed not to Black's advantage.];W[ph]C[After White flies out with W42, in this local fight, Black clearly incurs loss, it seems W12 and W14 are prepared moves.];B[nh]
;W[qg];B[mc];W[lg];B[hq]LB[ok:a][mi:b][qk:c][rk:d][pj:e][ql:f][pl:g]C[B47: Black perhaps should play at around 'a', if White makes the knight's move at 'b', then B 'c', W 'd', B 'e', W 'f' and B 'g', this way the variation is relatively complicated.];W[mo];B[bq];W[lj]C[In the game, after White caps with W50, Black's situation is not optimistic.]
;B[ll];W[ml];B[mm];W[mk]LB[jl:a]C[When B51, W52 and W54 are of favorable consciousness, for White to cap at 'a' is also playable, White's consideration in the game is, to capture three stones on the right side is still very efficient.

After this move, it is time for lunch break.];B[dr]LB[kn:a]C[B55: Black can also first make the knight's move at 'a', aiming at White on the left side, it is not bad, in the real game, Black's profit is not big in the direct attack.];W[hp];B[ip];W[gq];B[ho];W[gp]
;B[hr];W[cr];B[gr];W[fr];B[br];W[fn];B[in];W[fl]C[Through W68, Black doesn't gain much by attacking.];B[no]LB[rn:a][rm:b][nn:c][oo:d][mn:e][on:f][nm:g][lp:h]C[B69: Black should first hane at 'a', followed by W 'b', B69, W 'c' and B 'd', if White connects at 'a', when Black pushes at 'f', White can only turn at 'g', next B 'h', this is Black's most ideal result.]
;W[nn];B[lp];W[pp];B[oq];W[qq];B[rq];W[rn];B[sp]C[The variation up to B77 is clearly no better than the one we described earlier.];W[mp];B[mq];W[lo];B[kp];W[kc]C[W82 is a big move, Black's situation is not good.]
;B[sf]LB[nm:a]C[B83 looks small, to push at 'a' or reduce at the top is bigger.];W[dk];B[ck];W[cj];B[ek];W[dj];B[el]C[When White attaches down with W84 and W86, B87 and B89 are inevitable counterattack.];W[cl]C[After White takes one stone with W90, Black suffers a big loss in territory, now Black has to try to kill this white group, at least attacking strongly and taking as much profit as possible, the outcome of this game is subject to this fight.];B[dq]C[B91 is severe.];W[cp]
;B[cs];W[ep];B[en]C[Through B95, this white group appears very thin, it seems Black may have a chance. Looking back W86 may be a little unreasonable, Black perhaps can only retreat at 88.];W[go];B[bk];W[bl];B[bm];W[bj];B[nm];W[hn];B[io];W[hl]C[When Black pushes with B101, White has no other choice but to make life with W102 and W104.]
;B[km]C[Through B105, Black's situation is clearly much better than earlier, the game becomes very close, Black may have some tactic on the right side, however it is somewhat not so clear, the play in the game is steady.];W[iq];B[ir];W[ol]C[The reinforce of W108  is necessary, the aji on the right side is too bad.];B[om];W[pl];B[le]C[At this time, it is hard to judge whether the sequence following B111 is good or bad.];W[me];B[ld];W[pc];B[pd];W[od]
;B[ob];W[md];B[lc];W[nc];B[nb];W[jd];B[rh];W[ri];B[je];W[ie];B[np]LB[cm:a]C[Through B127, the situation already becomes very close, it may lead to a half-point game. What is worth mentioning is, to atari at 'a' is the vital point that both sides want to play, here perhaps both sides didn't notice it, but it is indeed a very important point, it is related to both points and eye shape, who can take this point will have a big impact on the outcome of this game.];W[bg]
;B[bf];W[jf];B[bh]C[B131 seems small, Black should play in the center.];W[cg];B[ch];W[dg];B[ag];W[ai];B[ah];W[am];B[an];W[dn];B[cm]
;W[ak];B[em];W[fj]C[Through W144, it is still a close game but slightly to White's advantage. Among these moves, with W138, White should squeeze at 141.];B[jj];W[fk];B[kj];W[lk];B[kk];W[jl];B[kl];W[ii]C[After White seals off with W152, Black's defeat is already decided.];B[pm]
