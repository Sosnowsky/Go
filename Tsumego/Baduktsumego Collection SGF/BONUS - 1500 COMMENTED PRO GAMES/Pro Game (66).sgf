;W[dc];B[de];W[dh];B[cj]C[Black counter pincers and is seldom seen, Hua Yigang 8p jokingly calls it "Zude Style", because this move was often adopted in the fast games between Chen Zude 9p and Hua Yigang. Today Chang Hao suddenly chooses this play, not sure whether he ever consulted with Mr. Chen.];W[fd]C[Lee Changho answers with a steady knight's move, eptomizing his style.];B[cn];W[fq];B[cc];W[cb];B[cd]C[The attachment and pull-back of B11 and B13 are natual moves, enticed by big points, Lee Changho is pondering.];W[cg];B[ec]LB[fe:a][ge:b][ed:c][fc:d][ff:e]C[B15 is a violent play, however, after deep study,  Zhou Heyang 9p thinks this move is more or less unreasonable. The common play is at 'a', followed by W 'b', B 'c', W 'd' and B 'e'. (In the postgame analysis, top pros agree Chang Hao was overzealous, and B15 is the losing move.)]
;W[eb];B[fc];W[ed];B[dd];W[db]C[After both sides make careful consideration, a fierce fight results.];B[gc];W[gd];B[hc];W[bc];B[bd];W[bb];B[ff];W[hd]
;B[id];W[hf]LB[ic:a][ee:b]C[W30 has two purposes, it looks common but in fact it is full of murderous intentions. Black has two cut points 'a' and 'b', and can not take care of both simultaneously.];B[jd]
(;W[fh]LB[ee:a][df:b][ef:c][dg:d][eg:e][ch:f][bf:g][ci:h][eh:i][ae:j]C[Black is in a bitter battle. If White directly pushs at 'a', followed by B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f', W 'g', B 'h' and W 'i', then the diagonal of B 'j' is brilliant, White is about killed. (see var a)];B[gg];W[hg];B[gh]C[It's time for lunch break.]
;W[hh];B[gi];W[ee];B[ef];W[df];B[ej]C[Black cannot help but to sacrifice 5 key stones, Lee Changho has achieved magnificent profit in the first fight of the opening.];W[qf]LB[lc:a][mc:b][jb:c]C[W42 approaching from this side is a play that Lee Changho uses to control the situation under favorable situations. From the current position, White usually invades near 'a' or 'b', because 'c' is the vital point for the shape. But Lee Changho perhaps wants to avoid complications when having an advantage.];B[nc];W[rd]
;B[qg];W[rg];B[rf];W[qh]C[White is favorable in the ladder.];B[pg];W[re];B[gp]C[But B51 as a ladder breaker is a good move.];W[gq];B[rh];W[sf];B[qi];W[co]
;B[dn];W[hp]C[White hanes up firmly, also taking some profit.];B[ph];W[qo]LB[qc:a]C[The diagonal move of 'a' in the upper right corner is enticing, but Lee Changho may fear Black will form a huge moyo in the lower right, so he approaches the lower right corner first to break it up.];B[qc];W[pe]C[White's diagonal move in sente is very happy.];B[oe];W[qd]C[The exchange of B63 and W64 is dubious.];B[qp];W[po]

;B[rp];W[on];B[qq];W[nn]C[Through 92, White is out of trouble.];B[qb];W[pf];B[qj];W[nl]LB[mq:a]C[W96 jump strengthening is solid, White aims to invade at 'a'.];B[bn];W[mq]C[The invasion is very severe, Black is hard to handle.];B[mo]C[B99 is the strongest play.]
