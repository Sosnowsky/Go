;B[qn];W[eq];B[fp]C[The opening up to B9 is same as the game between Hu Yaoyu and me in round 1, only difference is that I took Black.];W[jp]LB[kq:a]C[W10: Hu Yaoyu elected to split at 'a' in that game. Later on after study, we thought Black is not bad. So in this game, Liu Shizhen plays the pincer of W10 instead.];B[lq];W[hp];B[fr]LB[fn:a]C[B13: Black can also consider to jump at 'a'.];W[hn];B[en]LB[fn:a][dr:b][fl:c]C[B15: The shape of B 'a' is better. If White still makes diagonal at 'b', Black can jump to 'c'.]
;W[dr];B[cq];W[cp];B[el];W[fm];B[fn]C[When White strikes with W20, Black is worried about the attachment and cut so Black attaches with B21, Black is a little painful.];W[gm];B[em];W[cl]C[Through W24, White opens up the situation.];B[lo];W[qq];B[qp]
;W[kn];B[ln];W[fj];B[ck];W[bk];B[ej];W[cj]LB[fk:a][ek:b]C[W34 is wrong order, White should first exchange W 'a' and B 'b', then play atari of W34.];B[dk]LB[fk:a]C[After the retreat of B35, White can't extend at 'a' any more.];W[bi]
;B[cm];W[bm];B[io]LB[kp:a]C[As to the strike of B39, I don't know why White takes tenuki? To double up at 'a' is clearly better than the real game.];W[fi];B[ho];W[kp];B[in];W[lp];B[mp];W[mq];B[nq];W[mr]
;B[no];W[jn];B[im];W[lr];B[jr];W[iq];B[hr];W[ir];B[is];W[kr]C[Through W58, Black makes himself thick and also gains some profit.];B[nr];W[kl]C[But the exchange of B59 and W60 should be preserved.]
;B[gk];W[rp]C[This way White couldn't play hane of W62 freely.];B[qr];W[qf]C[From W64 to B85, both sides elect to play big points, this looks like a close and long game.];B[ph];W[qo];B[rq];W[qm];B[qk];W[qc];B[qd];W[pc]

;B[rj];W[of];B[pg];W[pf];B[oj];W[nd];B[qg];W[rf];B[rg]C[Through B197, it leads to an exchange, Black is able to capture all right side and should be satisfied.];W[ba];B[bg];W[bc];B[ef]
;W[ge];B[dh];W[fg];B[je];W[sf];B[jc];W[ik];B[lm];W[fk];B[km];W[hq];B[gq];W[jq]
;B[gc];W[nk]C[W126 diving deeply into Black's territory is game-deciding move, but it seems White is still very thin.];B[il];W[lj];B[jk];W[jf];B[ie];W[ij];B[jj];W[ji];B[ii];W[hj];B[ki]
;W[jh];B[kj];W[mh];B[mi]LB[kh:a][kg:b][lk:c][mj:d][lg:e]C[B141 is the losing move! Black should press at 'a', next W 'b', B 'c', W 'd' and B 'e', this way White sinks into a bitter battle.];W[jl]C[Black overlooks the good cut of W142.];B[li];W[jm]C[B143 and W144 are miai points, White must get one.]
;B[ei]LB[ll:a]C[With B145, Black can't capture White, otherwise White can turn at 145, both sides are dangerous.];W[ll]C[After White attaches with W146, Black's territory is inadequate.];B[gh];W[hh];B[fl];W[ok];B[er];W[pk];B[oh];W[dq];B[ds]
