;B[jp]C[B7: Black forms "Kobayashi Fuseki" at the bottom, Cho Hunhyun aims to affect the opponent psychologically.];W[qn];B[po];W[rp]LB[pn:a][qo:b][on:c][pj:d]C[If W10 at 'a', then B 'b', W 'c' and B 'd', White can't be satisfied.];B[ql]LB[pl:a][pn:b]C[B11: Black can also pincer high at 'a' or press at 'b'.];W[qq]LB[pn:a][qo:b][ro:c]C[If W12 at 'a', then B 'b', W 'c' and B12, this is also playable, the play in the game fits exactly Kobayashi's taste, since he ardently loves territory.]
;B[qo];W[ro];B[pn];W[pr];B[oq];W[or];B[mq]C[Through B19, it forms a situation of White's territory vs. Black's outside influence.];W[qf];B[qe];W[pf];B[nd];W[pi];B[oj]LB[pm:a]C[B25 is a good move and indirectly prevents White from playing hane out at 'a'.]
;W[pj];B[pk];W[nh];B[mi];W[lg];B[kh]LB[fo:a]C[B29 and B31: Black continues to make the knight's moves, it is of great momentum. To jump at 'a' is eye-catching big point.];W[lc]C[W32: White starts to attack Black's upper right corner, both sides try to obtain sente.];B[le]LB[nc:a]C[B33: Black seeks tempo of playing, if Black strengthens at 'a', it seems White already have taken advantage.];W[kg]
;B[jh]C[The exchange of W34 and B35 is clearly to Black's advantage.];W[qc]C[W36: White inevitably will pound on Black.];B[qd];W[ob];B[pc];W[jg];B[ih]C[With the exchange of W40 and B41, White needs to have enough courage.];W[pb];B[qb];W[nc]LB[rb:a]C[W44: White strengthens himself first then aims to play counter-atari at 'a'.]
;B[mh]C[B45 is an asking move.];W[oe]LB[mg:a][nf:b]C[If W46 at 'a', then Black will peep at 'b', White is not comfortable. 

After this move, the game was closed for lunch break.];B[mg];W[mf];B[rc];W[me]C[Through W50, White gains but ends in gote.];B[gc]LB[fo:a]C[The corner-approaching point of B51 is very cunning, Black tries to obtain sente and reduce, both sides are eyeing for the good point at around 'a'.];W[re]
;B[rd];W[ic];B[id]C[B55: Black wants to make White over concentrated.];W[jc]C[W56: White wouldn't give Black any chance to borrow strength.];B[cf]LB[fo:a]C[The play of B57 appears greedy, Black can first jump to 'a' and see how White to answer, this is more positive.];W[df]C[After White attaches out with W58, Black already can't take tenuki.];B[dg];W[ef];B[ce];W[cd]
;B[ec];W[ed];B[fd];W[dc];B[gf];W[gg]C[W68 is a good move, Black can't exert power.];B[hf];W[ci];B[eg];W[ei]C[The turnaround of W70 and W72 is worth study.];B[fg]C[Through B73, White is not successful.];W[fl]C[W74 serves two purposes.]
;B[em]C[B75: Black has to give up territory race.];W[fp]C[The counterattack of W76 is inevitable, they destroy each other's territory.];B[cm];W[dn];B[el]C[The play of B77 and B79 is very relentless, White is also not stable.];W[fk];B[fm];W[gm];B[fo]C[B83 appears unreasonable but very practical, White also has some comprehension.];W[gh];B[ch]
;W[cj]LB[bi:a][fi:b]C[W86: If White descends at 'a', Black will crosscut at 'b', White is difficult to handle.];B[ek]C[The timing of B87 is excellent.];W[fj]LB[ej:a]C[W88: White certainly should bump at 'a'.];B[di];W[dj];B[ej]C[B89 and B91 are very sharp, White is difficult.];W[go];B[gn]
;W[hn];B[fn];W[hl]C[White has no other choice but to play the sequence from W92 to W96.];B[fi];W[gp];B[eh]C[B99: Black takes in sente and is very happy.];W[cl]LB[bl:a]C[W100: White still doesn't reinforce cleanly, later on Black can still play at 'a'.];B[ho]C[B101: Black pushes on in the flush of victory.];W[io];B[hp]
;W[ip];B[hq];W[im];B[eb];W[db];B[be];W[bd]C[After W100, White's upper left corner is ko-alive.];B[ep]C[Black captures through in sente with B111, Black's advantage is obvious.];W[dq];B[bb];W[fe];B[hd]
;W[ge]C[W116 is clearly a miscalculation.];B[kd];W[kc];B[de];W[gd];B[fc];W[hc];B[ee];W[gb];B[ea];W[da];B[he];W[bc]C[Through W128, White's situation is too miserable to see.]
