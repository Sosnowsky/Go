;B[nn];W[om];B[on];W[pn];B[pl];W[rk];B[rj];W[rl];B[qj];W[pm]C[The opening up to 28 is a very common variation of "Chinese Fuseki".];B[fo]LB[hq:a]C[B29: Black elects to jump rather than approach the corner in order to guard against White's invasion at 'a'.]
;W[ce]LB[dr:a][hq:b]C[W30: White can also protect the corner at 'a', securing the corner and also aiming to invade at 'b' later.];B[cq];W[dq];B[cp];W[co];B[dr]
(;W[eo]LB[er:a][cr:b][eq:c][do:d]C[W36: If White hanes at 'a', then Black can connect at 'b', W 'c' and Black cuts at 'd', White is unreasonable (see var a).];B[er];W[fn];B[go];W[dj];B[ef]C[B41 is a good move.];W[df]LB[dg:a][ec:b]C[W42: White normally will answer with the knight's move at 'a', but Black's attachment at 'b' makes White uncomfortable.]
;B[eg];W[dg];B[eh];W[fd];B[ej];W[di];B[ei];W[dk];B[ek];W[dl]LB[dh:a]C[W52: White wants to tenuki, but Black later can push through and cut at 'a' to make life in the corner.];B[lc]LB[pb:a][md:b]C[B53 is positive, if Black secures the corner with a jump at 'a', then Black can make the diagonal move at 'b', Black is not satisfied.]
;W[qc];B[pc];W[pb];B[qd];W[rb];B[rc];W[qb];B[rd];W[nd]LB[jc:a]C[W62 is not good, White should stand at 'a'.];B[lb];W[mb]LB[ld:a]C[W64: White should press at 'a'.]
;B[ic];W[jc];B[jb];W[id];B[ib];W[hc];B[le];W[nf]LB[hb:a]C[W72 jumping out is questionable, blocking at 'a' is the proper move, this way White is not bad.];B[hd]C[The cut of B73 is very severe.];W[gc];B[mc]
;W[nb];B[me];W[ne];B[he]LB[ge:a]C[B79: Black may consider to make the diagonal move at 'a'.];W[jf];B[if]LB[lg:a]C[B81 is careless, B81 at 'a' is the only move.];W[ig];B[hg];W[lg];B[mg]

(;W[mp]LB[mq:a][mr:b][jq:c]C[The attachment of W124 is the last losing move! if White knights at 'a', after B 'b', then White can attach at 'c', this variation is still very complicated.];B[mr];W[jm];B[kn];W[jo];B[jl];W[ip];B[kk];W[jq];B[hq]
