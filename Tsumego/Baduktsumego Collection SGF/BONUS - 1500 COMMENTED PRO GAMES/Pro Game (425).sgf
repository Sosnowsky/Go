Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[pd];W[dp]C[Luo Xihe is the representative among Chinese "small dragon" players, in the dan promotion tournament just ended, he successfully advanced to 9p, hope he can win this game and get into the main event.];B[qp];W[dc];B[fq]

;B[qo];W[ol];B[nl]LB[om:a][nm:b]C[The play of B21 is said to be Song TaeKon's unique study, since the common move is to B 'a' and W 'b'. Now Song TaeKon directly pincers here, it is a challenging attitude, see whether you dare extend at 'a'!];W[om];B[ok]LB[nm:a]C[In the real game, Luo Xihe's extension appears strong and unyielding, but in fact he seems to fall into trap. The fight following the cut of B23 is to Black's advantage. Therefore with W22, White should connect at 23, since White connects, Black still has to block at 22, next for White to cut at 'a' is normal.];W[qn];B[pn]LB[nm:a]C[W24 is an impulsive move, White should simply turn at 'a'. In the game, after the hane of B25, White incurs a little loss.]
;W[nm];B[pm]LB[op:a]C[B27 is a big questionable move! Black should strengthen at 'a', White also can't capture two black stones, this is clearly better than the real game.];W[mm];B[nk];W[oq];B[pr];W[po]C[W30 and W32 are good moves! Forcing Black to capture by reducing liberties, Black is painful.];B[rq];W[no];B[on]C[But next the play of W34 is inexplicable, after Black pushes with B35, White instead can tight Black's liberty. Why White not block at 35 in sente?];W[ko]
;B[lk];W[qf];B[oo];W[lq];B[np];W[jq];B[kp];W[jp];B[kr];W[jn];B[lp];W[mo];B[mp]C[From B39 to B49, Black captures one stone at a time, the speed is slow but it is substantial.]
;W[jk]C[The cap of W50 is the vital point and can't be missed.];B[qh]C[B51 appears unreasonable, in fact it is a good move to attack in order to defend, it is not good to simply escape several stones.];W[ph];B[rj];W[qd];B[qc];W[pc];B[od];W[rc];B[qb];W[nd];B[ne]
;W[pe];B[oe];W[rb];B[pb];W[qg];B[qi];W[pi];B[og];W[rg];B[ri];W[pg]C[The handling sequence from W54 to W72 shows Luo Xihe's talent. Especially the bump of W60 makes life completely the original weak stones and avoids the hidden trouble.];B[di];W[ck]
;B[dr]C[After B75, the situation is about even.];W[cg];B[hd]C[B77 is a very brilliant move! Instead of escaping B73 heavily,  it is better to wait and see how White to attack this one stone.];W[fp];B[gq];W[mh];B[li];W[ji];B[lh];W[he];B[id];W[ie]
;B[je];W[jf];B[jd];W[kg];B[km];W[kl];B[lg];W[lf];B[mg];W[ge]C[From W84 to W96, White clearly wants to capture big, since White's territory is already not enough if capturing small.

As an observer, watching these several moves may be very relaxing, but as to the players, in the real game, since not being to see the life-and-death of the big capture, it needs a big courage to make this kind of decision.];B[dk]C[B97: Black must make life all stones in order to win the game. As to this extremely complicated situation, it is very difficult to see life-and-death, let's see mistakes from both sides.];W[cj]
;B[hm];W[hn];B[ij];W[ik];B[gn];W[gm];B[hl];W[hk];B[gl];W[in];B[dm];W[fn];B[fm]
;W[fo]C[W110 and W112 are strong moves to destroy eyes, if knowing this earlier, Black's eye shape will be better if Black takes at 111 with B109.];B[cm];W[bn];B[el];W[dj];B[ej];W[fk];B[ek];W[en];B[gk];W[cl];B[hj];W[jj]
;B[fh];W[gi];B[ci];W[bg]C[When W126 and W128, Black is already very dangerous.];B[fi];W[gj]LB[dh:a]C[But just at this time, it is said Luo Xihe went into a 40-minute thinking tank, finally cut with W130 resolutely and wanted to declare Black's death penalty. But from the opponent's astonishing impression, Luo Xihe found out he played in the wrong place ... Luo Xihe original calculation is to make diagonal at 'a'!];B[ch]C[Due to this incident, after B131, White can't capture Black.

So far, logically Black will win by resignation.];W[mf];B[nf];W[ld]C[But Go is that interesting, Luo Xihe first is struggling in non-important places with W132 and W134, and W132 is a not absolute sente move!]
;B[lc];W[eq];B[er]LB[bm:a]C[Song TaeKon thought Luo Xihe already lost fighting spirit, after Luo Xihe played W136, Song TaeKon answers with B137 incautiously.

In fact with B137 if Black simply makes life at 'a', Black will win the game.];W[fj]C[After White plays the clever move of W138, the situation has been turned around again.];B[bm];W[ak];B[ai];W[aj];B[an];W[ao];B[al]
;W[bi];B[bo]LB[dn:a]C[When B147, if W136 doesn't exist, Black can push at 'a'!];W[co];B[dg];W[bh];B[df];W[ee])
