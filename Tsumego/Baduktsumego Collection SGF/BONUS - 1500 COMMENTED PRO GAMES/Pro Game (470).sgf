Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[In the title match 2 of 31st Gosei best-of-5 series, the defending champion Cho U 9p took White and defeated the challenger Yoda Norimoto 9p by resignation, taking a 2:0 lead.];W[pp];B[cd];W[cp];B[ec]
;W[eq];B[cj];W[od];B[md]C[The opening is steady.];W[pg]C[However, as to the tight pincer of B9, the set pattern following W10 is rare.];B[oe];W[ne];B[nd];W[pe];B[oc];W[of];B[pd]
;W[qm];B[me]C[B19: Black is able to take the vital point and turn the head, Black has nothing to complain.];W[jp]C[As to Black's moyo, White is still not hasty and cultivate his own moyo with W20, showing Cho U's confidence.];B[co]C[Following B21, Black settles the shape in sente.];W[do];B[cn];W[bp];B[dn];W[eo];B[pq]C[Then Black destroys territory with B27, it shows Yoda lacks confidence in territory race.];W[qq]
;B[oq]C[However, Black also can't enclose the top with just one move, so Black simply allows White to come and reduce territory.];W[qr];B[op];W[po];B[lq];W[kr];B[kq];W[jq];B[lr];W[fd];B[ed];W[fe];B[gb]C[As to the shoulder-hit of W38, after the attachment of B39, the knight of B41 is common, however with B39, I feel for Black to make the knight with B41 is better.]
;W[ei]C[When W42, Black has no good tactic to separate.];B[dk];W[ci];B[bi];W[ch];B[bh];W[cg]C[After White connects together from W44 to W48, it forms a close game.];B[hd]C[Of course, the knight of B49 is a good point.];W[fj]C[White reinforces himself steadily with W50, this shows young players' confidence in the second half of the game.];B[jr]LB[ql:a]C[The atari of B51 is very big, certainly for Black to directly attach at 'a' is more positive, this way White is difficult at the top and bottom.]
;W[ir];B[ks];W[qe];B[ql];W[qj]C[In the game, after White has the block of W54, Black attaches, White can pincer attack.];B[rm];W[qn];B[ol];W[mf];B[lf];W[lg];B[kf];W[ie]
;B[he];W[hf]C[W60 to W66 are related good moves, aiming to attack Black on the right side and also taking chance to reduce Black's territory.];B[id];W[je];B[jd];W[ke];B[le];W[kd];B[kc];W[ig]C[Through W74, White has potential in the center, the game will be subject to White's development in the center.];B[rk];W[kg]
;B[jf];W[if];B[oe];W[nf];B[pj];W[rd];B[rc];W[od];B[lc];W[qi]LB[hr:a][pi:b][jg:c][jh:d][gf:e]C[Now Black has several choices, 1, to directly pincer at 'a', it is huge, this way Black will lead in territory and watch how White to attack Black on the right side; 2, to reinforce himself by pressing at 'b', and also aim at White's weakness in the center by B 'c', W 'd' and B 'e'. 3, directly pound White's center. As to Yoda who has favorable consciousness, the first and third play is worry some, this way the second play is relatively clever.]

;W[am]C[White settles the shape following W100.];B[bg];W[ce];B[cf];W[df];B[bf];W[de];B[be];W[hq]C[After W108, the situation becomes unclear.];B[re]C[B109 is big.];W[rf];B[sd]
;W[mj]C[W112: White starts to cultivate the center.];B[nl];W[lj];B[jn]LB[kk:a][kj:b][jl:c]C[The jump of B115 is strange, Black should play at 'a', next W 'b' and B 'c', White is not easy to enclose big territory in the center.];W[il];B[di];W[dh];B[dj];W[fh]
;B[pi];W[em]C[The jump of W122 makes Black very painful!];B[dl];W[bl];B[cl];W[bk];B[bj]C[From B123 to B127, Black plays consecutive dame moves.];W[in]C[Through W138, White completely encloses the center, Black's small defeat already can't be altered.];B[jm];W[im]C[In this game, Cho U elects to fight bravely and wins another game.];B[en]
