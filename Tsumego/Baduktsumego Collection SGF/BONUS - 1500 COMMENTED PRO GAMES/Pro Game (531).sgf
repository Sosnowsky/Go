;W[cn];B[kq];W[qj];B[qg];W[qm];B[pk]C[B11 is Yu Bin's most commonly used opening recently.];W[op]LB[qk:a][pn:b]C[W12: Normally White will block at 'a', Black also will make knight at 'b'. In the game, White seeks variation.];B[pn];W[qq];B[rq]
;W[qo];B[pq];W[po];B[qr];W[on];B[qk]C[However, through B21, White incurs a little loss.];W[ko];B[om];W[nn]LB[ip:a]C[The exchange of B23 and W24 seems to make White thick, for Black to simply make knight at 'a' is better.];B[ip];W[jc]

;W[ch];B[dg];W[db];B[ed];W[de];B[dc];W[cb];B[id]C[The set pattern from B35 to B47 is simple and practical.];W[jd];B[ie];W[fg];B[fi];W[ic]
;B[ge];W[kf];B[ig]C[Through B55, Black's tempo is good.];W[gi];B[fh];W[gh];B[gg]LB[gb:a][gj:b][lc:c]C[But B57 and B59 are bad moves! Black wanted to force White to reinforce and make life, but Black overlooked his own well-being, and White can also fly to 'a' to strengthen, which will threaten Black's eye shape. With B57 Black should play hane at 'b', after W58, Black can take tenuki and grab the big point at 'c', this result is clearly better.];W[fj];B[dh]
;W[ej];B[bj];W[bk];B[cj]LB[bh:a][ci:b][aj:c][ai:d]C[B65: Black should clamp at 'a' to make life, next B65, B 'b', W 'c', B 'd' initiating ko, since Black has two local ko threats, and White's corner is not alive, so Black is not fearful of this ko fight. In the game, it becomes seki and Black incurs loss.];W[bh];B[df];W[ee];B[dj];W[dk]
;B[af];W[gb]LB[aj:a]C[W72: White should immediately play hane-and-connect at 'a', later on when Black captures W60 and W62, their value becomes smaller.];B[gj];W[hj];B[gk];W[hk];B[da];W[bb];B[hb];W[hc];B[cc];W[bc]
;B[ae];W[ca];B[gc];W[ga]LB[aa:a]C[The descent of W86 is not necessary, White should simply strengthen at 'a' to make life.];B[fb];W[ec];B[gl];W[jh];B[ih];W[ii];B[fa];W[hl]

;W[rc];B[qe];W[nd];B[pb]C[White's play from W100 to B111 is too risky! White first loses a big corner, then White comes to kill Black's big group, Black has many choices. This is perhaps Gu Li's style.];W[gf];B[hg]LB[hf:a][hd:b][ff:c][fe:d][eg:e][gd:f]C[B113 is not simple and clear, Black should play atari at 'a', next W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 'e' and W 'f', this way White's gain is limited and plus White already paid the price of the upper-right corner, Black is clearly favorable.];W[hf]
;B[lc];W[if];B[je]C[B117: In the game, Black already can't push any more.];W[ld];B[ke];W[kd];B[le];W[md];B[kb];W[jb];B[qb];W[nf];B[mg]
;W[jg];B[nh];W[pf];B[lf];W[rb];B[ra];W[mb];B[mc];W[lb];B[sb]LB[kc:a]C[B137: Black didn't elect to connect at 'a' in order to tight White one more liberty.];W[kc];B[ob]
;W[pg];B[nm]LB[oi:a]C[The original move of B141 is to connect at 'a', but perhaps Yu Bin thinks his situation is not optimistic, so Black's play is very strong and unyielding.];W[oi];B[kg];W[jf];B[mj];W[nk];B[ll];W[mm];B[ml];W[nl];B[qn]
;W[ni];B[mi];W[lh];B[ki];W[kh];B[mh];W[ok];B[lm];W[mn];B[pj];W[qh];B[ro]C[Through B163, Black crosses over and gains a big territory. If Black's big dragon can make life, Black is leading in territory.];W[io]
;B[jm];W[jp];B[hm];W[ei]LB[el:a]C[W168 is the losing move of this game, if White hang at 'a', Black's big dragon is very dangerous.];B[jq];W[hp];B[iq];W[hn];B[gq];W[fo];B[il];W[jk]

;W[fp];B[em]C[Through B191, White already can't kill Black.];W[eq]C[W192: White turns to play endgame, Black is a little favorable for the game.];B[mp];W[lp];B[lq];W[jo];B[cm];W[bm];B[dn];W[co];B[rg]
