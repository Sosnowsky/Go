;W[cn];B[jp];W[pn];B[qo];W[qj];B[ql]C[The invasion of B11 is a positive move.];W[qf];B[ol]C[B13: Black tenukis and jumps out to put pressure on W8.];W[nc];B[oe];W[ph]LB[qc:a][pg:b]C[W16: White first protects the right side, it is a good sequence. If White directly enters the corner at 'a', after being knight-pressed by B 'b', White would not have any good move left on the right side.]

;B[np];W[mo];B[mp]C[Black has killed White and obtained a lot of territory, Black also has become very thick.];W[pl];B[pk];W[pm]C[Although White gets out of trouble with W46 and W48, but White's shape is not good.];B[qk];W[ok];B[pj];W[oh];B[ni];W[nk]
;B[rj]C[After Black makes eye with B55, White is clearly in an inferior position.];W[lk];B[rh];W[qg];B[qi]LB[ri:a][sk:b][rg:c][oi:d]C[B59 is slow. Black absolutely should tenuki to grab big points. If White connects at 59, then B 'a' and W 'b', next Black can crawl at 'c' to make White suffer, next get out at 'd'. White doesn't have any severe tactic to attack Black.];W[me]C[W60 is a good move!

After this move, it is time for noon break.];B[mf];W[md]
;B[nf];W[lf];B[lg];W[kf];B[kg];W[jf];B[jg];W[if]C[Through W70, all of sudden White has developed a big moyo at the top, however Black still has to struggle to make life, Black has suffered a big loss.];B[pb];W[og];B[nm]

Chang Hao explains that if White directly makes the diagonal's extension at 'a', then B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f', W 'g', B 'h', W 'i', B 'j' and W 'n', now if there has no W74, Black can cap at 'k', White's key stones will get killed (see var a). However after the exchange of W74 and B 'l', if Black pushes at 'k', White can atari at 'm', successfully saving his key stones (see var b).]
;B[nh];W[ln];B[fc];W[of];B[ne];W[ec]C[W80 is greedy.];B[jc];W[kd];B[fd]C[After Black makes the three-space extension inside White's territory, White is not happy.];W[hc];B[mb];W[nb]
;B[kc];W[ic];B[mc];W[ld];B[nd];W[jd];B[kb]C[Next Black's sequence from B85 to B93 is again very good, White is not optimistic.];W[df];B[hh]LB[cc:a][cd:b][eb:c][ff:d]C[B95 is too conservative. Black first should play the asking move at 'a'. If White still elects to block at 'b', then Black can play at B 'c' in sente and jump to 'd'.]

(;W[cb]LB[be:a][gb:b][hb:c][dc:d]C[W120 is the right move. If White plays the strong move at 'a', then B 'b', W 'c' and B 'd', Black can make life (see var a).];B[bc];W[dc];B[cq];W[dq];B[dr];W[cp];B[br];W[bq]

;W[en];B[fm];W[bl];B[bm];W[dl]C[W144 and W146 are tesujis!];B[ck];W[dm]C[After White connects back with W148, originally White was attacked inside Black's influence, now White has basically settled down.];B[jl];W[oi];B[cg];W[cf];B[dk]

(;B[al]LB[bk:a][an:b][ap:c]C[B177: Normally Black will answer with the atari at 'a', however this way W 'b' is sente, Black has to play at 'c', White can descend at 177 to capture one black stone (see var a). ];W[dh];B[ch];W[ei]LB[dj:a][ci:b][bi:c][ej:d][bj:e][ao:f]C[In the game after the atari of B177, W178 and W180 are good moves. If Black connects at 'a', then W 'b', if Black ataris at 'c', B 'd' will be sente (see var a); If Black makes the diagonal's extension at 'e', W 'f' becomes sente, Black is very painful (see var b)!]

(;B[oj]LB[ja:a][ib:b][fn:c][ep:d]TR[hm][hl][gm]C[B185 is the last losing move. Black should first make the diagonal's extension at 'a', forcing White to connect at 'b' (now Black has many ko threats, White dare not start a ko), then squeeze at 'c', forcing White to play at 'd' and making sure to capture the marked three stones (see var a).];W[nj];B[ng];W[ki]LB[fn:a][gn:b][ik:c]C[In the game, after White has played W188, if Black squeezes at 'a' now, White can connect at 'b', if Black separates White, White can connect back by the diagonal's extension at 'c'.]
;B[qd];W[rd];B[rb];W[rc];B[qa];W[rg];B[pe];W[sf];B[ja];W[ka]C[W198 is a clever move! Black will end in gote if not playing the ko, but because White has just wasted all his ko threats, playing the ko leads to the sudden death of the big dragon on the right side.];B[ib];W[jb];B[kh]
