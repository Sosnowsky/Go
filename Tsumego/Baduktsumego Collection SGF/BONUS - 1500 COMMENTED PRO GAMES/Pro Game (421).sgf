;W[po]C[W6: White continues to approach the other corner, this is also Teacher Cho's fast opening style.];B[fc];W[of];B[qg];W[id]C[After Black approaches the corner with B7, W10 invading now seems a little far-fetched. However Teacher Cho's play is powerful, can't relax your vigilance!];B[cf];W[fd];B[gd];W[fe];B[ec];W[dc];B[ge]

(;W[gf]LB[df:a][dg:b][de:c][ed:d][hc:e]TR[kd]C[W18: The joseki is W 'a', B 'b', W18, B 'c', W 'd' and B 'e', due to the addition of the marked black stone, Black has no reason to be no good (see var a).];B[hf];W[df];B[ie];W[cg];B[mc]LB[dg:a]C[Before the forcing move of B23, Black should first cut at 'a' to probe White, later on Black would be easier to find ko threats.]
;W[qc];B[rc];W[pd];B[qe];W[rb]C[Then I didn't expect White immediately would start the ko with the hane of W28, this is also Teacher Cho's sharp style.];B[qb];W[pb];B[pc];W[lc];B[ld];W[qc];B[dg];W[qa]
;B[ch];W[bg];B[de];W[ef];B[ce]TR[oc][of]C[In the exchange from B35 to B4, both sides have gained, but White turns the two weak marked stone into thickness, White's gain should be bigger.];W[ed];B[bh];W[gc];B[hc];W[gb];B[hb]

(;W[nq]LB[np:a][pn:b]C[The hit of W74 is tight, if White simply jumps to 'a', then B 'b', W74 and B 'c', White can't be satisfied (see var a).];B[op];W[oo];B[np];W[no];B[mp];W[qn];B[mo];W[qm];B[ql]
(;W[nm]LB[pl:a][pk:b][ol:c][qk:d][ok:e][pj:f][jq:g]C[The jump of W84 is a mistake! After the game, Teacher Cho said White should cut at 'a', then B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f', then White invades at 'g', this way the game would be very complicated (see var a).];B[rn];W[rm];B[rq]C[The two hanes of B85 and B87 are severe, although it is a ko, but White is too heavy!

;B[rg];W[ri];B[pg];W[ns]LB[sl:a][sn:b][qk:c]C[The turn of W128 is the losing move! White should play the atari at 'a', although Black wouldn't connect at 'a', but the tactic of B 'c' is no longer working, this way although the game is still to Black's advantage, but the road to victory or defeat is still very long.];B[qk]C[The hit of B129 is a very joyful move.];W[pj]LB[rk:a][rj:b]C[W130: If White blocks at 'a', then Black can atari at 130 in sente, White can't tolerate, White as a whole would be not alive. But After W130, Black cuts with B 'a' and B 'b', White is not good either.];B[rk]
;W[sl];B[rj];W[sn];B[ok];W[ro]C[Through W136, it lead to an exchange, but in this exchange, Black not only has gained a lot of points, but also Black has no more weak group on the board, in this situation, White's turnaround is basically impossible.
