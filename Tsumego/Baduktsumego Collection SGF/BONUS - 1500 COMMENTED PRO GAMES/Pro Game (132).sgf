;W[ed];B[qo];W[oc];B[jc];W[qh];B[ql];W[pe];B[qe];W[pf]LB[qf:a]C[W14: White can consider to play hane at 'a', because B9 is relatively far away, it should work.];B[qf];W[pg];B[qb]

(;B[dg]LB[ch:a][di:b][ci:c][dj:d][cj:e][dk:f][ge:g]C[The push and cut of B23 is unreasonable, as a result Black sinks into a bitter battle. With B23 Black should crawl at 'a', next W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 'e', W 'f' and B 'g', this way Black's stone efficiency will be adequate and Black should have nothing to complain (see var a).];W[eg];B[ef];W[ff];B[ee]LB[eh:a][fg:b]C[Black surprisingly escapes with B27. However if Black plays atari at 'a', next White takes at 27 and Black plays counter-atari at 'b', this way Black also seems very risky.]
;W[de];B[fe];W[fd];B[ge];W[gd];B[cf];W[dd];B[hd];W[he];B[gf];W[cd];B[ch];W[eh]C[Through W40, Black fights painfully.]
;B[gh]LB[cj:a][id:b][ie:c][hg:d]C[The shape of B41 is not right, still to simply jump at 'a' is better. If White plays atari at 'b' then connects at 'c', Black can make the diagonal at 'd', this variation is better than the real game.];W[dj];B[cj];W[id];B[hc];W[ie];B[gj];W[hi]LB[gg:a]C[After White strikes with W48, White is left with a good move of playing wedge at 'a', at the top Black's four stones are already very dangerous.]
;B[gi];W[ck];B[bj];W[fk];B[gk];W[fm];B[dk]LB[eb:a][db:b][kb:c]C[B55 is a questionable move. Black should make the knight's move at 'a', next W 'b' and Black can first make life by playing diagonal at 'c', now giving White any chance to take advantage easily.];W[dl]C[The sequence following W56 is quite simple and clear.];B[di]
;W[gg];B[hf];W[if];B[hg];W[ig];B[hh];W[ek];B[ei];W[jb]C[Through W66, White captures four black stones, White obtains a huge advantage at one stroke.];B[fq];W[bp];B[co];W[bo]

;W[nr];B[mr];W[nq];B[np];W[mp];B[no];W[ro]LB[rq:a]C[White first plays hane with W90, originally White wants to strengthen the corner in sente, but White ignores Black's tactic following B 'a', the effect is just the opposite.];B[rn];W[lq];B[lr];W[kq]C[The play of W92 and W94 is very interesting.]
;B[kr]LB[lp:a][mo:b][kp:c]C[B95: If Black plays atari at 'a', followed by W 'b' and B 'c', Black is favorable for the ladder; However White can turn at 95, sacrificing two stones in the middle, the situation will become very simple as White wishes.];W[jq];B[mo];W[lp];B[jr]C[Black has no other choice but to crawl on the second line following B95.];W[iq];B[ir];W[hq];B[hr]
;W[gq];B[gr];W[gn];B[rq]C[Locally White scores again, however the strike-killing of B107 is very intense. It seems Lee Sedol has miscalculated over here.];W[rp]C[In this crucial moment, Lee Sedol has selected the correct route.];B[qq];W[rr]LB[qr:a][rs:b][pr:c][sr:d]C[W110: If White plays hane at 'a', next B110, W 'b', B 'c' and W 'd', it will lead to ko-killing, but Black can play two consecutive moves on the outside, its effect is obvious, so the sacrificing play in the real game is better.];B[qr]
;W[pr];B[sr];W[pp];B[rs];W[qn]C[Although locally White dies unconditionally, but the cut of W116 is severe, White can fight adequately.];B[pn];W[qm];B[rm];W[pm];B[nm];W[pl];B[qk];W[pk]
;B[ri]LB[qj:a][pj:b][qi:c][pi:d][rh:e][lm:f]C[B125: If Black extends at 'a', followed by W 'b', B 'c', W 'd' and B 'e', after crossing over, in terms of territory, it is better than the real game, however next White can strike at 'f', Black will be hard to handle.];W[qj];B[rj];W[rh];B[qi];W[pi];B[pj]
;W[oj];B[qj];W[ok];B[oi];W[ph];B[rg];W[lm]C[The strike of W138 is still the vital point, Black is in a losing situation.];B[kn];W[km];B[ml];W[mk];B[jn];W[ln]
;B[lo];W[sh];B[sl];W[ko];B[ll];W[mm];B[jo];W[nn]LB[kp:a]C[W152: White can connect at 'a', Black will be even more difficult to deal with.];B[on];W[nl];B[mn];W[om]
