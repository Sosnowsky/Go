;W[qf]C[W6 first approaching is a trend.];B[nc];W[ce];B[dd];W[cd];B[ec];W[cf];B[db]LB[qe:a][pf:b][qj:c]C[B13: Black can also consider to bump at 'a', if W 'b', then Black can pincer at 'c', taking the initiative.];W[cc]

;W[cl];B[lq];W[dr];B[cr]LB[mp:a]C[B31: Black seems to be taken advantage, Black can take tenuki and first make the diagonal at 'a' to capture one white stone, in the lower left corner White doesn't have any powerful follow-up maneuver.];W[no];B[fr];W[hp];B[er];W[or];B[pl];W[pk];B[oq]
;W[nr];B[pm];W[nl]LB[lo:a]C[W42 is an overplay. The original move is to cap at 'a', taking one black stone, White is not bad for the whole game.];B[ok];W[qk];B[lo]C[The jump of B45 is severe, but Black shouldn't exchange B43 and W44.

;W[qp];B[qo];W[rp];B[rs]LB[rr:a][qs:b]C[B67: Black can elect to clamp at 'a', next White plays hane at 67 and Black can capture at 'b', leading to a ko, considering Black has local ko threats, in this variation White is a little far-fetched.];W[rr];B[qs];W[sq];B[nn]C[The counterattack of B71 is strong and unyielding, but next Gu Li fails to release the best move.];W[oo];B[po]

;W[nk];B[nm];W[jm];B[so];W[kc]C[White invades with W84, White's advantage is obvious.];B[ic]LB[hc:a]C[B85 leaves defect, to make the diagonal at 'a' is the original move.];W[ke];B[ld];W[kd];B[pf];W[qe]

;B[kh];W[le];B[ki];W[jj];B[qg];W[mh];B[rg];W[kj]LB[ni:a]C[Afterwards, the attachment of W136 is not careful and precise enough, White should connect by the small diagonal at 'a'.];B[fh];W[gh];B[ni];W[nh]
