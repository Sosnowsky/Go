Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[pd]C[In the quarter final of 9th LG Cup, Yu Bin 9p turned the game around on the edge of collapse by capitalizing major mistakes from his opponents.];W[dd];B[pq];W[dq];B[do]
;W[co];B[cn];W[cp];B[cf];W[fc];B[dn];W[fq];B[dj]C[Yu Bin guessed Black, the opening up to B13 is steady.];W[po];B[pl];W[mp];B[nq]LB[oo:a]C[As to the pincer of B15, W16 is White's own wishful thinking, White thinks Black will attach out at 'a', B17 is a good move.]
;W[np];B[mq];W[lp];B[lq];W[kp];B[pi]C[Through B23, the variation is to Black's advantage, Black is successful in the opening.];W[nc];B[pf];W[qc];B[pc];W[pb];B[qd];W[rb]
;B[rc];W[qb]C[The local variation comes to an end from W24 to W32.];B[cd]C[Black attaches the corner with B33 to set the shape, Black is relatively thick.];W[cc];B[bc];W[ce];B[bd];W[de]LB[be:a]C[W38: If White pushes down at 'a', it will lead to a fierce fight.];B[be];W[df];B[dg]
;W[eg];B[dh];W[kd];B[gc]C[The attachment of B45 is a bold move, it seems White can't capture this black stone.];W[hc];B[gd];W[gb];B[hb];W[ib];B[hd]C[With the sequence from W46 to B51, White is hard to choose whether to connect or take, Black still keeps the lead.];W[ic];B[dc]LB[fb:a]C[As to the connection of W52, with B53 it is always better for Black to first cut and atari at 'a'.]
;W[eb];B[qq]LB[ef:a][ed:b][ff:c]C[B55 is slow, Black should cut at 'a', after W 'b', next the extension at 'c' is imperative.];W[kq];B[go];W[ff];B[cb]LB[fh:a]C[In the game, after White hangs with W58, it leads to Black's questionable move of B59, this is clearly a gote move, Black should jump to 'a'.];W[fi];B[if]LB[ig:a]C[B61 is heavy, Black should reduce by retreating one line at 'a'.]
;W[ih]C[After White attacks with W62, the center becomes White's influence, Black's slight advantage all disappears.];B[kf];W[kh];B[mf];W[ni];B[nl]C[B67: Black really doesn't know how to answer and has to take tenuki.];W[ng]C[White pounds at Black weakness with the sequence following W68, Black becomes thin.];B[nd];W[pg];B[oc];W[qf];B[mc]LB[of:a]C[Next B73 looks small, to extend at 'a' is the shape.]
;W[rd];B[re];W[sc];B[qe];W[of];B[id];W[kc];B[ke]LB[ld:a][oe:b]C[It looks normal for Black to strengthen with B79 and B81, but in fact after White turns at 'a', Black is very difficult to answer. With B79, it is better for Black to strengthen at 'b'.];W[qj]C[In the game, White reinforces with the sequence following W82, as a result, Black seems not stable any more.];B[pj]
;W[qi];B[qk];W[ph];B[qo];W[qn];B[rj];W[ri];B[pn];W[oo];B[rn];W[qp];B[ro];W[eh]
;B[di];W[bn];B[bm];W[bo];B[ij]LB[gq:a]C[B101 is a bad move, now Black should attach down at 'a', this is just the place for fighting, because White's group on the right side is still not settled down.];W[hf]LB[ld:a]C[White strengthens with W102 and also aims at Black's weakness at 'a', Black is difficult to play.];B[lh]C[The sequence from B103 and B113 is game-deciding moves, but they seem unreasonable, however in terms of result, they are lucky winning moves.];W[lg];B[mg]
;W[mh];B[li];W[kg];B[nf];W[oe];B[ig];W[hg];B[hh];W[jf]C[The wedge of W114 is an excellent move, Black has no follow-up.];B[mi];W[nh];B[ie];W[lf]
;B[le];W[me]LB[je:a]C[But the atari of W120 is an overplay. White should simply push at 'a', Black wouldn't have any answer.];B[ne];W[je];B[ld];W[jg];B[rf]C[In the game, after Black makes one eye in sente, Black turns with B125 to attack White instead, the situation is complicated.];W[pe];B[rg];W[hi]LB[nb:a][od:b][qh:c]C[The play of W128 is indeed inexplicable! White should extend at 'a', next B 'b' and W 'c', fighting with Black in a capturing race.]
;B[qg]C[After B129, White instead is captured, instantly the situation has been turned around.
