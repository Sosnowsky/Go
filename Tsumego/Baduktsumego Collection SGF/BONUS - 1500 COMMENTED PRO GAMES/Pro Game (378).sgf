;B[ci]LB[ic:a]C[B7: Black can also consider to extend at 'a'.];W[nc];B[lc];W[ic];B[nd];W[cn]LB[od:a]C[With the approaching move of W12, White prepares to wedge at 'a' later on.];B[co];W[dn];B[fp];W[ck]
;B[ej];W[el];B[ef];W[od];B[oc]LB[oe:a]C[The play of B21 is rarely seen when White is favorable in the ladder, Black's usual play is to atari at 'a'.];W[oe];B[pc];W[md];B[nb];W[ne]C[Through 26, White can be satisfied.];B[qf]LB[mb:a][mc:b][ob:c]C[After B27, White is still left with the maneuver of starting a ko by W 'a', B 'b' and W 'c'.]
;W[cd];B[id]LB[be:a]C[B29: For Black to stand at 'a' is common sense, the play in the game leads to a fierce fight.];W[jd]C[W30: White is not willing to give way a tiny step.];B[jc];W[hc];B[je];W[kd];B[ld];W[ke];B[le];W[kf]
;B[lf];W[oh];B[kg];W[kc];B[og]C[B43 is ferocious and ruthless, Black has taken the initiative.];W[ng];B[jf];W[jb];B[kb];W[jc];B[pg];W[nh];B[lg]LB[qi:a][of:b]C[B51 is questionable, Black certainly should make the knight's move at 'a', followed by W 'b' and B 51.]
;W[ph]C[W52 is a good move, Black is not comfortable.];B[qh];W[qi];B[qj]LB[rh:a][qg:b][pi:c][rj:d][ri:e][ok:f][qe:g][nf:h]C[B55 is a surprisingly strong move, and it is also a tricky play, if White ataris at 'a' impulsively, then after B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e' and B 'f', Black's weak point at 'g' would be gone, so Black may wedge at 'h', White is clearly not good (see var a).]
(;W[pi]C[White elects to simply connect with W56, White didn't fall into the trap.];B[rj];W[ri];B[ok];W[of]C[W60: White is very happy to prevent the wedge and cut with sente.]
(;B[qe]LB[mb:a][re:b][pf:c][qg:d][rd:e]C[B61: If Black draws back at 'a', then W 61, B 'b', W 'c', B 'd' and W 'e', Black is no good.];W[mb];B[lb]C[B63: Black couldn't resist.];W[ob];B[pb];W[na]C[Through 66, Black has failed in the fight.];B[mj]C[B67: Black again starts a fierce attack.]
;W[rh];B[qg];W[nk];B[nj];W[pj]C[W70 and W72 are in excellent order.];B[ql];W[pk];B[pl];W[ol];B[oj];W[om]C[Through 78, Black instead becomes the defendant, White takes the initiative.];B[qn]
;W[pn];B[qo];W[qk]C[W82 is a good move.]
