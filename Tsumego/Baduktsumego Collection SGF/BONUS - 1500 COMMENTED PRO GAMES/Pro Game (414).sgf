;B[cn];W[cp];B[dm]LB[fq:a][cf:b]C[Black hangs with B21, hoping White will jump to 'a', but it is somewhat his own wishful thinking. For Black to make double-approach at 'b' is more positive.];W[cf]C[W22 is alert, in the lower-right corner Black is thick and in a low position, the value at the bottom is already small.];B[fp];W[eo]LB[dc:a][fr:b]C[The play of W24 is a little inexplicable, White is being ataried into a heavy group. For White to double-up at 'a' or simply make knight at 'b' is all not a bad choice.];B[ep];W[dp]
;B[fo];W[dn];B[en];W[do];B[em];W[fr];B[gr]C[The attachment of B33 is strong move!];W[gq];B[er];W[hr];B[eq];W[ip];B[bn]
;W[dr];B[es];W[br]C[Through W42, at a glance White gets to play on both sides and can be satisfied. However, White's thinness on the outside and the corner extortion is a price White has to pay sooner or later.];B[ci];W[dc];B[kq]C[B45: Black continues to attack.];W[op]C[W46: White can't end in gote again here.];B[oq];W[lc]LB[gn:a][fn:b]C[But before the extension of W48, White should make exchange of W 'a' and B 'b', this way White is much easier to handle the lower side.]
;B[iq];W[hq];B[jp]C[B49 and B51 are good moves!];W[ir]LB[io:a]C[In the game White is being sealed off by Black and can't tolerate, with W52 White can only extend out at 'a'.];B[io];W[jq];B[hp];W[kp];B[iq];W[jr];B[ko]
;W[lp];B[lq];W[mp];B[mq];W[gp];B[ho];W[gs]C[Through W66, Black is clearly favorable.];B[nl];W[ok];B[on]LB[jc:a]C[B69 is a careless move, giving White sente. Black should invade at 'a', trying to take initiative.];W[om]C[The push of W70 is good move!]
;B[rn];W[rm]C[Sacrificing several stones is painful, but at this situation, sente is much more important!];B[pn];W[qm];B[nn];W[pf]LB[qf:a][pc:b]C[W76: White pounds on Black, if Black blocks at 'a', then White will strike at 'b', Black has no answer.];B[pg]LB[oe:a][qf:b][of:c][jc:d]C[But the attachment of B77 is over zealous! Now Black should make knight at 'a', next W 'b', B 'c', W77, then Black invades at 'd', this way Black can still keep the lead.]
;W[od];B[oc];W[pd];B[pc];W[qe]C[White's sequence from W78 to W82 is crude but very effective!];B[of]C[Following B83 Black has no other alternative.];W[qc];B[rd];W[re];B[rc];W[qb];B[rb]

;B[nb];W[lb];B[qa]C[Through B105, Black captures several stones, but Black's gain is very limited, on the outside White builds a steal wall. Black incurs a big loss!];W[nm]C[After this variation, White turns the game around and becomes favorable again.];B[mn];W[gf]LB[dh:a]C[In a favorable situation, Heyang makes several mistakes. W108 is questionable move, to make knight at 'a' is the right move, expanding his own moyo and also reduce Black's influence, which is a better strategy.];B[eg];W[gh];B[fh]C[B109 and B111 are good moves!];W[fg]
;B[ff];W[gg];B[df];W[cg];B[fe];W[gd];B[eh];W[fd];B[ce];W[be];B[gi];W[hi];B[hj]
;W[ii];B[de];W[bd];B[ij];W[ji];B[jj]C[Through B131, it becomes a territory race, Black gains a lot, the situation becomes closer.];W[bi];B[bj];W[cm];B[bm];W[rh]LB[og:a][kj:b]C[W136 is the losing move! White should play atari and wrap up at 'a', then play hane at 'b'. This way White can ensure victory.]
;B[ng]C[The diagonal of B137 is good move, White can't form territory in the center, Black starts to become favorable for the game.];W[ki];B[bq]C[B139 is clever move! Black extorts 2 points from White, and these two points are also fatal.];W[bp];B[ar];W[bs];B[ap];W[ao];B[bo];W[aq];B[ed];W[ec]

;B[kr];W[ks];B[or];W[kk]LB[rg:a]C[W178: White should first play atari at 'a', this way White may still have a chance.];B[ds];W[aq];B[sg]C[The counter-sente move of B181 is big!];W[jk];B[il]C[The situation is close, but Black's small advantage already can't be changed.];W[rg];B[se]
