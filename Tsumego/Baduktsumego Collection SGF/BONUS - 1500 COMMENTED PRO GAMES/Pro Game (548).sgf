Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[In the Wangwi final, Lee Sedol conceded defeat with only 84 moves in the game 4, in the game 5, he didn't get any chance either.];W[dd];B[pq];W[oc];B[md]
;W[dp];B[fq];W[hq];B[qo]C[Clearly Lee Changho has already studied the strategy to counter the one-space high pincer.];W[ne]C[Through W10, the position is same as that in the game 2.];B[pe]C[B11: Black starts to vary.];W[me];B[ld];W[le];B[kd];W[nd];B[gc]
;W[id];B[ic];W[hd];B[hc];W[jd];B[jc];W[ke];B[gd];W[lb];B[df];W[ec];B[ff];W[cn]C[However, with the opening up to W30, it should be White's expected result, because Lee Changho already played the variation at the top many times.]
;B[qi];W[kq]C[B31 and W32: Each side plays on their own, next Lee Sedol has no confidence to play a close game, so he starts a fierce fight very earlier on.];B[cq]C[The fight starts with B33 in the lower left corner.];W[dq];B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[eq];B[bo];W[bn];B[co];W[do]
;B[dn]LB[cp:a][em:b]C[B43: For Black to connect at 'a' is common sense, this way White will protect the cut by playing at 'b'.];W[ao];B[cp];W[ap]C[Therefore, Black cuts with B43, then turns to the upper left corner, this is Lee Sedol's fighting strategy.];B[bd]C[The variation is very complicated, but Black's corner already died quickly, Black needs a very big courage to play this way. Lee Sedol has the gut to play any possible move/variation, but it is always fraught with grim possibilities with this kind of play.];W[cc];B[bc];W[ce]LB[bb:a]C[W50: For White to play at 'a' instead is making compromise.]
;B[cb];W[db];B[cd];W[de];B[be]LB[dc:a]C[B55: Black should consider to simply take the ko at 'a'.];W[cf];B[dg];W[ca];B[dc];W[cg]C[After White ataris with W58, White crawls with W60, Black is difficult.];B[ch]
;W[bh];B[ci]LB[bi:a][dh:b][ee:c][bb:d]C[B63: If Black hanes at 'a' instead, after White cuts and ataris at 'b', White's turn at 'c' is sente, then White will atari at 'd', Black is no good.];W[bb];B[cc];W[eb]LB[fb:a][ac:b][bf:c][ab:d][ee:e]C[After the atari of W64, the simple connection of W66 is important, if White hangs at 'a', then Black will simply turn at 'b'. In the game if Black turns at 'b', then White will block at 'c', next B 'd' and W 'e' is still sente, Black is no good.]
;B[ba];W[aa];B[da];W[ea];B[bf];W[bg];B[ac]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.

Black has used 1 hour and 23 minutes, White has used 1 hour and 37 minutes.];W[ee]LB[fe:a][ge:b][ba:c][ed:d][bi:e]C[The simply turn of W74 is a calm and good move! If White attaches at 'a' instead, Black will block at 'b', next after W 'c' and B 'd', Black will turn down at 'e', in the capturing race White is one liberty short.]
;B[ab]LB[ef:a][fr:b][es:c][cl:d][ck:e][dm:f][bl:g]C[The atari of B75 almost equals to admitting defeat, because after White pushes out at 'a', Black already can't deal with it! At any rate, with B75, Black should clamp at 'b', W 'c', Black can play at 'd' or 'e' to seek variations, even if B 'd' and W 'f' or B 'e' and W 'g', Black is no good either, but the variation would be much more complicated.];W[ef]LB[eg:a][fg:b]C[After the push of W76, if Black blocks at 'a', then White will cut at 'b', Black would collapse.];B[je]C[But with the cut of B77, Black already loses common sense! Black incurs loss with this move instead.];W[jf]
;B[cm];W[fg];B[gf];W[bm]C[After W80, B81 and W82 are miai.];B[cl];W[bk];B[bl];W[al];B[ck];W[bj];B[cj];W[en];B[dm]
;W[bi]C[After White crosses over with W92, Black suffers a big defeat.];B[ar];W[ak];B[fr];W[fs];B[aq];W[am];B[bp];W[ig];B[hh];W[fi];B[hg];W[gj]
;B[eo];W[fo];B[em];W[ep];B[fn];W[gn];B[eo];W[ij];B[ih];W[en];B[eh];W[fh];B[eo]
;W[af];B[hk];W[en];B[fm];W[hj];B[go];W[fp];B[hn];W[eg];B[if];W[ie];B[jg];W[ba]

;W[gq];B[or];W[qr];B[pr];W[om];B[ol];W[mm];B[pm];W[ik];B[il];W[hl]C[Although Black continued to play many moves, but in fact, after the push of W76, Black is already in a losing situation. If this were not the decisive game, perhaps Lee Sedol would concede defeat already.];B[gl];W[im]C[Lee Changho successfully defended his title.]
