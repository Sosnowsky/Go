(;SZ[19]EV[Japan 2nd Meijin Title final match 7]DT[1963-09-29]PB[Fujisawa Hideyuki]BR[Meijin]PW[Sakata Eio]WR[Honinbo]KM[5.5]RE[W+R]C[W120 is Sakata's famous move in this game.

In 2000, Sakata Eio celebrated his 80 year's birthday and officially announced his retirement. In the press conference, he concluded his 65 year's Go career. The game that gives him the most impression is the game 7 in the 2nd Meijin (old) Title held in Sept. 1963. In the opening, Sakata was falling way behind, in the middle game, players in the study room found W120 - an excellent tesuji, later on Sakata did use this move to turn the game around, obtaining both Meijin and Honinbo titles (there was no Kisei at that time). This move was considered as "an ingenuous move beyond the highest heavens" (Go Seigen's words) and is hard to forget even till today.
