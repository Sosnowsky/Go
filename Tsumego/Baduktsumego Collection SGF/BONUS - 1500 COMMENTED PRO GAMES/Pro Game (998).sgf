Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[Comparing with women tournament's calmness, in this term, the format was changed to China, Japan and Korea three countries' ring contest, this unique format draws an overwhelming attention. This is the game between Ye Gui 5p and Suzuki Ayumi 3p of Japan.];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[fc]
;W[hc];B[nc];W[cf];B[qo]C[Through B9, Black gets to protect two corners and can be satisfied.];W[kq];B[fq];W[eq];B[fp];W[dn];B[iq];W[nq];B[mp]C[B17 is a common tactic locally.]
;W[pr]C[The attachment of W18 is good timing.];B[qr];W[pp];B[qq];W[mq];B[kp];W[jq];B[jp];W[np];B[lp];W[ir]C[The sequence up to W28 basically becomes joseki.];B[lq]LB[qi:a][hr:b][jr:c][ip:d][or:e]C[With the sequence following B29, Black elects to build outside influence, but White is left with the excellent splitting point at 'a', Black's play is worth study. With B29 Black can consider to double hane at 'b', next W 'c', B 'd' and W 'e', this set pattern is relatively more balanced.]
;W[lr];B[no];W[kr];B[oo];W[qi];B[qg];W[ql];B[oj]LB[pk:a]C[Black's attacking with B37 is interesting, the common attacking point is at 'a'.];W[qn]C[White tries to dodge herself with W38, it is good feeling.];B[rj]LB[ro:a]C[The original move of B39 is to descend at 'a', however Black feels a little inconvenient, in the real game, Black simply takes tenuki, this is also playable.]
;W[po];B[op];W[qp];B[rp];W[ro];B[pn];W[qo];B[pm];W[pl];B[ol]LB[qj:a]C[B49: Black can also consider to push and capture one stone at 'a', this is relatively more substantial.];W[qj];B[ri]
;W[om]LB[ok:a][nk:b]C[The cut of W52 is a good asking move. if White wedges at 'a', then Black will atari at 'b', sacrificing two stones, Black is favorable.];B[nm];W[ok];B[on];W[rk];B[nk];W[rh]C[Through W58, White obtains a considerable territory, although Black's outside is also very thick, but it seems Black is hard to control.];B[jc]LB[dc:a][cc:b][ed:c][db:d][eb:e]C[B59 is a questionable move. Black should attach at 'a', next W 'b', B 'c', W 'd' and B 'e', making a ko, this way the situation will be still chaotic.]
;W[he]C[The shape with the jump of W60 is very good, Black's thickness in the center can't be fully utilized.];B[fe];W[je];B[db];W[cc];B[fg];W[hg]C[With the jump of W66, White takes the chance to enter into Black's center, Black's problem of inadequacy in territory now becomes very practical.];B[dh];W[cb];B[gi];W[hi];B[hj]
;W[ii];B[ij];W[gj];B[fi];W[jj];B[ji]C[The cut of B77 is a must, only playing this way Black may have a chance of winning.];W[gk];B[ik];W[jh];B[ki];W[kh];B[lh]LB[cl:a]C[The hane of B83 is the last losing move. Here is not very urgent. Black should force at 'a', this way Black still can fight for a victory.]
;W[li];B[kj];W[lg];B[mh];W[dk]C[W88 is an excellent point! Black sinks into the situation where she has to make life, Black is in a big losing situation.];B[de];W[ed];B[fd];W[ee];B[ef];W[gf];B[ff];W[gb]
;B[ce];W[df];B[be];W[bf];B[bg];W[ae];B[dg];W[bd];B[ck];W[cj];B[dj];W[ej];B[di]
;W[cl];B[bk];W[dl];B[bj];W[or];B[qm];W[rm];B[so];W[rn];B[sq];W[hq];B[ip];W[hp]
;B[cq]C[The order of B121 and B123 is also wrong, it seems Black already has lost her fighting spirit.];W[cp];B[ho];W[go];B[gn];W[hn];B[io];W[fo];B[fn];W[eo];B[hl];W[mg];B[nh]
;W[lc];B[me];W[le];B[kg];W[jg]C[Through W140, Black finally concedes defeat. Yu Gui won the fifth game in a row. The game 8 will take place on 12/22.])
