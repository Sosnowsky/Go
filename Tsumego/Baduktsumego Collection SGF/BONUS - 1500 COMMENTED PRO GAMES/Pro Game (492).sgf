;W[mq]C[W6 is the most recent play to counter "Chinese Opening". If Black protects the corner at 'a', White will happily make extension back at 'b'.]LB[po:a][jq:b];B[np]C[Through B7, the game becomes a territory-race.];W[mp];B[mo];W[nq];B[op];W[lo];B[mn];W[pr];B[qr]
;W[ln];B[mm];W[or];B[qp];W[ip]C[Through W20, locally the exchange is about even.];B[cn];W[cp];B[ck];W[ci]LB[dn:a]C[W24 seems inevitable, but the result is not necessarily good. With W24 White can consider to attach at 'a', first enclosing a big territory.];B[gq]LB[en:a]C[B25: For Black to first jump at 'a' and exchange one move at the bottom then protect the upper-right corner is also not bad. In the game, invading directly is clearly Hu Yaoyu's study result, surprisingly White has no good way to handle this appear-unreasonable invasion.]
;W[fp];B[er];W[dm]LB[cr:a][iq:b][ir:c]C[W28: If White jumps to 'a', after B 'b', Black can easily makes life by standing at 'c'. Since there is no good answer, White first starts to attack the left side.];B[ek];W[cm];B[iq];W[jq];B[hq];W[jr];B[cr]C[But after Black grabs the sente move of B35, Black turns around and jumps into the corner, obtaining points and also making life locally, Black is successful in the fight.]
;W[ei]LB[fc:a]C[W36: White wants to redeem his loss at the bottom by attacking, but it is hasty, to protect the corner at 'a' is the original move, this way White's situation is a little inferior but the game would still last long.];B[cc]C[B37 entering the corer is huge! The difference in territory has been enlarged further.];W[cd];B[dc];W[ed];B[fb];W[kl]LB[gj:a]C[W42 is an overplay! White can only capture two black stones by playing at 'a'.];B[em];W[dn]
;B[go];W[ho];B[gj];W[gh];B[qf]C[After Black makes the knight's move of B47, with B49 Black unexpectedly can take tenuki again.];W[gp]C[W50: White has no other choice but to kill big dragon strongly, otherwise White's territory is definitely inadequate.];B[ik]C[B51 is a good move.];W[jj];B[ij];W[ji]C[White has no alternative but to answer with W52 and W54.];B[hh]C[Black follows the tempo and attaches out with B55, again taking a lot of advantage on the outside.]

;W[bh];B[hm]C[Then, Black turns back and makes the knight's move of B83, locally Black already has a living shape.];W[hl]C[W84: White makes the last-ditch effort!];B[gl];W[il];B[cj];W[dl];B[jl]LB[hk:a]C[B89 is a bad move, if Black simply blocks at 'a', Black would be already alive.];W[im];B[ej];W[dh]
;B[in];W[jm];B[hk];W[jk];B[el]LB[fk:a][fq:b][gm:c][fi:d][fl:e]C[After tightening himself one liberty, B97 is a big mistake! Now Black can only make eye at 'a', when W 'b', Black can sacrifice the lower group and make life the big dragon. Otherwise White has the good atari at 'c', next B 'd' and W 'e', Black's big dragon becomes ko-alive, but since Black's liberty is tight, so Black is not good even with many local ko threats.  Here the variation is complicated, however if you calculate carefully, you can see, even if Black sacrifices the lower group, the game is still to Black's advantage.];W[fi]LB[gm:a][fk:b][fm:c][aj:d][gk:e][fj:f]C[But after B97, White doesn't grab the chance. Now with W98 if White plays atari at 'a', Black can only make eye and ko-live by playing at 'b', this way Black will collapse with the same reason as we described. If Black plays atari at 'c', then W 'b', B 'd', W 'e', Black takes and White can go home at 'f'. Black will die unconditionally. This is also the bad result of B89 tightening his own liberty. Originally with B89 Black blocks at 95, White can only answer at 90. Since this is a fast game, White delivers the last losing move of W98 under the time pressure.]
;B[aj]C[After Black makes life easily with B99, White suffers a big defeat.];W[bl];B[bk];W[ah];B[ai];W[hn];B[gm];W[le];B[mk];W[mi];B[nh];W[pb];B[bd]
