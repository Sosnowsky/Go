Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[pd]C[In the game 1 of the 30th Gosei title match, the defending champion Yoda Norimoto 9p took Black and defeated the challenger Yuki Satoshi 9p.];W[dc];B[dq];W[pp];B[ce]
;W[di];B[dh]C[The attachment of B7 was once used by Lee Sedol against Yoda Norimoto in this year's Fujitsu Cup, as to this move, Yoda incurred a big loss. Now Yoda uses this move against Yuki, it shows Yoda thinks this move is not bad.];W[eh]LB[ci:a]C[In terms of this game, W8 is not better than the descent at 'a'.];B[ch];W[ei];B[ci]LB[ed:a]C[B11: For Black to play at 'a' is relatively better.];W[cj]LB[de:a]C[W12: White should press at 'a'.];B[bj]
;W[ck];B[bk];W[cl];B[co]LB[gq:a]C[B17 is not good, this move is clearly not big, Black should make extension at 'a'.];W[qi];B[nq];W[pn];B[kq];W[nc];B[qf];W[fd]C[W22 and W24: White forms an ideal shape, White is vivid and takes lead in the opening.]
;B[kc];W[ic];B[nd]LB[jc:a]C[If Black decides to sacrifice with B27 after W26, then with B25 Black should consider to split at 'a'. This way Black can make one-space extension on both sides, it is not difficult to handle. Since White on the left side is thick, for Black to turn around with B27 and sacrifice is understandable.];W[oc];B[pc];W[ld]LB[md:a][ne:b][me:c][mf:d][lf:e]C[But W30 is inexplicable, why not play at 'a', next B 'b', W 'c', B 'd' and W 'e', to capture big? This way White's territory is very big and White can be satisfied. In the real game, White thinks W30 is steady.];B[id]
;W[hc];B[gd]C[But with B31 and B33 Black is insatiable and starts to bully White, White is not happy.];W[df]LB[gc:a]C[W34: White can't hold and retaliate, but this move is too risky and White doesn't have assurance of success at all! White should tolerate by playing at 'a'.];B[fe];W[ed];B[kd];W[od];B[gc]C[Black pushes down with B39, it is severe!];W[hd]C[W40: It is too big to sacrifice two stones, so the following sequence is one-way street.];B[ge]
;W[he];B[hf];W[je];B[if];W[ie];B[de];W[ee];B[ef];W[ff];B[eg];W[fg];B[dg];W[gf]C[W54: White cuts with an inefficient shape, it definitely will not have a good result.]
;B[fh];W[gg];B[fc];W[ec];B[eb];W[db];B[hb];W[fa];B[gb];W[ib];B[hh]LB[oe:a]C[B65 is tight! Although the block at 'a' in the upper right corner is very big, but because White is too heavy on the left side and White can't take tenuki, here Yoda plays well.];W[gh]
;B[fi];W[gi];B[fj];W[fl];B[gl];W[fm];B[gk];W[hi];B[dj];W[fo];B[fq];W[hn];B[oe]
;W[ne];B[md];W[pe]LB[le:a][nf:b][mf:c][mc:d][lc:e][mg:f][lf:g][nh:h]C[W82 is unreasonable! In many cases, you must tolerate. Although it is painful, White still should answer at 'a', next B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f', W 'g' and B 'h', this way although Black takes advantage, but the game is still early.];B[of];W[pb];B[qb]
;W[qe];B[rd];W[re];B[qd];W[mc];B[me];W[nf];B[pf]C[White escapes with W92 and Black connects calmly with B93, White instead makes himself heavy.];W[lc];B[le];W[ke];B[ng];W[mf]
;B[lf];W[mg];B[lg];W[mh];B[lh];W[mi];B[ii]C[After Black presses consecutively following B101, Black tangles with B105 and makes White really painful! Here White basically couldn't take any advantage, White selects a wrong place to fight.];W[ij];B[jj];W[ik];B[jh];W[hg];B[ig]LB[kb:a][lb:b][la:c][ob:d][na:e]C[B111 is unnecessary, if Black descends at 'a', next W 'b' and B 'c', locally it leads to a ko and White is not good. If White connects at 'd', Black can make the large knight's move at 'e', White is also not good.]
;W[ih];B[lb];W[kb];B[hh];W[hj];B[jb];W[ka];B[ja];W[ob]LB[jc:a][la:b][jd:c]TR[kb]C[When B119, W120 perhaps is miscalculation! White can only first play at 'a', followed by B 'b', the marked white, B120 and W 'c', this way although the situation is also not to White's favor, but White still can continue.]
;B[la];W[kb];B[jc]C[Black takes with B121, when W122, Black can connect with B123, White suddenly collapses.];W[mb];B[ia];W[ha];B[ga];W[ea];B[na];W[qa];B[ma];W[rb];B[kf]C[The final game 2 will take place on 7/15.]
