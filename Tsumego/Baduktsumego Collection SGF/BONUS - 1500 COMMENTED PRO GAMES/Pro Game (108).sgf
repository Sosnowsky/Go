;W[cp]C[The first game of the 47th Korean Guksu title match takes place in Yunnan, China on 1/14, the game will continue in the afternoon.];B[ho];W[bc];B[fe];W[gf];B[ge];W[hf];B[gc];W[gb];B[fb];W[eb];B[hb];W[fa]
;B[he]C[In the morning, it is still sunshine, but in the afternoon, suddenly the hailstone comes down, the organizing committee adopts the second plan for the commentary on the big board.];W[if];B[ic]C[At 2:30pm, Jiang Zhujiu 9p, who is responsible for the big board commentary, thinks that so far Black is favorable for the game. Black is very proactive in the fights, from the move #5, Black starts to vary, the play is strikingly new.];W[qj];B[qn];W[pm];B[on];W[gm];B[gn];W[fm];B[fn];W[hm]
;B[em];W[fk];B[el];W[qf]C[Jiang Zhujiu 9p: Choi Cheolhan's timing of fight is relatively appropriate, it is a positive confrontation, so far the game is of very high quality.];B[nc];W[rd];B[qc];W[ok];B[of];W[kd];B[je];W[lf]C[Jiang Zhujiu 9p: The game will not finish soon, the game will proceed very slowly.]
;B[jf];W[nd];B[md];W[ne]C[Kim SeungJun 8p: (up to W100) Now the game comes to a very important battle (in the upper right), it seems Black is a little better, after this local exchange ends, the shape for the whole game will be set.];B[pf];W[mc];B[qg];W[oc];B[rh];W[pr];B[or];W[qq];B[qr]
;W[qp];B[pp];W[rr];B[ps];W[rn];B[ro];W[qo];B[rq];W[pn];B[rp];W[qn];B[sr];W[ri]C[In the study room, Jiang Zhujiu, Rui Naiwei and Kim SeungJun think (up to W122): White has taken some advantage in the upper-right exchange, White has more territory, so far the game is to White's favor.]
;B[ol];W[pk];B[nb];W[ob];B[lc];W[mb]C[Qiu Jihong 5p: Originally White is short by one liberty, but the game takes a sudden turn, White's shape settlement in the upper right is unexpected, in the study room nobody has conceived this variation, this set pattern seems to be the best for White, this exchange also becomes the exchange of the whole game situation.];B[lb];W[na];B[qb];W[ld];B[kc];W[jg]C[Rui Naiwei: If Lee Changho doesn't have any clever endgame to redeem the difference, the difference will become bigger and bigger, the game will end earlier than expected.]
;B[ph]C[Qiu Jihong and Rui Naiwei: With B135, Black starts to fight desperately, it is surprising that Black is not giving a thought on his big dragon at the top, if White strikes first at the top, Black will be exploited miserably, however White simply answers with W136, so it shows that White is very careful in this favorable situation.];W[pi]LB[gd:a]C[Rui Naiwei: W136 is of a favorable consciousness but looks conservative, if White elects to attack Black at 'a', Black would be very difficult, after White's slow move of W136, the game becomes very close.];B[fd];W[oh];B[qh];W[dk]C[(5:55pm) After top pros in the study room calculate points, the situation is very close, guessing the game can't finish before 6:30pm.];B[ek];W[do];B[cn];W[hn];B[en]

;B[kg];W[jh];B[hj];W[gj];B[jj];W[kf]C[(6:30pm) Qiu Jihong 5p thinks: White's advantage is very limited, the game is very close, now the game enters into what Lee Changho is good at --- the endgame, Choi Cheolhan is already in overtime, the outcome of the game is still hard to judge. Choi Cheolhan doesn't elect to attack at the top and has missed a precious opportunity.];B[qi];W[rj];B[gi];W[fj];B[nf];W[eo];B[jn]

;B[fq];W[fr];B[lj];W[mk];B[eq];W[er];B[kj];W[nl]C[It is very obvious that White has no choice but to play W192, White's two dragons, one at the top and one at the bottom, are not completely alive yet, this is White's hidden trouble.];B[fh]C[Qiu Jihong 5p: The diagonal's extension of B193 is a clever move, which has established a good foundation to capture the five stones in the center (which leads to Black's victory in the postgame analysis). This move is described by Rui Naiwei as "accurate and relentless".];W[mh]C[W194: White also has no alternative but to play W194, it is very obvious, White at the top comes under a severe attack.];B[fp];W[dp]
;B[bq]C[The atari of B197 wins time for the severe tactic of B199, Lee Changho makes his final decision.];W[cq];B[ig]C[B199 is very severe, separating White and establishing his superiority.];W[jd];B[ie];W[ih];B[ed]C[With the connection of B203 in sente, Black has taken some advantage, the ensuing sequence is natural.];W[cb];B[hg];W[hh];B[gg];W[cd]
;B[bm];W[bl]C[Through W210, Black is leading about 7 or 8 points on the board, therefore Black is already favorable for the game, by Lee Changho's endgame skill, it can be considered that the outcome of the game has been already decided.];B[mq];W[eh];B[eg];W[mp];B[np];W[mr];B[nq];W[lr];B[ai];W[jc];B[jb]
