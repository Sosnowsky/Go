;B[fo];W[fq]C[The opening from B1 to W8 is same as the final game of Lebaishi Cup between me and Hu Yaoyu.];B[ho];W[dj]LB[hq:a]C[W10: If White jumps to 'a', Black will pincer at 10 to attack W6, this will become another game.];B[iq];W[nq]LB[op:a][mq:b][pn:c][oq:d][np:e][pq:f][jd:g]C[W12 is questionable move, White should approach high at 'a', if B 'b', then W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f' and W 'g', this way White is not bad.]
;B[pq];W[kq];B[mp];W[mq];B[kp]C[White overlooks the strong moves of B15 and B17.];W[lp];B[lo];W[lq];B[ko];W[mo];B[no]C[B23 is also strong move, White can't stick head out smoothly.];W[np]
;B[mn];W[oo];B[nn];W[pp];B[qo]C[In order to reinforce the cut in sente, White is forced to make exchange of W28 and B29.];W[on];B[om];W[pm];B[pl]C[Even like this, White is still being attacked fiercely by B31 and B33, White is difficult.]
(;W[jp]LB[jq:a]C[W34 is mistake! After being cut by B 'a', White at bottom already can't make life! White should play as the variation a.];B[jq];W[qq];B[qr];W[rq];B[oq];W[op];B[rr];W[qn]LB[ol:a][nm:b][ql:c][pn:d]C[Due to the exchange of W34 and B35, now if White plays atari at 'a', then B 'b', W 'c' and B 'd', White at bottom will be killed.]

(;B[qm]LB[ql:a]C[B43: Black misses a good chance! If Black descends at 'a', White still needs a lot of effort to live, White may only play as the variation a, Black is clearly favorable.];W[pn];B[ol];W[rn];B[rp];W[ql];B[qk];W[rl]C[In the game, White captures one stone and finally makes life.];B[jd]LB[ln:a]C[B51: Black takes tenuki to grab the big point and already prepares for the exchange from W 'a' to W62.]
;W[ln];B[lm];W[kn];B[jo];W[pk];B[pj];W[ok];B[nk];W[nm];B[oj];W[mm];B[jn];W[pc]C[The attachment of W64 is the biggest point on the board.]

;B[bi]C[B89: Black initiates a ko fight tenaciously.];W[ci];B[ep];W[ei]LB[eq:a]C[W92 is again a mistake, White should play ko threat at 'a'. It is not only big point and also related to the thinness/thickness of both sides, plus White is not fearful of this ko fight.];B[cj];W[nr];B[pr];W[ci];B[kc];W[ld];B[cj]
;W[en]LB[eq:a]C[W100: White still should connect at 'a'.];B[bo];W[ci];B[ap];W[dh]C[Through W104, it forms an exchange, Black is clearly favorable.];B[gc];W[fb];B[nf]LB[gb:a]C[B107: For Black to block at 'a' is simple.];W[gb]

;W[gn]LB[fd:a][jr:b]C[W134 is almost "blind" ko threat! Now White can only connect at 'a' or play ko threat at 'b'.];B[fd]C[After Black takes with B135, Black seems to win the game.];W[go];B[gp];W[fp];B[ed];W[dc];B[de];W[ee];B[ef]

;B[gg];W[hf];B[hg];W[df];B[ih];W[eg];B[ki]LB[ie:a]C[B173 is unnecessary, if Black connects at 'a', White is really difficult to turn the game around.];W[ie];B[he];W[ke];B[jh];W[kb]C[W178: White is very happy to play atari in sente.]
;B[ja];W[mj];B[lj];W[kh];B[gj]LB[lh:a]C[B183 is again unnecessary, only if Black blocks at 'a', Black is leading about 10 points on the board.];W[li];B[kj];W[mk];B[jm];W[ij]C[W188 is game-deciding move.];B[jk]LB[hk:a][jl:b]C[The diagonal of B189 is losing move!
