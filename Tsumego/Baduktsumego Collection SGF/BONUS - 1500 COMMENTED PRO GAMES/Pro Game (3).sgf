(;B[cn]LB[db:a][cc:b][hd:c][fq:d][ng:e]C[B13 starts to vary, in the last game, Lee Sedol played the knight's move at 'a', followed by W 'b', B 'c', W 'd' and B 'e' (see var a).];W[cl]C[In the game 3 of this LG Cup final, Lee Sedol taking Black won the game by resignation, Lee Sedol played very gracefully in the game, in contrast, Lee Changho made several obvious mistakes, the "Stone Buddha" often loses his common senses in the face of the "Invincible Youth", this is a strange phenomenon which puzzles the Go arena.];B[fp];W[dn];B[dm];W[cm];B[dq];W[co]
;B[cq];W[en]LB[fq:a][eq:b][gq:c]C[W22 is a solid move, White also aims at the weakness at 'a', if W 'a', B 'b' and W 'c'.];B[iq]C[B23: Black elects to reinforce, Lee Changho also plays very steadily.];W[hc]C[Because Lee Sedol leads 2:1 in best-of-5 series, so Lee Changho must win this game and force the game 5, otherwise Lee Sedol will win his second world champion. In 2002, Lee Sedol won 15th Fujitsu Cup champion by beating Yoo Changhyeok.];B[cc];W[dc];B[db];W[eb];B[cb]
;W[ec];B[be];W[bf];B[ce];W[de];B[cd]C[So far, Black has taken all four corners, as the Go proverb says, it is hard to play if all four corners are occupied by your opponent, let's see what kind of good maneuver Lee Sedol can adopt.];W[fd]C[W36 is the simplest play, the tempo seems a little slow, but White becomes very thick.];B[nc]C[Through 37, it seems Black is relatively easier to play.];W[in]LB[hi:a][fi:b][ji:c]C[W38 is the vital point for both sides' territorial framework, Black now needs to reduce White's center, in the study room, pros think Lee Changho could play at 'a', next Black must choose either 'b' or 'c'.]
;B[gi]C[B39: Black plays one more line deeper, Go is also called "hand talk", here Black is saying, if you are skillful, come and kill me!];W[ii]LB[ei:a]C[W40 at 'a' is obviously out of the question.];B[gf]LB[df:a][gd:b]C[B41: Black aims to cut at 'a' and hane at 'b'.];W[if];B[gd]C[In their first 3 games, the players who won are all taking Black.];W[gc]LB[df:a]C[Black is pondering, because Black has the cut at 'a', so it is not difficult for Black to manage.]
;B[ei];W[eg]C[W46: White protects the cut. Now White must go all out to attack Black, otherwise the territory will be the biggest problem for White.];B[fg];W[fh]LB[eh:a][gg:b][ff:c][gh:d][dg:e][df:f][ef:g][hf:h]TR[ei]C[W48 is a severe attack. If Black cuts at 'a', then W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 'e', W 'f', B 'g' and W 'h', the fight is not favorable to Black (see var a). W48 is apparently to Lee Changho's surprise, Lee Changho is in a deep meditation. The pros in the study room think, B45 (the marked stone) should directly cut at 'f'. Lee Changho has been thinking for 30 minutes, now he has used 50 minutes more than Lee Sedol.]

(;B[eh]LB[gh:a][fi:b][hg:c][gg:d][fe:e]C[B49: After thinking for 35 minutes, Lee Changho elects to cut, if Black blocks at 'a', then W 49, B 'b', W 'c', B 'd' and W 'e', White would have fixed his weakness and Black is still under severe attack, Black can not be satisfied (see var b).];W[gg];B[ff];W[gh];B[df]LB[dg:a][ef:b][ch:c][ci:d][bi:e][bj:f][bh:g]C[After Black cuts with B53, if W 'a', B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f' and W 'g', Black is still not that easy to handle.]

(;W[bi]C[Lee Sedol just drinks a cup of green tea, he looks very relaxed.];B[bj]LB[bh:a][dh:b][cg:c][dj:d][ck:e][cj:f][hf:g][fi:h]C[After B59, if W 'a', B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f' and W 'g', Black still need to strengthen at B 'h', then Black would have completely failed in the fight (see var a).]

;B[bn]C[Through 71, it leads to an exchange, this exchange is clearly favorable for White.];W[el]C[Pros in the study room think unanimously that Lee Changho has suffered a heavy loss in this battle.];B[kp]C[B73: Black grabs some territory, aiming to prolong the war in order to find the winning chance.];W[em];B[dk];W[bo];B[bl]C[Lee Sedol is very cautious and still doesn't strike out with his next move.
];W[on]LB[op:a][qp:b][qq:c][ln:d]C[After the cap move of W78, if Black plays at 'a' in reply, then W 'b', B 'c' and W 'd', this is White's ideal plan (see var a).]

(;B[po]C[B79: Black is patient, if Black's lower right corner gets ruined, the game would be over. In the fight of the left side, we are very pleased to enjoy an intense offense-vs-defense fight, as a result, Lee Sedol is beneficial, next let's see how Lee Changho can retrieve his loss under the unfavorable situation. After this move, it is time for noon break, to be continued at 13:00. Lee Changho has used 1 hour and 53 minutes and Lee Sedol 1 hour and 7 minutes.];W[mq];B[je];W[oq];B[op];W[np];B[or];W[nr];B[nq]C[Through 87, a ko fight results, this ko is light for White and heavy for Black, Black is painful.];W[cj];B[aj];W[oq]
;B[no]LB[oo:a][nq:b][ek:c][mp:d][bk:e]C[B91: Black makes this ko even bigger, if W 'a', B 'b', W 'c', B 'd' and W 'e', this may lead to a pleasing exchange for Black (see var a).]

If White in the lower side will die unconditionally, then this exchange will be advantageous for Black.];W[kq];B[kr]LB[jr:a][lr:b]C[B113 is a brilliant move, White can no longer live on the spot, if W 'a', then B 'b', in this area, Lee Sedol 3p perhaps has miscalculated.]

(;W[kd]LB[lo:a][ln:b][kn:c][mo:d][lm:e][mn:f]C[W114: If White makes the diagonal's move at 'a', then B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e' and B 'f' (see var a), W114 is a special play in the unfavorable situation.];B[jd];W[oc];B[nd];W[qc];B[pc];W[pd]
;B[pb];W[qe];B[rd];W[pe]C[Lee Sedol suddenly stands up from his seat, the board and stones are all shaking.];B[re];W[ob];B[qb];W[od];B[nf];W[of]C[Although White has wrecked Black's territory, but Black has also entered into the center, White has suffered a big loss on the lower side.];B[ng];W[pf]

;B[br];W[eq];B[er]C[Now let's look back at the situation, after the game resumed in the afternoon, White's territory becomes less and less, Lee Sedol is probably very regretful too at this moment, in the fight of the lower side, he seems to have suddenly short-circuited.];W[ep];B[fq]LB[fr:a]C[B149: Black should solidly capture one white stone at 'a'];W[fr];B[dr]LB[jr:a][lr:b][hs:c][hq:d][lo:e][ln:f][ko:g][kn:h][jo:i][jn:j][is:k][ks:l][lp:m][ip:n][lq:o][gs:p][fs:q][es:r]C[B151: After B151, if W 'a', B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f', W 'g', B 'h', W 'i', B 'j', W 'k', B 'l', W 'm', B 'n', W 'o', B 'p', W 'q', B 'r' and W 'p', there will be a loophole in Black's territory (see var a), so Black should stand at 'r'.]
