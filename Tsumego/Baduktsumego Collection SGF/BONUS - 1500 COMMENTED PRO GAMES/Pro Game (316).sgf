Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[According to Chang-ki Cup rules, penalty in points will incur if exceeding time, as to Shao Weigang who likes to think for a long time, it is very difficult to control, since you will be threatened by penalties, the tempo of playing is easy to mess up.];W[dc];B[pp];W[dp];B[oc]
;W[ce];B[fq];W[cn];B[jp];W[qn];B[ql];W[nq];B[pn];W[pm];B[qm];W[pq];B[qq];W[kq]C[Zhou Ruiyang must have studied the play of W12 and W18.]
;B[po]LB[jq:a]C[B19: If Black blocks at 'a', White's atari at 19 will be effective, so Black perhaps can only play like this.];W[jq]C[White crawls out with W20, White's tempo is very fast. Although the situation is still about even, it seems White can play.];B[iq]LB[dq:a]C[B21 is an overplay, the common move is to attach at 'a', the result in the game is not to Black's advantage.];W[ir];B[hr];W[hq];B[ip];W[gr];B[hp]
;W[gq];B[kp];W[lq];B[gp];W[mo]LB[mp:a]C[If W32 is omitted, White is worried Black may strike at 'a', for White to stick head out here is very valuable, preventing Black's thickness from connecting together.];B[fr];W[hs];B[cq];W[dq];B[dr];W[cp];B[br]
;W[bq];B[cr];W[dj]LB[ck:a][fp:b]C[W42 is a good move, if White makes two-space extension at 'a', later on White's cut at 'b' is not that powerful anymore.];B[ic];W[gc];B[ie];W[ph]C[W46 is slow!];B[qf]C[B47: Black is very happy!];W[mh]C[After W48, White itself is still not stable.]
;B[be]C[B49: Black aims to destroy White's territory at maximum limit.];W[cf]LB[bd:a]C[W50 is very powerful at the situation where Black is thick, but now with W50 White only needs to hane at 'a', Black can't take any advantage.];B[cd];W[dd];B[bf];W[bd];B[cg];W[ci];B[eg];W[cc];B[ei]
;W[ej];B[fi];W[gk];B[ii]C[From B59 to B63, Black destroys White's territory and also aims to attack White's two stones on the right side, one stone for two birds, Black is successful.];W[pj]C[W64: To settle down is imperative.];B[og];W[ni];B[mf]C[But with B65 and B67 Black is very happy, so with W64 White can consider to play strong moves such as at 67.];W[qr]C[W68 is tesuji, leaving a lot of aji.];B[pr];W[oq]
;B[rr];W[fp]C[The cut of W72 seems to be a dame, but if not making some troubles, Black's territory at the top is too big, White is not good.];B[ok];W[kh];B[ik];W[jd];B[id];W[jj];B[ij];W[kf]C[White destroys territory desperately with W76 and W80, it is unusual tactic.

After this move, it is time for lunch break.];B[fs];W[gs]
;B[ep]C[Following B83, Black makes White very thick, it is damaging.];W[fo];B[eo];W[fn];B[eq];W[en];B[do]LB[co:a]C[B89 also should be reserved, this way W 'a' is gote.];W[dn];B[im];W[co];B[lg]C[Since W92 is sente and Black can't tolerate, so Black releases the game-deciding move of B93, next it leads to a chaotic fight, but White is better at fighting.]

;W[ml];B[ll];W[nk]LB[gd:a]C[W122 is a big questionable move! It is almost the losing move. White certainly should force Black to live at 'a', this way it makes a huge difference in thickness and points!];B[gd]C[Following B123, Black exploits White very happily.];W[je];B[fc];W[fd];B[ed];W[jc];B[fe];W[dg]
;B[dh];W[bg];B[df];W[bh];B[kb];W[le];B[jb];W[lc];B[md];W[ld];B[oj];W[nj];B[pk]
;W[nm];B[qj];W[oh];B[bp]C[Then Black comes back and strengthens to make life with B147, the situation has been turned around.];W[qg];B[bo];W[bn];B[or]LB[on:a][eb:b]C[But next B151 is a very bad move! Since after B151 W 'a' is still sente, to play counter-sente move at 'b' is much bigger! If Black plays at 'b', Black is very difficult to lose this game.];W[rf];B[re]
;W[pf];B[qe];W[on];B[qs];W[me];B[of];W[pg];B[nd];W[pe]LB[nb:a]C[W162: White should directly make the knight's move at 'a'.];B[pd];W[fb]C[W164: The value of this sente move is very big! White again is favorable for the game.]
;B[gb];W[ec];B[hc];W[nb];B[js];W[ks];B[kr];W[mr]LB[jr:a]C[In the following endgame fight, White is a little loose, for example, with W172 White should first play at 'a'.];B[ms];W[jr];B[hn];W[hm]
;B[gn];W[gm];B[ln];W[lm];B[km];W[in]LB[lo:a]C[W182: White should play at 'a', but since Black already incurs 2-point penalty, White wins the game breathtakingly by 1 point.];B[mn];W[oo];B[jm];W[oa];B[qb];W[lo]
