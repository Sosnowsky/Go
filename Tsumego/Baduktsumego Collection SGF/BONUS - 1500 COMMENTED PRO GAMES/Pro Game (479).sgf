;W[hc];B[oc]C[The opening from B1 to B7 was used recently by Chang Hao, who used this to defeat Choi Cheolhan, now Song TaeKon uses this against Chang Hao, apparently he is well-prepared.];W[qo];B[qm];W[qi];B[np];W[qf]C[The sequence from W8 to W12 is a new trend.];B[cc]LB[fq:a]C[B13: Black can also approach the corner by playing at 'a'.];W[dc];B[cd];W[de]
;B[db];W[eb];B[cb];W[ec];B[cf];W[fq]C[The direction of W22 is correct.];B[bp]
(;W[lq]LB[qq:a][qr:b][pp:c][oq:d][jp:e]C[W24: White can also consider to attach at 'a', next B 'b', W 'c' and B 'd', then White can make an extension at 'e', this way Black can't strengthen completely with just one move (see var a).];B[qp];W[cq];B[cm];W[eg];B[lc];W[ck]C[The sequence following W26 is questionable, it seems W28 and W30 come to nothing in the end.];B[em]
;W[co];B[gp]C[When Black presses White with B33, Black's opening is better.];W[gq]
(;B[kp]LB[ip:a][lo:b][nn:c]C[The should-hit of B35 is feeling but no good, with this move, Black should simply jump to 'a', if White jumps out at 'b', then Black can peep at 35 first then take the chance to jump at 'c', this way Black takes the initiative (see var a), in the game White crawls over and obtains territory, Black instead is left with hidden troubles.];W[lp];B[lo];W[mo];B[ln];W[kq];B[jp];W[jq];B[ip];W[hq]

;B[nn];W[cn];B[dk]LB[bn:a][bo:b][ek:c]C[Black overly seeks steadiness with the sequence following B73, Black should hane at 'a', White can't kill Black but to push at 'b', then Black jumps out at 'c', this is clearly better than the real game.];W[cl];B[gl];W[hl];B[gk];W[hm];B[dj];W[cj]
;B[hk];W[ik];B[ij];W[hj]C[W84 is a strong move, the situation becomes complicated, White takes a better turn.];B[ci];W[hi];B[di];W[fj];B[fk];W[bg]C[W90 is in good order!

After this move, it is time for noon break.];B[bi];W[ce]
;B[be];W[bf];B[bd];W[ek]C[W96 again is a good move!];B[el];W[bm];B[cg];W[jc]C[White turns back to make one-space extension with W100, the situation is not clear.];B[id]LB[fh:a][pc:b]C[B101 is clearly unreasonable, Black should probe White with the knight's move at 'a', White is difficult. In the game, because Black's corner has the defect of W 'b', White can fight adequately.];W[jd]
;B[if];W[je];B[gg]LB[jf:a]C[B105: Black should simply press at 'a'.];W[fh];B[jf];W[ej];B[jk];W[il];B[dl];W[pc];B[od];W[kf]
;B[kg];W[lg];B[lf];W[ke];B[lh]LB[mg:a][jh:b][ob:c][pb:d]C[When Black ataris with B119, White can also extend at 'a', next B 'b', W 'c' and B 'd', White can fight.];W[jg]LB[ch:a]C[White's losing cause is before the atari of W120, White should first wedge at 'a', this way White will be completely thick, the situation would be to White's advantage.];B[mg]
;W[jh];B[ef]C[B123: Black is alert!];W[df];B[dg];W[ff];B[jj];W[kn];B[ko];W[ki];B[lk];W[li];B[mi];W[gj]

;W[ib];B[jb];W[hb];B[kb];W[ie]C[W152: White perhaps should take the ko at 'a'.]LB[lg:a];B[jm]C[White first exploits White's territory with B149 and B151 then turns back to grab B153, now the game is already to Black's advantage.];W[rl]C[Next White tries to catch up tenaciously by fighting a ko, but in the end White didn't get any obvious chance of winning.];B[rm];W[ob];B[nb];W[na]
