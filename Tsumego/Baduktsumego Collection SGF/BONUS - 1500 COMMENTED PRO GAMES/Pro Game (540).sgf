(;W[nq];B[oq];W[qr]LB[qp:a][oo:b][pr:c][rn:d]C[The play of W12 and W14 is relatively seldom seen, the common play is to connect at 'a', if Black plays hane at 14, it would return to the original variation of Black's approach at 11 and White's hane at 14, Black perhaps would extend at 'b', then W 'c', B13 and W 'd' (see var a), White may feels that the atari at 'c' is a little crude so he selects another way, however it seems White is a bit far-fetched.];B[po];W[qn];B[on];W[om];B[pm];W[nn]

;W[li];B[mh];W[mp];B[mo];W[no];B[np];W[mq]LB[lh:a]C[With the sequence from W36 to W40, unexpectedly Lee Changho has miscalculated. After exchanging several moves, if White finds out that he can't continue, then with W36, White should simply press at 'a'.];B[qp];W[rp];B[lo];W[lh]LB[lr:a]C[W44: If White makes the diagonal extension at 'a', locally it would be a ko, but White has no appropriate ko threats.]
;B[km];W[mm];B[kl]C[B45 and B47: Black is very happy.];W[ll];B[lr]C[After strengthening back with B49, Black gains a big profit.];W[mg];B[ng];W[nf];B[mf];W[lg];B[ne];W[of]
;B[oe]C[B55 and B57 are very practical.];W[nk]LB[lf:a][og:b][pf:c]C[White can't play atari at 'a' and must be very painful, because Black can play counter-atari at 'b', White takes and Black can atari at 'c', White obviously can't consider this variation, but if White extends at 'c', Black connects, this way White even can't capture four black stones.

After this move, it is time for noon break.];B[og];W[pk];B[pl]LB[pf:a]C[No matter how you look at it, B61 doesn't look like a good move, it is too heavy! Taking at 'a' is just the original move.];W[ok]LB[nj:a][nh:b]C[However, the connection of W62 is even more inexplicable! This way Black instead takes advantage. White should answer at 'a', it would be impossible for Black to keep both the center four stones and the five stones along the side, if Black still sacrifice the center four stones, White can capture with one move at 'b', White saves one connection of W62, this variation would be much better.]
;B[qk];W[nh];B[qi];W[dq];B[pf];W[qj]C[White captures with the diagonal of W68, Black takes the empty corner, Black is better off in the game.];B[rj];W[pj];B[rh];W[ph];B[pi];W[ni];B[lc]C[The diagonal of B75 is apparently due to favorable consciousness, otherwise strengthening with the small knight's move is just fine.]
;W[ck];B[do];W[fp];B[cq];W[cr];B[fo];W[go];B[dr];W[cp];B[eq];W[bq];B[ep]C[B87: Black doesn't elect to atari at the star point, worrying about White's ko threats in the lower right.];W[fn]
;B[em];W[en];B[dn];W[fm]LB[dm:a]C[Since White already pushes with W90, with W92 White should cut at 'a', this way the variation would be complex.];B[dl];W[fk];B[dk];W[dj];B[ej];W[di];B[ek];W[hp]

;W[bk];B[bl];W[eh];B[gq];W[hq];B[fq];W[gr];B[cc]C[In the game, Black's play is very steady, grabbing the corner with B121, Black is already not easy to lose this game any more.];W[cd];B[dc];W[ec];B[eb];W[fb]

;W[ic]LB[hf:a]C[With the descent of W166, White makes the last-ditch struggle, but it is obviously unreasonable. If White hangs at 'a', Black will play hane at 166, Black is leading about 15 points on the board. In this game Lee Changho very rarely didn't perform to his talent.];B[if];W[hf];B[ig];W[gg];B[gh];W[fg];B[he];W[hd];B[ge];W[jb];B[hb]
