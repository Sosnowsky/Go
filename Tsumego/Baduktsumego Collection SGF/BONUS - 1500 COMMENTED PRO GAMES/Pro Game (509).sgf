Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[pd]C[In this decisive game, Chang Hao played well in the first half of the game, but in the second half he made several mistakes and in the end failed to win the champion regrettably.];W[dp];B[qp];W[dc];B[oq]
;W[qj];B[de];W[ce];B[cf];W[cd];B[cn];W[dk]LB[fq:a][df:b][fc:c][dj:d]C[W12 is a variation, if White answers with the knight's move at 'a', then B 'b', W 'c' and B 'd', this will lead to the opening relatively familiar to Chinese players.];B[fq];W[dn]
;B[cq]LB[dm:a]C[B15: Black wants to hane at 'a', the play in the game is territory-oriented, perhaps this is a special strategy against Lee Sedol.];W[dq];B[cp];W[do];B[co];W[cm];B[bm];W[cl];B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[df]
;B[jc];W[nc];B[qf];W[pb];B[qc];W[hc]C[W28 and W32 are Lee Sedol's style, taking both sides, it is very vicious.];B[md];W[oe];B[mc];W[od];B[pg];W[nf];B[lf]
;W[qb];B[ql];W[jf];B[hd]LB[id:a][ic:b][hb:c]C[The press of B43 is unreasonable, if White hanes at 'a', then B 'b' and W 'c', Black will sink into a bitter battle.];W[gc]C[In the game, White retreats with W44, Black has avoided one crisis.];B[je];W[ke];B[kf];W[jd]
;B[ie];W[kd];B[id];W[kc];B[kb]C[White's tactic following W46 looks severe, but the double hane of B53 is an excellent move, White's strong moves are not successful.];W[le];B[me];W[jb];B[ic];W[lb];B[ib];W[mf];B[jg]
;W[mb];B[ja];W[lc];B[pi]C[Through B65, an exchange results, Black's situation is a little better.];W[pj];B[oj];W[qi]LB[pl:a]C[W68 is a game-deciding move in an inferior situation, the common move is to attach out at 'a'.];B[ok]C[After Black extends with B69, White sinks into a bitter battle.];W[rl];B[qm];W[ph]
;B[oi];W[oh]LB[qh:a]C[The push of W74 perhaps is miscalculation, for White to make life by connecting at 'a' is relatively common.];B[qh];W[rh];B[qg];W[rg];B[rk]LB[og:a]C[B79: Black misses a good chance! Black should simply push at 'a', White can't escape his two stones, this way Black's advantage is obvious.];W[rf];B[og];W[nh]C[After the exchange of B79 and W80, White is able to escape with W82.]
;B[ng];W[mh];B[qe];W[re];B[rj];W[ri];B[mg];W[lg];B[lh];W[kg];B[li];W[rd]C[Through W94, it forms another exchange, White takes a breather, however the situation is still to Black's advantage.];B[jp]LB[kp:a]C[B95 is not simple and clear enough, Black should make the extension at 'a', this way Black is very easy to take control of the situation.]
;W[lq]C[White fights desperately with the invasion of W96! White should thank Black for giving such a good chance.];B[jq];W[pq];B[pr]LB[pp:a][or:b][nq:c]C[B99: Black maintains a strong-killing attitude. If Black blocks at 'a', then W 'b' and B 'c', leaving White a ko-killing. Although Black retreats a little, but in this situation, Chang Hao should be easier to take control.];W[ko];B[jo]LB[jn:a]C[B101 is heavy. If Black wants to kill strongly, Black should jump to 'a'.];W[km];B[jn]
;W[op];B[nq];W[pp];B[qq];W[np];B[or];W[kn]C[Through W110, White gets some eye shape and already is not easy to be killed. However Black still should chase and kill in order to have a chance of winning.
];B[bl];W[bk];B[cj];W[ck];B[eq]C[B115 breaks away from the main battle field, making Black's all stones following B95 inefficient, it is almost a way of conceding defeat.]
;W[qo];B[on];W[nn];B[qd];W[rc];B[mp];W[om];B[pn];W[qr];B[rr];W[rq]C[W124 and W126 are famous tesujis, Lee Sedol didn't miss it.];B[rp];W[ro]

(;B[sq]LB[qs:a][po:b][no:c][mo:d][mq:e][mn:f][lp:g][nm:h][rm:i][qn:j]C[B129: Black should take at 'a', next W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', Black connects, W 'e', B 'f', W 'g', B 'h', W 'i' and B 'j', this way White's big dragon is still not alive, and also Black's territory would be better than the real game, Black still can fight (see var a).];W[po];B[nm];W[mo]
;B[lp];W[kp];B[mq];W[mm];B[nl];W[qn];B[pm];W[rm];B[qk];W[kq]C[Through the connection of W142, White's big dragon is basically alive and also White takes a lot of territory in the meantime, so far it can be said Black's defeat is certain.];B[cg];W[ef];B[bj]
