Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[In the semi final of the 6th Chinese Ahan Tongshan Cup held on 10/17, Zhou Heyang 9p took White and defeated Gu Li 7p by resignation, advancing to the final. There are several big fights in the game and it is fun to watch.];W[dc];B[pq];W[dp];B[ce];W[dh]
;B[nc];W[cd];B[qk]C[As to the pincer of W6, Gu Li elects the simplest tenuki, with the two moves B7 and B9, Black forms a very vivid moyo on the right side.];W[mp];B[po];W[jq];B[cn];W[bo]LB[cj:a][de:b][bn:c]C[When White makes the knight's move of W14, Black faces several choices, simply making the extension at 'a' is relatively steady, next W 'b' and B 'c'.];B[de]
;W[fd];B[cj];W[bh];B[fe]C[Black attaches out with B19, a fierce fight already can't be avoided.];W[cl]LB[gd:a]C[The invasion of W20 is hasty, now White should calmly retreat at 'a', waiting calmly to watch what will happen, because Black's shape is thin and weak, it is hard for Black to pose any threat on White's two stones on the left side.];B[gd]C[The hane of B21 is smooth.];W[fc];B[ge]LB[gf:a]C[But next with B23 Black should hang at 'a', one line difference will have a big impact on the right-side fight.];W[hb]

;W[co];B[dr]C[B39 is sharp.];W[eq];B[iq]LB[fq:a][er:b][fr:c][cr:d][io:e]C[But the attachment of B41 is overly chasing efficiency, Black should simply block at 'a', next W 'b', B 'c', W 'd' and B 'e', this way Black can take initiative in the game.];W[jp];B[ip];W[fq];B[gp]
;W[jr];B[ir];W[eo]C[In the game, the diagonal of W48 is a good move!];B[fn];W[er]C[After White strengthens with W50, thus on the left side Black is left with a fatal hidden trouble.];B[jo];W[ko];B[kn];W[jn];B[io];W[lo];B[jm]
;W[hh];B[jd];W[nr]LB[if:a]C[W30: White can consider first to play at 'a', chasing and attacking Black with several moves, then coming back to reinforce, only if not allowing Black form a big moyo on the right side, White will be favorable in territory.
];B[cq];W[bq];B[ij];W[cm];B[bm];W[di];B[ih]C[The attachment of B67 is strong and unyielding.];W[ig]
;B[hg];W[hf];B[gg];W[gh];B[fg];W[ii];B[jh];W[ji]TR[ig][hf]C[Through W76, although White gets to push out, but White's two marked stones was captured by Black in sente, White's loss is obvious.];B[kh];W[jj];B[il]LB[dn:a][li:b]C[When the situation becomes close again, the diagonal of B79 is the losing move of this game! Now Black worries about White's wedge at 'a' to start a ko fight, but Black is also reluctant to simply give way, so Black wants to first take some advantage. In fact, no matter whether Black simply reinforces at 'a' or encloses at 'b', it is already a very easy game for Black to play!]
;W[ln];B[in];W[mh]C[Of course, Zhou Heyang won't miss such a precious chance. White directly invades into Black's moyo with W82, Gu Li enters into an awkward situation --- difficult to advance or to retreat.];B[mj];W[li];B[ki];W[kj];B[lj]C[Black has no choice but to push and cut with B85 and B87 tenaciously, however Black itself has too many defects.];W[oh];B[jf];W[pj]C[White easily escapes with the knight's move of W90.];B[hj]

;B[gj]C[Black extends with B105, making the last-ditch struggle.];W[bi];B[dm];W[dl];B[nn];W[qf];B[bk];W[dn];B[do];W[if]C[W114 is an excellent ko threat. After Black wins the ko, Black still can't kill White unconditionally.];B[dn];W[jg]

;W[kf];B[eg];W[fi];B[aq];W[ic]C[With W130 and W134, White instead tries to kill Black's dragon, Gu Li is powerless to turn the game around.];B[ed];W[ec];B[id];W[lc];B[gc];W[gb];B[bd];W[bf]
