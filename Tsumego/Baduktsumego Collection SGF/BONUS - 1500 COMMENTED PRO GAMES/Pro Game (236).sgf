Edited and translated by gogameworld.com and weiqi.tom.com.];B[pd]C[March 5th is the most unforgettable day of my career, I won my first world champion, the champion of the 5th Ing Cup, I will take this chance to thank my beloved Go fans and friends, my teacher and my family to support and concern me.];W[dd];B[pq];W[cp];B[eq]
;W[qo];B[pl];W[lp];B[po];W[iq];B[cf];W[dh];B[ef];W[fd];B[dk]LB[cm:a][do:b][dj:c]C[The position of B15 is a little inconsistent with earlier plays, Black can consider to pincer at 'a', next W 'b' and B 'c'.]
;W[cm];B[fh];W[ce];B[bf];W[cj]C[White's play following W20 is to my surprise. Here it shows Korean player's favorite close-encountered-battle style, however Teacher Go Seigen criticizes this kind of play.];B[ck];W[dj];B[ek];W[bk];B[bl];W[bj];B[do];W[fi]
;B[co];W[bm];B[gi];W[fj];B[bo]LB[ge:a][hc:b]C[Although the descent of B33 is very big, but Black should first make the knight's move at 'a', after exchanging with W 'b', Black can then descend at 33.];W[gf];B[ge]C[In the real game, after the knight's move of W34, Black has no good follow-up, then Black crosses out with B35 which is captured in a ladder, it is very damaging.];W[fe];B[ff];W[gg]
;B[gh];W[he];B[eh];W[fk]LB[em:a]C[The press of W42 is over-strong, White should simply jump out at 'a', White's situation is not bad. In the game, it forms a ko fight, White is no good.];B[dm];W[em];B[en];W[dl];B[el];W[dn];B[fm];W[fn]

;W[em];B[ec];W[dc];B[dm];W[qp]LB[gm:a]C[W68: In fact, White can only atari at 'a', which is just the biggest place.];B[cl]LB[gm:a][db:b][de:c][hk:d][eg:e][pp:f]TR[dm]C[B69: Black has missed a good chance, very regrettable. Black should extend at 'a', White can only take the ko, then B 'b', W 'c', B43 (the marked stone), now White already has no proper ko threats, no matter to attach at 'd' or push at 'e', it is a big damaging ko, therefore White perhaps can only make compromise by playing at 69, this way Black in the center will be much thicker, next Black connects at 'f', this variation is much better.]

;B[qm];W[rm];B[rl];W[dl];B[fc];W[gc];B[gb];W[cb];B[hc]LB[eb:a][bc:b][gd:c][bb:d][ib:e]C[The atari of B91 is a crude move, Black should simply connect at 'a'. Because Black has the tactic of extending out the marked black stone by playing at 'b', White needs to strengthen and take at 'c', later on Black is still left with the atari at 'd'. Next Black jumps out at 'c', not only making life completely and also taking advantage in points.]
;W[gd];B[kc];W[qk];B[ql];W[qf];B[qe];W[pf];B[nd];W[pi];B[dm];W[qc]C[W102 entering the corner in sente is very big, now the situation is very close, regarding the ko fight on the left side, Black is a little favorable in ko threats.];B[re];W[oc]

;W[im]LB[jq:a][jo:b]C[W116 and W118 are the losing moves. Black gets to take one stone and attach down at 'a', however White still has no good method to deal with Black's big group in the center, White is clearly damaging. With W116 White should continue taking the ko, or with W118 White extends at 'b'.];B[jo];W[jl];B[in];W[il];B[ji];W[kl];B[qr];W[rr];B[pr];W[rs]
;B[jq];W[mn];B[jh]LB[ih:a][bh:b][ij:c]C[B131: Black should hane at 'a', because Black has one eye by jumping to 'b', Black's big group is basically already safe, comparing with the real game, the push at 'c' is left, Black clearly takes advantage in points with the hane at 'a'.];W[on];B[pn];W[jp];B[kp];W[kq];B[ip];W[jr]
;B[lq]LB[hq:a]C[B139 is a mistake. Black certainly should initiate the ko at 'a', White basically can only elect to exchange and eliminate the ko, this way with B139 Black can play at 'a', this is clearly better than the real game.];W[jp];B[sp];W[ko];B[ro];W[ib];B[lo];W[kp];B[nb];W[ob];B[ma];W[oa]
