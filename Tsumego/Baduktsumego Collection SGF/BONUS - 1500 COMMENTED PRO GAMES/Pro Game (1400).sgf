(;SZ[19]EV[12th LG Cup round 1]DT[2007-06-04]KM[6.5]PC[South Korea]PB[Kong Jie]BR[7p]PW[Park Jungsang]WR[9p]RE[W+R]C[Copyright by gogameworld.com and weiqi.tom.com.];B[pd]C[This is a very slow game. Both sides played very carefully, but in the most crucial close-contact fight, Kong Jie made miscalculation, his big dragon suddenly died and he had to concede the game.];W[dd];B[qp];W[dp];B[op]
;W[jp];B[lq];W[qq];B[pq];W[qj];B[qg];W[qo]C[W8 and W12 are novel moves. Liu Xing 7p thinks, locally White incurs a little loss for sure.];B[rq];W[pm]C[But White can make knight with W14 and settle the shape, White also gains.];B[fc];W[cf];B[db]
;W[cc];B[ic];W[cn];B[oc];W[dj];B[fe];W[qe]C[W24 is an asking move, if playing later on, Black may elect to block corner, but now the risk is that next B25 may help Black's moyo at top. Furthermore, if Black gets to reinforce the corner, W24 will become simply damaging move.];B[pe];W[fg];B[fq];W[eq];B[fp];W[hp]C[W30: White starts to attack Black, the situation becomes complicated.]
;B[hq];W[iq];B[ho];W[io];B[hn];W[gp];B[fo];W[go];B[do];W[co]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.];B[cq];W[cp];B[er]
;W[dr];B[dq];W[cr];B[ep];W[bq];B[fn];W[gn]C[B49: Black wants to block at 50. However, Liu Xing thinks, this way Black will be contained inside and is not good to the fight afterwards.];B[gm];W[hm];B[dn];W[dm];B[em];W[gl]
;B[dl];W[cm];B[fl];W[fm]C[W60: White has killing intention. However in this wide area, it is very difficult to kill.];B[gk]C[But in the real game, Kong Jie helps his opponent kill his own dragon.

;W[gf];B[hg];W[ih];B[hf];W[kh];B[hr];W[is];B[dg];W[df];B[he];W[kj];B[dh];W[ee]C[Since White gets one more liberty, White can first make one eye with W94, a capturing race is impossible, this is the fatal reason.]
;B[cl];W[bj];B[bm]LB[bs:a]C[Of course, the most critical is when Kong Jie plays B97, he didn't notice White has good move of hanging simply at 'a', he can only watch his dragon die miserably.];W[bh];B[eq];W[bs];B[gi];W[hi];B[jg];W[ji];B[ig];W[jk]
