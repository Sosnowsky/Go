Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[pd]C[Before this match, O Rissei lost six consecutive games against Lee Changho.];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[fq]
;W[hp];B[go]C[The small knight's move of B7 is a weird move, O Rissei must have prepared this move carefully just against Lee Changho.];W[cn];B[ho];W[ip];B[dm]LB[gp:a]C[B11 is a highly efficient move to strengthen the cut. The original move is to turn at 'a', but it seems too heavy.];W[cm];B[dl];W[dq]LB[io:a]C[W14 is a careless move, the value of spending one move to reinforce the corner is very big, but its timing is too early. With W14 White should turn at 'a', taking care of his lonely stones, now White shouldn't worry that Black may enter the corner at 3-3.]
;B[kp]C[B15 is a strong move.];W[jo]LB[io:a][in:b][jn:c]C[W16: White seems to have no other good choice. The original shape of W16 is to turn at 'a', however, Black's hane at 'b' is severe, next W 'c' and B16, White has no assurance of success in this direct confrontation.];B[hl]C[The jump of B17 to reinforce is highly efficient, so far, we can say Black's new moves are relatively successful.];W[lp]LB[ko:a]C[W18 is a good move in terms of dodging oneself, however Black's several stones on the left are not that thick, with W18 for White to press at 'a' is better.];B[ko]C[Black's selection following B19 is very right, capturing three stones and making himself thick, it is very important. Black scores in this exchange.];W[kq];B[lq]
;W[mq];B[lr];W[mr];B[lo];W[mp];B[jq];W[kr];B[jr];W[ls];B[jp];W[po];B[qo];W[qn]
;B[qp];W[or];B[pn]LB[rn:a]C[The cut of B37 is tasteless, Black should hane at 'a'.];W[qm];B[on];W[qj];B[cf];W[ef];B[fc];W[cc];B[ic];W[gd]LB[qg:a]C[W46 is a crude move, its purpose is to grab the big point at 'a'.]
;B[gc];W[nn];B[oo];W[qg]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.];B[ci];W[op];B[pp];W[ol];B[nc];W[io]C[W56 is a strong and surprising move. Only if White can find a loophole here, White can turn the game around. Lee Changho's fighting ability is indeed uncommon.];B[km];W[hr]
;B[gr];W[gq];B[gp];W[hq];B[fp];W[js];B[nm];W[er]C[Through W66, White's several stones have escaped, the situation has been turned around.];B[hd];W[ce];B[df];W[ee];B[pf]
;W[pg];B[qf];W[og];B[db]LB[of:a]C[B75: Black should continue to attach at 'a', ensuring the corner territory.];W[eh];B[be];W[bd];B[cl];W[pc]C[W80 again is a good move to get the corner.];B[oc];W[qd]
;B[oe];W[re];B[rf];W[pb];B[rc];W[rb];B[rd];W[qc];B[qe];W[sc];B[se];W[qa]C[Through W94, White lives one group successfully, White is leading in territory, everybody thinks Lee Changho will win this game.];B[fr]
;W[im];B[il];W[jm]C[W96 and W98: This exchange with Black should be reserved.];B[jl];W[is];B[bf];W[hf];B[nl];W[nk];B[mk];W[ok];B[mj];W[eb]
;B[ec];W[dc];B[cb];W[bb];B[fb];W[ca];B[ea];W[jf];B[gh];W[ch];B[bh];W[di];B[cj]
;W[he];B[fg];W[eg];B[co]C[B125 is a clever move!];W[bo];B[ge];W[gf];B[fd];W[ff];B[cr];W[dr];B[bn]C[B133 again is a good tesuji. Here White has been severely exploited, the situation is already very close.]
;W[do];B[bm];W[cp];B[rh];W[rg];B[sg];W[ri];B[pr];W[ps];B[oq];W[nq];B[qh];W[ph]LB[si:a]C[The block of W146 is impulsive, and it is also the losing move of this game. White should descend at 'a' to avoid being exploited, this way the game is still very close.]
;B[qs];W[os];B[si]C[Black strikes again with B149, here White has no way to retreat.];W[sj];B[qi];W[sh];B[pi];W[sf];B[pj];W[pk];B[sg];W[oi];B[si]
;W[rj];B[sh];W[mg]C[In the set pattern up to W162, Black again obtains a lot of points.];B[rr];W[hi];B[ji];W[gj];B[ke]C[Black encloses territory with B167, Black is in a sure-winning situation.];W[ma];B[mb];W[ro];B[rp]
;W[ob];B[nb];W[li];B[jh];W[mi];B[de];W[ed];B[hh];W[dj]LB[ih:a]C[The press of W180 is White's privilege, after this move, White's wedge at 'a' will work.];B[dn];W[ih];B[ao]
;W[ap];B[co];W[an];B[ii]C[However, after Black sacrifices with B187, Black is still in a sure-winning situation.];W[ck]C[W188 is a brilliant endgame.];B[dk]C[B189: Black has no other choice, White gets to take 2-point advantage.];W[bi];B[bj];W[bg];B[ai];W[ig];B[fj]
;W[fi];B[gi];W[cg];B[ns];W[nr];B[ej]LB[ag:a]C[B201 is unnecessary. Black can easily win the game by crossing over at 'a'.];W[hj];B[ij];W[ag]C[In the exchange up to W204, Black incurs a small loss.];B[rn];W[rm]
;B[so];W[fm]C[White strikes again with W208, making Black confused.];B[ei]LB[gl:a]C[The counterattack of B209 is unnecessary, Black should double up at 'a', it is a safe play.];W[gn];B[dh];W[en];B[dg];W[fh];B[gk];W[ae];B[ah]
;W[ad];B[af]C[Through B219, again it leads to an exchange, Black incurs loss again. However, luckily Black still wins the game by half point.];W[le];B[ld];W[na];B[la];W[oa];B[lc];W[je];B[rl];W[ql];B[sm];W[kb]
