;W[od]LB[ce:a]C[W6: Yu Bin (White) is well prepared, if White attaches at 'a', then Black will play the large avalanche joseki.];B[fd];W[qc]C[B7 and W8 are tit-for-tat plays, both sides act on their own.];B[kd]C[B9: Black continues to carry out his plan, not allowing White to answer any move easily.];W[rd];B[qe];W[re];B[pc];W[qb]C[The descent of W14 is the exact move that was first played by Cho Chikun 9p seven years ago.];B[pd]
;W[qf];B[pf];W[qg];B[oe];W[pg];B[pb];W[fc]C[W22: After the pattern is basically set in the upper right corner, the fight moves over to the upper left corner.];B[gc];W[gd];B[fe]LB[ec:a][fb:b]C[The common sequence is B 'a' and W 'b', then Black extends with B25, the simple extension of B25 is a novel move discovered by top pros recently.]
;W[hc];B[gb];W[fb];B[hb];W[cd];B[ce];W[po]C[White first makes the diagonal of W30 as an expedient measure, then approaches the corner with W32, it is a feature of fast games.];B[cb]C[But the youth energetic Gu Li strikes directly on the second line, the play of B33 is very fierce and relentless! The life and death of the upper left corner instantly becomes the focal point of the game.];W[bd];B[db];W[eb];B[bb]

;B[hg];W[if];B[je];W[ff];B[cg];W[gg];B[kc]C[The sequence from W34 to B57 is one way street. But after this, Yu Bin made a big mistake.];W[ab]LB[ac:a]C[The attachment of W58 is a fatal mistake! After the game, both players agree that the diagonal extension at 'a' is the vital point locally! This way the upper left corner would lead a ko that is favorable to White.];B[ac];W[bc];B[dd]
;W[cc];B[da]C[With the killing move of B63, Black captures White's corner by having one eye, Black gains a huge advantage.];W[jf];B[ke];W[di];B[bi];W[bj]C[W66 and W68: White resists tenaciously.];B[ci];W[cj];B[dj];W[cl];B[eg]
;W[ej];B[dk];W[ei]C[Through W76, White puts the turnaround hope to the lower left.];B[qo];W[qn];B[qp];W[pn];B[nq];W[ef];B[df];W[eh]LB[fq:a]C[W84 is a slow move, White should protect the corner at 'a'. This way White may still have a chance.]
;B[fq];W[dq];B[hp]C[The knight's move of B87 is taking the center into account, it is a well balanced move.];W[bh];B[ch];W[dg];B[dh];W[ai];B[ga];W[fp];B[gp];W[fo];B[hn]

;B[ro]C[B109 and B111 are not good, with B109 Black should connect at 'a', when W110, Black can descend at 'b', this is simple and Black is thick.]LB[qq:a][kr:b];W[kr];B[jp];W[ir];B[iq];W[gr];B[jr];W[fr]C[From W112 and W118, White gains a big profit.];B[fn];W[gq]
;B[em];W[dl];B[km]C[In a favorable situation, Black clearly controls the tempo of the game with the sequence from B119 to B123.];W[rn];B[ml]C[With the sequence following B125, Black's purpose is clear, simply settling the shape.];W[nk];B[nl];W[ol];B[lj];W[dn];B[ni];W[of]
;B[ne];W[oj];B[ek]C[B135 seems small but big in reality, it has a big impact on the endgame later on. So far, Black's advantage can't be altered.];W[pa];B[oa];W[qa];B[nb];W[gk];B[fk];W[gj];B[dm];W[cm];B[cn]
