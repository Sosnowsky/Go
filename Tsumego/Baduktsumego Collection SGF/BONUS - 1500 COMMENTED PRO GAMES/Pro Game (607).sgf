Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[Congratulations to Gu Li, he defeated Lee Sedol and now two Chinese players meet in the final, China will obtain the champion ahead of time.];W[dc];B[pp];W[dp];B[ce]
;W[ci];B[cn]LB[co:a][dn:b][fe:c]C[B7 approaching the corner is Gu Li's unique play and appeared in the games between us, it is an asking move, if White makes the diagonal at 'a', B 'b', later on Black will jump to 'c'.];W[cl];B[gc];W[ed];B[jd]C[Through B11, the result is just as Gu Li wishes.];W[fq];B[bc];W[df]
;B[cf];W[dg];B[bh];W[bb]LB[cp:a]C[The attachment of W18 is questionable, its value is not very big. White can consider to play at 'a'.];B[cc];W[cb];B[eb];W[db];B[bi];W[cj];B[bj];W[bk]
;B[cp];W[cq];B[bq];W[co];B[bp];W[do];B[cr];W[bo];B[dq]C[Through B35, Black has a lot of territory, Black's opening is relatively successful.];W[lc];B[oc];W[jc];B[ic]
;W[kd]C[Since White is favorable in ko threats, Lee Sedol uses the unusual tactic of making a ko with W38 and W40.];B[jb];W[kb];B[kc];W[ac];B[bd];W[jc];B[dk];W[ck];B[kc];W[de];B[cg];W[jc]
;B[ke];W[je];B[id];W[jf];B[le];W[ld];B[ne]C[Through B59, it forms a chaotic fight.];W[nc];B[md]C[B61 is a strong move.];W[mc]LB[mb:a]C[W62 is a careless move, White can consider to hang at 'a'.];B[od]C[After Black retreats with B63, White lacks one ko threat and already doesn't have any good tactic.]
;W[ib];B[kc];W[ob];B[jc];W[pb];B[lb];W[mb];B[ka];W[qc];B[rc]LB[rd:a]C[The hane of B73 is unnecessary, Black should descend at 'a' and this way Black can ensure sente, Black is clearly favorable.];W[rb];B[rd]
;W[pg]C[The counterattack of W76 is sharp.];B[sb];W[pe]LB[na:a]C[White's tactic following W78 is not successful. With W78 White should make eyes at 'a', the situation will be complicated.];B[pd];W[nd];B[oe];W[me];B[mf];W[lf];B[md];W[ad]
;B[me];W[ae];B[ma]C[Through B89, it forms an exchange, Black achieves a big advantage.];W[qk];B[qm];W[nq];B[ok]LB[ol:a][nk:b][oj:c][nl:d]C[The cap of B93 is unnecessary. With B93 Black should make the knight's move at 'a', next W93, B 'b', W 'c' and B 'd', this way Black takes chance to enter into the center, it is relatively simple and clear.];W[pl];B[on]
;W[ol];B[pq];W[pn];B[qn];W[nn]C[W100 is a strong move.];B[np];W[mp];B[no];W[mo];B[nm];W[mn];B[om];W[mk]C[Through W108, White's moyo in the center is significant, but the game is still to Black's advantage.]

;W[jp];B[ip];W[jr];B[ir];W[iq];B[ag];W[af]LB[bf:a]C[W128 is a surprising move, it is also due to Lee Sedol's tenacious spirit. The common move is to make the diagonal at 'a', but Black clearly has much more ko threats.];B[jq];W[na];B[nb];W[iq];B[ch]
;W[bf];B[jq];W[io];B[oi];W[oh];B[nj];W[mj];B[nh];W[mi];B[ph];W[og];B[qi]LB[pi:a]C[B145 is a big mistake, Black should connect at 'a', this way Black can kill White cleanly with one move, Black's advantage can't be altered.]
;W[ri];B[rh];W[pi]C[White's tactic following W148 is also questionable and should be reserved. In this situation, ko threats is very important.];B[pj];W[qj];B[qh];W[sh];B[rg];W[rf];B[rj];W[sj];B[si];W[er]
;B[dr];W[ri];B[ql];W[rk];B[pk]C[Through B163, White is left with the option of making life, objectively White needs one move, but after Black handles cleanly, the game is still slightly to Black's advantage.];W[iq];B[gg];W[ge];B[jq]LB[hf:a]C[B167: Black should make the diagonal at 'a', this way White is not easy to kill Black. Only if these two black stones are safe, Black can win the game.];W[hf];B[ep]
;W[iq]LB[eo:a][fo:b]C[W170: White can consider to press at 'a' or clamp at 'b', this way the situation is still a little chaotic.];B[eo];W[en];B[dn];W[bn];B[fn];W[em];B[jq];W[fo];B[fp];W[go]
;B[gp];W[ho]C[The set pattern through W182 is Black's simple and clear winning picture.];B[mh];W[lh];B[lg];W[kh];B[rl]C[After Black captures White with B187, White already has no chance to win.];W[iq];B[ec];W[dd];B[jq];W[kg]
