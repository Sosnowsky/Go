;W[pr];B[qq];W[kq];B[fc];W[cf];B[db];W[cl]C[The first fight between them starts from the invasion of W24.];B[dl];W[dk];B[ck]LB[ek:a][dm:b][cj:c]C[As to the wedge of W26, with B27 Black certainly should cut and atari from below, if Black ataris at 'a' instead, then W27, B 'b' and W 'c', White crosses over, this way Black obviously fails.]

;B[hl];W[ik];B[jm];W[bh];B[ch];W[cg];B[eh];W[cc];B[fe]LB[cj:a][cm:b][gh:c]C[From B27 to B49, the local variation comes to an end, Black can take one stone at 'a' and also can connect together with B49, however White still needs to reinforce at 'b', Black is favorable for the game. During the process, with W48 White can also consider to cap at 'c', preventing Black from making connection.];W[kk]
;B[jp];W[jq];B[ip]LB[hp:a][cm:b][gn:c]C[The extension of B53 is a mistake, Black should jump to 'a' instead, White still needs to reinforce at 'b', this way, next W 'c' would be not that severe.];W[cm];B[gh];W[gn];B[gp]LB[il:a]C[The counterattack of B57 is unreasonable, Black can only simply attach at 'a'.];W[ho]LB[in:a][jn:b][il:c]C[In the game, if White jumps to 'a' instead, next B 'b' and W 'c', Black's five stones would get captured. In the game W58 is also playable.]
;B[fn];W[hp];B[hq]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.];W[gq];B[go];W[iq]LB[hn:a][fq:b][fo:c][jn:d]C[W64 is a serious mistake! With this move, White certainly should connect at 'a', next no matter whether Black plays at 64 or 'b', White can all cut and atari at 'c', since White can escape by attaching out at 'd', White can fight.];B[hn]C[Black is able to capture one stone with B65, White incurs a considerable loss! Black is favorable.];W[hr]
;B[jh]C[Black encloses territory with B67 and also indirectly attacks White's several stones in the center, Black sails smoothly, but afterwards both Black and White have made several consecutive mistakes.];W[lc];B[kc];W[kb];B[kd]LB[lb:a][mc:b][mb:c]C[The first mistake is B71, if Black cuts and ataris at 'a', followed by W 'b' and B 'c', White would have no follow-up moves, Black can win the game easily!];W[mb];B[jb];W[nd];B[ph]LB[pg:a]C[The next one is B75, Black should retreat and make the shoulder-hit at 'a', this way White's three groups are not alive and White can't avoid a bitter battle.]
;W[qg];B[qi];W[ri];B[pi];W[qj];B[md]LB[ne:a][mc:b][pg:c]C[The biggest mistake is B81, White is able to extend at 'a', Black is almost collapsing, however after W 'a', Black can't kill White. With B81, Black can only press at 'c', this way Black would still take the initiative in the game.];W[ne];B[pg];W[mc];B[qf]

;B[rb];W[pa];B[ob]LB[jl:a]C[B101 is a little damaging, this is also the big losing cause of this game. Now Black can only double up at 'a'.];W[nb];B[lb];W[mf];B[mh];W[kb];B[rh];W[sh];B[lb];W[ra]

White surprisingly allows Black to crawl at 'a' in sente, the outcome of the game again becomes unclear.];B[cb];W[bb];B[dc];W[cd];B[qm];W[ql]
