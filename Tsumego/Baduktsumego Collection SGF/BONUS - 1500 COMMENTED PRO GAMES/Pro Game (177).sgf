;B[bd];W[cg]LB[cc:a]C[The attachment of W8 is more positive than the diagonal's extension at 3-3.];B[dg];W[ch];B[dh]LB[cc:a][bf:b]C[B11: Black has several choices, to simply make the diagonal at 'a' or descend at 'b' is also possible.];W[bf];B[ce];W[cj];B[di]
;W[ck];B[cc];W[dc];B[be];W[ic];B[fq];W[dn];B[ip];W[qn];B[po]LB[qp:a][qk:b]C[B25: If Black makes the diagonal at 'a' instead, White will make the two-space extension at 'b', it easily leads to a close game, the play in the game is initiative.];W[rp]
;B[ql]
(;W[qq]LB[pn:a][qo:b][ro:c][rm:d][on:e][pl:f][om:g][pk:h][ko:i]C[W28: If White simply presses at 'a', then W 'b', B 'c', B28, W 'd', B 'e', W 'f' and W 'h', Black would be left with an excellent point to reinforce at 'i', White is not satisfied (see var a).];B[pr];W[pn]C[Therefore, White elects to make the diagonal's extension of W28, then press out with W30.];B[on]
;W[om]LB[pm:a]C[However, the hane of W32 worth study, I think turning at 'a' is a patient and better move.];B[pm];W[oo];B[nn];W[pp];B[op];W[qo];B[no];W[ol];B[qj];W[ko];B[po]
;W[kq];B[qr];W[rk];B[qk];W[rl];B[rj];W[qm];B[pl];W[ir]LB[sk:a][rr:b][qp:c][rq:d][rm:e]C[Through W52, I feel that Black is not bad, because Black can hane at 'a' later on, White can't save the two stones and can only hang at 'b', then B 'c', W 'd' and B 'e', Black can take two stones in sente and should be very happy!]
;B[dq];W[cq];B[ep]LB[cr:a][eq:b][dr:c][er:d]C[The tiger's move of B55 and the initiation of ko are the losing cause in this game. Black thought he had more ko threats, in fact White takes the chance to give up the group on the right side. Actually for Black to hane at 'a', then W 'b' and B 'c', next no matter whether White connects at 55 or pushes at 'd', Black is no bad in either case.];W[dr];B[er];W[eq];B[sk];W[rr];B[dq]
;W[eo];B[cp];W[eq];B[qp];W[fp];B[rq]C[Through the exchange up to B67, Black has almost incurred a loss of one move.];W[nc];B[nd]LB[ob:a]C[B69: For Black to make the knight's move at 'a' would be better.];W[qc]LB[qd:a]C[W70 entering the corner is very alert, Black is hard to make up his mind. Blocking at 'a' and letting White crawl back is not to Black's content.]
;B[oc];W[qd]C[However, in the game after White crawls with W72, Black has no good follow-up maneuver either.];B[jc]C[B73: Because there is no good point to play, Black tries to find a thread of playing.];W[jd];B[kd];W[kc];B[jb];W[ib];B[kb];W[qf]C[The sequence from W74 to B79 is very simple, after White gets to jump with W80, Black is already clearly in an unfavorable situation.];B[id];W[je]
;B[hd];W[gb];B[mc]LB[lc:a]C[B85: Black certainly should take at 'a'.];W[hf];B[ge];W[ke]LB[ff:a]C[In the game, White dare not answer W88, otherwise if White jumps to 'a', Black's three stones would be dangerous, but after one stone being taken by White with sente, Black's situation has deteriorated.];B[gf];W[ld];B[lc];W[hh]
;B[jo];W[kn];B[jq];W[jr];B[kp]C[Initiating a ko with B93 and B95 is an unusual tactic, which is a desperate struggle in a bad situation.];W[lp];B[lq];W[jp];B[hc];W[hb];B[kp];W[kr];B[lo]
;W[jp];B[cb];W[db];B[kp];W[mp];B[mq];W[jp];B[ed];W[de]C[The ko threat of B113 is very farfetched, after being pushed by W114, Black's shape becomes very thin, but now Black already has no other good choice.];B[fd];W[gc];B[if];W[hg]
;B[df];W[fg];B[gg];W[gh];B[ie];W[jg];B[ee];W[gd];B[he];W[fa];B[kp];W[jn]LB[mo:a][io:b]C[After the turn of W130, Black again has no good follow-up, even if Black continues to fight the ko at 'a', White can atari at 'b', Black is no good.]
;B[ig]C[Therefore, Black elects to push with B131, trying to mess up the situation, but this is just to Cho 9p's delight.];W[ih];B[jh];W[kg];B[ki];W[mh];B[mi];W[ni];B[mj];W[jp]C[White still gets the chance to take the ko with W140. Now for Black to kill White in the center is almost impossible, in the process we can see Cho Hunhyun 9p's strong and relentless style, if he can win the game by 20 points, he won't win it by 19 points.];B[ia];W[ha]

;W[oh];B[pj];W[og]C[The sequence from W146 to B158 is handled very brilliantly, not giving Black any chance, so far Black is trailing about 10 points on the board, this game can be considered as Cho Hunhyun's famous game while taking White.];B[oe];W[ph];B[ci];W[ff];B[fe];W[fi];B[ef];W[bi];B[ej];W[hk]
