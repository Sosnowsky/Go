Source:China Sports Weekly,
Translation:GoGameWorld.];B[pd]C[Finally here comes a heavyweight game, however it is a little disappointed that Lee Changho surprisingly conceded defeat after only 131 moves.];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[qo]C[B1, B3 and B5 is the "Kobayashi Style", this opening brings us back to the eighties and nineties.]
;W[jq];B[cn];W[fp];B[cj]LB[bp:a][cm:b][cq:c]C[B9 making the three-space extension is a trend, because if Black enters the corner with the knight's move at 'a', White will definitely attach at 'b' instead of making the diagonal's extension at 'c'.];W[cg]LB[ch:a][cl:b][cf:c]C[How to play W10? Checking tightly at 'a' is good for the invasion at 'b' but bad for protecting the corner; making the small knight's move at 'c' is just the opposite. In the game, White elects to make the large knight's move in order to get both, but this may accomplish nothing in the end.];B[lq]C[The extension of B11 is still very big.]
;W[cl]C[The invasion of W12 is played with a state of mind.];B[bl];W[bm];B[cm];W[bk];B[bn];W[ck];B[cq]TR[cg]C[From the attachment of B13 to the corner-striking of B19, it leads an exchange, the position of the marked white stone is not ideal.];W[cp];B[bp];W[nc]
;B[qf]C[B23: For Black to answer with the small knight's move is my favorite play, White would have no good splitting point on the right side.];W[jd];B[cc]C[B25: For Black to enter the corner is perhaps what Lee Changho has expected.];W[dc];B[cd];W[ce];B[be];W[bf];B[de];W[cf];B[db];W[eb]
;B[cb];W[fc];B[bd];W[ff]LB[el:a][br:b][ko:c][ne:d][ee:e][fd:f][bo:g]C[W38: The sequence from W26 to W38 is Lee's joseki, particularly the strengthening move of W38 is his favorite shape. However, now White has outside thickness, then this move would be unnecessary! Here White certainly hopes Black would escape, by attacking,  White can take the opportunity to destroy Black's moyo on the right side. I think White should first jump to 'a', Black has to protect Black's wedge at 'g', so Black probably would hang at 'b', White then can make the knight's move at 'c' or jump to 'd' to expand his moyo. If Black extends out at 'e', then White can double up at 'f', this would lead to a situation where only Black one side has to escape.];B[br];W[el];B[jp]C[Due to the slow move of W38, Black gets to play the vital point at 41, forcing White to reduce Black's moyo, White's opening seems half-step slow.]
;W[ip];B[jo];W[kq];B[lp];W[qp]C[The attachment of W46 to probe Black is an advanced strategy.];B[rp]C[B47: Because the outside is thick, so Black elects to hane down, not leaving any aji for White to take advantage of, it is Yoo's style.];W[pp];B[qq];W[po];B[qn];W[rq];B[rr]
;W[ro];B[sq];W[pl];B[pn];W[qh]C[With the ensuing sequence from W48 to W58, White just has simply handled the situation, this can only be explained as that Lee Changho cannot figure out a better way.];B[me]LB[qj:a][pj:b][ne:c][pi:d]C[Black has obtained the big corner and still aims at the invasion at 'a' or 'b', next Black can leisurely play at 59, Black has taken the initiative. Looking back, it seems that White should reserve the aji in the corner, and take the vital point at 'c', after Black encloses at 'd', then consider the reduction.];W[pc]TR[pl][qh]C[After W60, White counter-attacks and also looks after the two marked white stones.]
;B[qc];W[od];B[pe];W[nf];B[ke];W[lc];B[je];W[ie];B[if];W[he];B[pb]TR[ff]C[Because of the existence of the marked white stone, Black generously lets White to enclose territory on the upper side, when Black ataris at 71, White can only exercise patience, Black feels miserable.];W[oc]
;B[kh];W[li];B[hf];W[gf];B[hh];W[fh];B[ki]C[After this move, it is time for lunch break.];W[rg];B[rf];W[rm];B[gq]C[B83 is intense! White can only reinforce with one move on the right and upper side.];W[gp]LB[iq:a]C[W84: White has no choice, after White protects the cut at 'a', Black's profit is huge!]
;B[hq];W[iq];B[er];W[io];B[jm];W[kp]C[W90: Under an unfavorable situation, this counter-attack is inevitable.];B[ko];W[lo];B[lm];W[hm]LB[lr:a][mo:b]C[However it is hard to understand why White elects to tenuki and reinforce at 94! This is clearly of a winning attitude, but in fact it is just the opposite! White obviously should hane at 'a', then extend at 'b' in order to have a chance of winning.]
;B[pi]LB[ph:a][qj:b]C[B95 is a good move! White can't press at 'a', otherwise Black would make the diagonal's extension at 'b'.];W[qj];B[ph]LB[ne:a]C[B97: Black aims to push and cut at 'a'. So far, Black's victory is already not far away.];W[pj];B[fi]C[B99: Black reinforces again with sente to settle the shape.];W[ei];B[gh];W[fg];B[fj]
;W[ej];B[lr]C[Black again grabs the game-deciding point at 105, it is hard for White to turn the game around.];W[mm];B[mn];W[rn]LB[nn:a][no:b]C[W108: If White hanes at 'a', Black can counter-hane at 'b', White has no follow-up maneuver.];B[fm]C[B109: Although under a favorable situation, Yoo Changhyeok still releases the strong move.];W[em];B[fl];W[fn];B[nn]C[After taking advantage in sente, Black comes back to reinforce at 113, the difference for both sides has been enlarged.]
;W[ob];B[fk];W[eo];B[am]LB[bj:a]C[After the hane of B117, Black is left with the clamping move at 'a', the aji is very bad for White.];W[ae]C[White is forced to strengthen with the hane move of W118.];B[da]LB[id:a][ic:b][kd:c][bj:d]C[The stand of B119 is a good move! So far, White can't take care of everything at the same time and has to call off the battle in a hurry. If White continues, Black's cut at 'a' would be a good move, White has no choice but to atari at 'b', Black can then push at 'c' and get a huge profit, besides the clamp at 'd' is still working. So the only play left for White is to concede defeat gracefully.];W[af]

The game 2 will take place on 6/2.
