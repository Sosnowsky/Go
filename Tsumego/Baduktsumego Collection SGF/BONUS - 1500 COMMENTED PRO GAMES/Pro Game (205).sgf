Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[pd]C[Seo Bongsoo was once one of "four great kings" in Korea. Although now his overall performance is not that splendid as before, but with his wild-leopard-sharp strength, no opponent dares to underestimate.];W[dp];B[fq];W[cn];B[qp]
;W[dd];B[kq]C[Through B7, Black forms "Mini Chinese Fuseki".];W[qf]C[W8: White approaches the corner instead splits the right side, this is relatively popular nowadays in Korea .];B[qh];W[of];B[nc];W[pi]C[The jump of W10 and the cap of W12 are planned tactic, White aims to destroy Black's intention of forming a moyo.];B[ph]LB[qe:a][qi:b]C[B13: Black pushes and cuts directly, it is intense, if Black makes diagonal at 'a', White will block down at 'b'.];W[oh]
;B[oi];W[qi];B[ri]C[The hane of B17 is a good point.];W[rj];B[rh];W[qj]LB[rg:a][qg:b]C[W18 and W20 are simple and clear. If White cuts at 19 with W18, Black will play atari at 'a', and White wraps up with the atari at 'b' and has no very severe follow-up tactics.];B[qe]LB[og:a][pf:b]C[The diagonal bump of B21 is a clever move. If Black plays atari at 'a' directly then separates one white stone at 'b', it is crude.];W[nh]
;B[rf];W[nj]C[Through W24, White captures one black stone and achieves his strategic target of taking outside influence, however Black also obtains corner territory, locally Black is a little favorable.];B[op]C[B25 protecting the corner is very big.];W[df]C[White jumps with W26, both sides take what they need, the game appears steady. From here, we can feel Lee Sedol seems to become more mature. In the past, he always takes initiative and attacks first, and now he becomes more patient.];B[fo];W[dk];B[cq];W[dq];B[dr];W[cp];B[br];W[bq]
;B[cr];W[ic];B[ci]C[The invasion of B37 declares the opening is over.];W[ck]C[W38 is a steady move.];B[cc]LB[be:a][bd:b]C[Black first strikes the corner with B39, then makes the knight's move at 'a', Black's thinking is nimble. If Black directly plays at 'a', Black worries that White will attach down at 'b'.];W[dc];B[be];W[cd];B[cg];W[eh]
;B[bj];W[bk];B[bh]C[Through B47, it is not difficult for Black to make life.];W[lc]C[White makes two-space extension with W48 in no hurry and continues to cultivate his moyo at the top, White is also not hasty to destroy Black's moyo at the bottom, this shows Lee 3p is very confident to beat veteran.];B[bd];W[bc];B[ce];W[de];B[ld]C[B53: Black wants to break through the blockade.];W[od]LB[oc:a][mc:b]C[The attachment of W54 is a strong move. If Black blocks at 'a', White has the vicious move at 'b'.]
;B[kc]C[Black counterattacks resolutely with B55.];W[oc]C[Following W56, it forms an exchange.];B[lb];W[qc];B[rd];W[dh];B[ak];W[cf];B[bf];W[ch];B[ag];W[pe]
;B[qd];W[rc];B[sd];W[dg];B[bg];W[jb];B[id];W[hd];B[ob];W[nd];B[mc];W[pb];B[nb]
;W[pc];B[ie];W[he];B[hc];W[gc];B[hb];W[gb]C[Through W86, White is thick, but the outcome of the game is still unclear, the focus now moves to Black's territory at the bottom.];B[bl];W[bm];B[ko];W[if];B[qm]C[B89 and B91: Black continues to reinforce the bottom.]
;W[pq]C[When Black's moyo almost becomes territory and Black is already leading the game, White strikes with W92, Lee Sedol starts to show the fighting skill of "genius youth".];B[qq];W[mq];B[np];W[pn];B[qo];W[iq]C[W92, W94, W96 and W98, these several moves, look like "drop beans and become soldiers".];B[ol];W[ok];B[jp];W[gp];B[eq]
;W[gq];B[do];W[bp];B[cl];W[dl];B[eo];W[fr];B[er];W[cm];B[ho]C[B113: Black seals off White, White seems to have no way to make life.];W[io]C[The attachment of W114 is an asking move.];B[hn]C[B115 is strong and unyielding.]
;W[lp]C[White peeps from outside with W116, it is a clever move! Black is very uncomfortable.];B[ip];W[jq]C[W118 is a brilliant move to make life. Here White surprisingly becomes ko-alive, to Black this is a very big burden. 

Later on, although Black plays very tenaciously, the game is also very intense, but overall White is always leading in the game.];B[lq];W[hr];B[hp];W[jr];B[kr];W[is];B[fs];W[gs];B[gr]
