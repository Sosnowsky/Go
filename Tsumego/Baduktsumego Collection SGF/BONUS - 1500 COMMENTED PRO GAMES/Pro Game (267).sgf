In Xie He's game, Park YuongHoon did play many questionable moves, but Xie He didn't grab the chance, it is a pity!];W[dc]

;B[pe]C[... the answer of B29 and B31 is weird too.];W[qf]C[This leads to the same variation as White approaches with W30 and Black plays the diagonal's extension of B29.];B[oe];W[pi]C[White gets to play at 32 and has nothing to complain.];B[nk];W[pk]C[The attachment of W34 is to destroy Black's shape.];B[qk]LB[ol:a]C[B35: The proper move is to retreat at 'a'.];W[qj];B[ok];W[pj]
;B[om]C[B39: Black attaches on White's side, no matter what happens, it is not a good move.];W[pn];B[rl];W[ng];B[ni];W[md]LB[qm:a][rj:b]C[The ensuing White's play is questionable. As to the one-step slow push of B43, White only needs to peep at 'a' then descend at 'b'. In the game, after White invades with W44, Black certainly will counterattack.];B[mf];W[rd]LB[rj:a][rh:b]C[Although White gets to attach with W46, but the stone of W44 is affected, also in the future after Black's tiger at 'a', the clamp at 'b' is very severe! White has incurred some loss.]

;W[kb];B[lb];W[fb];B[eb];W[jb]LB[mb:a][cb:b]C[After the hane of W60, White stresses at the clamp at 'a' with W62 and W64, but after being crawled by B 'a' in sente, White is also very painful, with W62, White is better to block at 'b'.];B[cf];W[bf];B[cb];W[bd];B[fe];W[cj]LB[co:a][bb:b][dg:c][ch:d][kq:e][mb:f]C[The two-space extension of W70 is a very bad move! Now even if White wants to play on the left side, White should protect the corner at 'a'! Later on White can directly attack Black and enclose territory as well by playing at 'b',or enclose territory in a big scale at 'c'. In the game after W70, White has lost many options and also Black is left with the tactic of playing the clamp at 'd'! The correct play for W70 is, the first choice is to protect the corner at 'a', the second choice is to invade at 'e', the third one is to clamp at 'f', these choices are all better than the play in the game.

After this move, it is time for noon break.]
;B[co];W[gq];B[jd]LB[rj:a][rh:b]C[After the hane of B73, immediately clamping at 'b' is excellent timing! Because the turn of B73 is a good and handy ko threat, Black will establish superiority at one stroke.];W[id];B[mc];W[ge];B[gf];W[he];B[rj];W[ri];B[cq]
;W[cr];B[br]C[After B81 and B83, Black's situation is not bad, but Black has already lost his chance.];W[jq]LB[kq:a]C[The attachment of W84 is a tesuji, but in the current situation, White's invasion at 'a' is a severe game-deciding move!];B[jr];W[kr];B[kq];W[jp];B[lr]C[Black makes compromise with the sequence from B85 to B89.];W[bq];B[cp];W[bs]
;B[cl];W[bb]LB[ch:a]C[W94: White has to guard against Black's clamp at 'a'.];B[ip]C[Through B95, Black is still favorable for the game.];W[ar];B[ep];W[dl]C[After the attachment of W98, because of favorable situation, Black becomes conservative.];B[cm]LB[bm:a]C[Black's first bad move is the retreat of B99, Black should make the diagonal's extension at 'a', which is the shape for living.];W[ck];B[eh]LB[gh:a]C[Next with B101 Black should strengthen at 'a'.]
