(;B[fp]LB[dp:a][dq:b][co:c][cq:d][gq:e][qk:f]C[B7 is a thoughtful play, if Black directly bumps againt White at 'a', then W 'b', B 'c', White can connect at 'd', B7 and W 'e' (see var a). In the game, if White retreats to 'b', Black can tenuki to form the "Chinese Opening" by playing at 'f'.];W[fq]C[W8 initiates a direct confrontation.];B[dp];W[dq];B[co]C[Through 11, it leads to the complicated "large avalanche" joseki.];W[gp]
;B[cq];W[bp];B[cr];W[bo];B[gq];W[go]C[The play of W18 was seen in the old times, but very rarely nowadays.];B[dn];W[cn];B[do];W[dm]LB[dr:a]C[If next B23 turns at 'a', it will result in a simple variation of Black's territory and White's outside thickness.]
(;B[fn]LB[cm:a][bn:b][dr:c][hq:d][gr:e][cl:f]C[B23 is very strong, the normal sequence is B 'a', W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 'e' and W 'f' (see var a).

;W[bn];B[bm]C[Through 31, it forms a complicated variation.];W[ck];B[bk];W[dl];B[am]C[B35 is a exiquisite play of extending liberties.];W[bq];B[br]C[Through 37, Awaji sinks into a deep meditation. In the study room, pros including Kobayashi Koichi think this is a complicated position, which has no set pattern.];W[bj]LB[jq:a][gm:b][fl:c][bl:d]C[W38 is not appropriate, now White should hane at 'a', Black has to jump to 'c' to defend against being sealed in by Black's move at 'b', then White plays the hane move at 38. Yu Bin thinks that W38 is worth study, in the currect position even if Black simply connects at 'd', White is no good either, furthermore...]
;B[jq]LB[bl:a]C[B39 is played after Shao has thought for a long time, it is a more relentless play than the move at 'a'. B39 at 'a' is more solid, then W 39.];W[jr]LB[bl:a][aq:b][dr:c][fr:d]C[If W40 reduces liberties at 'a', then B 'b' first hanes at 'b' with sente, then B 'c', White is short in liberties in the capturing race, so White has to crawl at 40, Black then plays at 'd', resulting in an exchange.];B[dr];W[es];B[bl];W[kq];B[cf]C[For the result up to 45, Black can be satisfied.]
;W[jp];B[fl];W[fk]LB[gl:a][gn:b]C[W48 is a good move, if Black extends to 'a' next, the W 'b', Black is very difficult.];B[fc]C[Black tenukis to double approach the corner with B49, it is a very positive play.];W[ee];B[cc];W[gl];B[gn];W[qo];B[qp]
;W[po];B[nq]C[The play of B55 and B57 is a very smart strategy when being outnumbered.];W[qf];B[pi]C[The pincer of B59 is certain.];W[of];B[nd];W[pk]C[W62 is a cannot-slip-by good point.];B[mi]C[After B63, it forms a position which Black is easier to play.];W[mf];B[ld];W[nk]
;B[qh]C[B67 attacks and defends, White is not comfortable.];W[kf];B[qe];W[qg];B[qk];W[ql];B[qj];W[rl];B[ki]C[B75 is worth study.];W[oh];B[oi];W[ni]C[W78 is unexpectedly strong.]
;B[nh];W[nj];B[ng];W[oe]LB[og:a][nf:b]C[If B82 at 'a', then B 'b', White needs to shorten liberties to kill Black, so White is not favorable.];B[og];W[od];B[oc];W[pc];B[qc];W[pg];B[ph]

;W[gg];B[ro]C[B141 tenukis to grab the big endgame, apparently Black is confident to make life the big dragon.];W[rn];B[rp];W[cd]C[W144 dares not to kill Black either.];B[lk];W[ll];B[kk];W[mk];B[no]C[Through 149, most pros in the study room think Black will win.];W[nn];B[hm]C[B151 looks like the declaration of victory.]
