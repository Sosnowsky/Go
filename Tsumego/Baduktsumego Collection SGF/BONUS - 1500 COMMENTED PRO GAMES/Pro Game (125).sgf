Translation:GoGameWorld.];B[qd]C[In the semi finals of the 16th Chinese Mingren title, Yu Bin 9p defeated Dong Yan 7p and advanced to the challenger final, he will compete with Qiu Jun 6p for the right to challenge the title holder Zhou Heyang 9p.];W[dc];B[pp];W[dq];B[de]
;W[ce];B[cf];W[cd];B[co]LB[do:a]C[B9: Normally Black will play the high approach at 'a', thus the upper and lower side's shapes become same, it would lead to a situation of White's territory battling with Black's outside influence.];W[dk];B[cm];W[cp]LB[fp:a][bq:b][iq:c]C[W12: White can also make the knight's move at 'a', followed by B 'b' and W 'c'.];B[ep]
;W[eq];B[dp];W[cq];B[fp];W[gq]C[Through 18, Black has nothing to complain.];B[gf];W[el]C[W20 is a heavy move and should be reserved.];B[en]LB[bo:a][bn:b][do:c][cn:d][gp:e]C[After the jump of B21, Black becomes very thick; If B21 is omitted, after W 'a', B 'b', W 'c' and B 'd', later on White can attach at 'e', Black looks thin.]
;W[df];B[dg];W[ef];B[eg];W[ee];B[cg]LB[fg:a][ch:b][bf:c][bg:d]C[B27 reflects Yu Bin's ardently love for territory, but Black should extend at 'a', followed by W27, B 'b', W 'c', B 'd' and White connects, Black would be very thick, White is no good.];W[fg];B[ej];W[ff]LB[gg:a][fh:b]C[The connection of W30 is a big slow move! For White to press at 'a' would be much better.]
;B[fh]C[B31: Black takes the opportunity to play the hane here.];W[gg];B[gh];W[hg];B[gl]TR[dk][el]LB[fm:a]C[Through the cap of B35, Black's shape is perfect, however White dares not to pull out the marked two stones by playing at 'a'.];W[lc];B[nc];W[le];B[ne]
;W[hh];B[gj];W[rd]LB[qj:a]C[W42: For White to play the splitting move at 'a' is common, in the game White attaches on the second line to seek the tempo of playing, but the result is no good, because Black has played very well in this area.];B[re];W[qe];B[pe];W[qf];B[rf]C[B45 and B47 are strong moves.];W[pf]LB[qg:a][rg:b][qh:c][qc:d]C[W48: White has no other choice, if White extends at 'a' as the common shape demands, then B 'b', W 'c' and B 'd', White would become cumbersome and gain very little.]
;B[qg]LB[pd:a]C[W48: In the game, White expects Black would reinforce at 'a', but B49 is a surprisingly good move! Black puts more importance on the right side territory.];W[pd];B[qc];W[oe];B[pg];W[og]LB[nf:a]C[W54: White can't make the tiger's move at 'a', otherwise Black would extend at 54, White would become over-concentrated.];B[nf];W[of];B[pc];W[ng]
;B[pi];W[mb]LB[lb:a]C[W60 looks small but big in reality, if being attached at 'a' by Black in sente, White would be difficult to tolerate.];B[lh]LB[ni:a]C[B61 is a novel and fresh play! Normally Black will jump to 'a'.];W[mi];B[kj];W[mf];B[ni];W[qn];B[ql];W[pl]
;B[qk];W[nj];B[oj];W[nh];B[oi];W[qq];B[qp];W[pq];B[op];W[rp];B[ro];W[rq];B[qo]
;W[nq];B[mh];W[gp]LB[np:a][no:b]C[If White jumps to 'a', Black will take chance to enclose territory with the hane move at 'b', White doesn't like it.];B[mo];W[bo];B[bn];W[do];B[cn];W[fo];B[eo];W[nb]LB[fm:a][lo:b][ln:c]TR[dk][el]C[W92 is the losing move! It is too small! Because White has the tactic of playing the diagonal's move at 'a', now White should attach at 'b' or make the shoulder hit at 'c', aiming to pull out the marked two stones by playing at 'a', this is the direction of playing.]
;B[kf];W[oc];B[ob];W[od];B[go]LB[fm:a]C[B97 is alert! The tactic of White's diagonal's extension at 'a' is not working any more, which is regrettable for White. Black has established his superiority.];W[ho];B[gn];W[ko];B[je];W[id];B[jd];W[jc]
;B[mq];W[nr];B[lo];W[kk];B[lj];W[kn];B[kq]LB[lm:a]C[But B111 is unreasonable! Now only if Black encloses territory with a jump at 'a', Black would lead about 10 points on the board, the victory would be within Black's hands.];W[mm]C[After White makes the knight's move of W112 regardless of anything else, Black also can't see it clear where the route to victory is.];B[hp];W[hq];B[ip]
;W[iq];B[jp];W[rn];B[pn];W[on];B[oo];W[jh]LB[kp:a][jq:b][lp:c][mp:d][lq:e][mr:f][lr:g]C[W112: However, just in this crucial moment, White unexpectedly breaks away from the main battle field, it is inexplicable! If White squeezes at 'a' instead, then B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f' and W 'g', this situation would become completely unclear! Here White do have a chance but he elects to capture three unimportant black stones instead!]
;B[jq]C[B123: Black is quick to reinforce! After this move, the game is over. After White comes back to make trouble in Black's territory again, it equals to that White has wasted one move.];W[ik];B[jk]LB[ij:a]C[B125: In fact, Black can make the cap at 'a', killing White as a whole, there is no problem for this. In the game, after the wedge, White actually "picks up one life".];W[hj];B[jj]LB[jl:a]C[B127 is unnecessary, if Black extends at 'a', White would have no chance.];W[gk];B[fk];W[hl];B[hk]
;W[rg];B[rc];W[gk];B[hm];W[gi];B[hk];W[sf];B[sd];W[gk];B[fj];W[il]LB[jl:a][hk:b]C[W142: White has no other choices, if White hangs at 'a', then Black will take the ko at 'b', White has no ko threats.]
;B[fi];W[ij];B[km]C[B145 is a good move! White in the center has been all killed.];W[so];B[qm];W[pm];B[po];W[mr];B[jm];W[mp];B[lp];W[lq];B[no]
;W[ln];B[kp];W[fl];B[gm];W[di];B[ci];W[lg]TR[jh][jd][je][kf]C[W162: After the marked white stone, White has completely captured the marked black stones in another 40 moves, this can be considered as a big joke, it is easily seen that how big the mistake was.];B[kh];W[kg];B[mg]
