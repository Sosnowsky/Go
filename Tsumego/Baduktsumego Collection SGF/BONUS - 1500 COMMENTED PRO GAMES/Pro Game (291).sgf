;W[hq];B[cf];W[fc];B[cn]C[B7 and B9 are very popular moves.];W[fp];B[cq];W[dq];B[cp];W[do];B[co];W[po];B[qo]LB[qn:a][qp:b][qk:c]C[The high approach joseki of W16 is a minus to territory after being attached under by B17, still the sequence of White's large knight approach at 'a', Black's diagonal at 'b' and White's two-space extension at 'c' is better for White.]
;W[qn];B[qp];W[pm];B[np]LB[jq:a][nq:b]C[The knight's move of B21 is more or less unsound, Black is aiming at the good extension point at 'a', but the problem is that Black may not get to play 'a', the low extension at 'b' is better.];W[qi];B[qg];W[qc]LB[pp:a][rn:b][qq:c][lq:d]C[W24 placing in the corner is too miserly, White on the whole board becomes thin monentarily. W24 should first squeeze at 'a' to probe Black, if Black doesn't want to give White the sente move of standing at 'b', Black has to connect at 'c', then White can immediately compell at 'd', Black is difficult.]
;B[pc];W[qd];B[pe];W[qe];B[qf];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[nc];W[oi];B[ic];W[bd]LB[pp:a]C[W36 still need to squeeze at 'a' as said earlier.]
;B[jq]C[After Black extends to 37, B21 instead becomes a good move, Black clearly has gained an advantage, Black's opening is successful.];W[dr];B[dn];W[mp]LB[fn:a][gq:b]C[The attachment of W40 is unreasonable, jump reinforcing at 'a' is the proper move, otherwise Black can push out at 'b'.  It is inferior for White to live a group in Black's narrow area.];B[no];W[kp];B[jp];W[nq];B[oq];W[kq]
;B[jo];W[mr];B[gq]C[B49 pushing out is very severe.];W[gp];B[hr];W[hp];B[ir];W[ln]LB[gm:a]C[W54 can only stick her head out near 'a'.];B[hn]C[B55 knight fences White in, Black is very happy.];W[gn];B[eo]
;W[ep];B[gm];W[fn];B[fm];W[en];B[em];W[cr];B[nr];W[mq];B[dh]LB[di:a]C[B67 looks like a certain move, but it is a little questionable.  It is more solid to play the large knight's move at 'a'.];W[cj]C[The invasion of W68 is a game-deciding move, under an inferior situation, this sort of move may bring some chance.]
;B[ej];W[ch];B[cg];W[bh];B[be];W[bl]LB[cl:a]C[The knight's move of W74 is the losing move. W74 should jump to 'a', then Black is somewhat difficult to play.];B[dj];W[ck];B[bm]C[White clearly has overlooked Black can bump with 75, then the diagonal of B77 becomes a good move.];W[bg];B[cd]
;W[cc];B[de]C[B79 and B81 are good moves to set up a ko! Because White is thin across the whole board and has to compromise, but this ko is clearly heavy for White, if Black wins this ko, then White on the left is not completely alive.];W[ce];B[re];W[rd];B[cd];W[dc];B[nm]C[B87 does not continue the ko fight due to lack of severe ko threats, at any rate White is difficult to strengthen.];W[rn];B[ro];W[km];B[jm]
;W[fe]C[The jump of W92 is too leisurely! it always should take the ko first.];B[bc]C[B93 initiates the ko fight and is severe.];W[ce];B[qk]TR[nm]C[Due to the jump of the marked black stone, the invasion of B95 becomes a big ko threat, White has no way to win this ko fight.];W[pj];B[cd];W[kc]LB[ad:a]C[The invasion of W98 is already tactless. After B 'a' takes the ko, White on the left is almost dead. Even under a disadvantage, W98 should first make life on the left.];B[ad];W[cl]
;B[br];W[bs];B[ar];W[fr];B[gr];W[fs];B[ag]C[B107 attaching underneath leaves White without enough eye space.];W[dm];B[jl]LB[ci:a][bi:b][am:c]C[Black feels in such an overwhelming advantage so that B109 does not go all out to kill White, actually Black can wedge at 'a', followed by Black's block at 'b' and White's stand at 'c', consequently White is dead.]
;W[am];B[an];W[cm];B[al];W[ak];B[ap];W[am];B[bn];W[bf];B[af];W[bj];B[jd]C[Black gets to play the diagonal at 121 and takes a big lead, White though fight hard later on, but because White is too weak on the whole board and can't avoid the death of a big dragon.];W[md]
