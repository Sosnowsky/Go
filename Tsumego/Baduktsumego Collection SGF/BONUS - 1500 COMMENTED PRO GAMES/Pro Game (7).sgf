;W[co]LB[dm:a]C[W6 is a common tactic, but to Chang Hao it is a "variation", in game 1, Chang Hao pincered at 'a' and Cho Hunhyun suffered a small loss, today Cho Hunhyun must have prepared for the pincer.];B[dp];W[cp];B[eq];W[cn];B[dn];W[dm];B[cq];W[dr];B[bq];W[cr];B[cm]
;W[cl];B[br];W[er];B[bm];W[bn];B[bl];W[bp]C[Through 24, the position leads to the common "large avalanche" joseki, so far both sides have played very fast.];B[fq];W[en]C[W26 is the invention of Chinese players, not sure what kind of weapon Chang Hao has prepared for Cho Hunhyun!];B[em]LB[ep:a]C[B27: For Black to connect at 'a' is to White's advantage, this is the common understanding among many top players.];W[dl]
;B[fn];W[el]LB[fm:a][bk:b][ap:c][ao:d][fr:e]C[After W30, the ensuing variation of B 'a', W 'b', B 'c', W 'd' and B 'e' was once adopted by Chang Hao when he was playing with Korean players (see var a).]
(;B[eo]LB[fm:a]C[B31 taking is superior to connecting at 'a', this is the conclusion in the postgame analysis.];W[bk];B[fr]LB[bs:a][fl:b]C[After B33, if White wants to capture the three black stones in the corner, then Black's hane move at 'a' is very powerful.];W[gm]C[W34 is a good move.];B[cs];W[ce]TR[fq]C[For the result up to 36, White can be satisfied. Therefore, many pros think the earlier extension of the marked black stone is worth study.];B[hc]LB[ic:a][gc:b]C[B37 is the right spot, if Black extends to 'a', then W 'b' makes White's position too vivid.]
;W[jc]LB[fc:a]C[Since Black has extended one-space wider with B37, for White to block at 'a' is tasteless, so White elects to invade with W38.];B[fc];W[gd]C[W40: White is very initiative.];B[fd]LB[hd:a][ec:b][he:c]C[B41 is the right direction, if B 'a', then W 41, B 'b' and W 'c',  White's configuration on the left side becomes ideal. Chang Hao is pondering, the fight over here is crucial.];W[gc];B[gb];W[hd];B[hb]
;W[id]LB[fe:a][ic:b][ee:c][ff:d][eb:e][fb:f][hf:g][fh:h][dc:i][cc:j][db:k][ed:l][ec:m]C[W46 is solid, if White hanes at 'a', then B 46, W 'b' and B 'c', it leads to a very complicated fight. After 46, Black is pondering, he may think to jump out at 'd', then W 'e', B 'f', W 'g' (see var a), now Black should continue to jump at 'h', attaching at 'i' is not good, after W 'j', B 'k', W 'l', B 'm' and W 'a'  (see var b), White's center moyo is too big. Now if Black reinforces at 'e' or 'k', White will certainly hane at 'a'.]
(;B[fe]LB[ff:a][eb:b][fb:c][hg:d][dc:e][cc:f][db:g][cb:h][ea:i]C[B47 is unexpected, it is not fitting to Cho Hunhyun's style. Comparing with 'a', B47 is more solid, that is to say, after the sequence of W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 'e', W 'f', B 'g', W 'h' and B 'i' (see var a), White can no longer cut at 47.]
(;W[eb];B[fb];W[fg]C[W50: White adopts the strategy of false attacking.];B[hf]C[B51: Black exposes a defect intentionally, because Black at the top is easier to live on the spot, so he is not afraid of White's cut.];W[mc]LB[ge:a][ff:b][eg:c]C[W52: White first settles himself, and also aims to make the push and cut at 'a' more productive. If Black reinforces, like B 'b', then White can go with the flow by retreating at 'c' to enclose territory. Cho Hunhyun is pondering again.];B[ld]LB[lc:a][kd:b][kc:c][md:d][me:e][le:f]C[B53: After thinking for a long time, Black initiates a counter-attack, but if White simply responds like W 'a', B 'b' and W 'c', Black is no good, to be more severe, White can also start a fight with W 'd', B 'e' and W 'f'.]
;W[md];B[lc];W[le]C[W54 and W56 are fierce and ruthless, from this 3-game series, it seems that Chang Hao's moves become more unyielding.];B[mb];W[nb];B[lb];W[ne];B[ke];W[kd];B[lf]LB[je:a][kc:b][jb:c][kf:d][ie:e][jf:f][if:g][ig:h][hg:i][ob:j]C[B63: Black is very happy to atari here, but afterwards Black must reinforce at the top, if B 'a', then W 'b', Black is no good; if B 'c', then White can atari out at 'd', because the sequence of B 'a', W 'e', B 'f', W 'g' and B 'h' is very severe (see var a); But when B 'c', White can also attach at 'g', Black strengthens at 'd' then White can hane at 'i'. Besides, what is noteworthy is that Black is still left with the maneuver of clamping at 'j'.]
(;W[me]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.];B[ob];W[oc];B[na];W[nc];B[jf]LB[kc:a][ka:b][kb:c][ja:d][la:e][ma:f][pb:g][ia:h][jb:i][pc:j][qc:k][qd:l][rc:m][je:n]C[After B69, W 'a', B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f', W 'g' and B 'h' (see var a), although Black can capture White, but White will grab the corner, it is not to Black's advantage; For white to stand at 'i' is not working, B 'g', W 'j', B 'k', W 'l' and B 'm' is a good move (see var b); Furthermore, if White diagonals at 'c', B 'a', White can create a ko at 'n', this ko is more troublesome for White. Chang Hao is pondering.]
(;W[kc]LB[pb:a]C[W70: White is reckless, it seems no better than the atari move at 'a'. During the lunch time, Cho Hunhyun said he didn't expect that Chang Hao would play that fiercely. However, after thorough consideration in the one hour lunch time, the tiger move at B69 is also unexpected by most pros in the study room.];B[pb];W[pc];B[qb]LB[oa:a][ma:b][kb:c][pa:d][qc:e][rc:f][rd:g][rb:h][ra:i][re:j][qd:k][sd:l]C[After B73, White can not kill Black with the sequence of W 'a', B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f', W 'g', B 'h', W 'i', B 'j', W 'k' and B 'l' (see var a).]
(;W[oa];B[ma];W[qc];B[rc];W[rd];B[rb];W[qe]C[W74-W80: White has no choice but to play like this, Black has obviously gained some profit.];B[kb];W[jb];B[ka];W[oq];B[po]C[B85 is a steady move, the overall result of the fight near the top area is to Black's advantage, but there are still so many unsettled area on the board, the game is far from over.]
;W[qk]LB[qj:a]C[W86: In order to win, White fights staunchly, the common move is at 'a'.];B[pq];W[lq];B[or];W[ff];B[ee];W[df]C[W90 and W92 are good moves, White has enclosed a huge territory on the left side by utilizing the dead stones. Cho Hunhyun is in deep meditation.];B[im];W[ok];B[rf]C[B95 is an asking move.];W[sd]
;B[qj]C[B97 is severe, it is greedy that Black wants to win quickly by destroying all White's territory.  The atomsphere in the study room is very constrained, Liu Shizheng 6p thinks White's miscalculation at the top area is huge.];W[rj]LB[pj:a][qi:b][rk:c][oh:d]C[W98: It is obvious that Chang Hao has played abnormally due to pressure, as for experience in the world major events, Cho Hunhyun is a notch above Chang Hao. For White to hane at 'a' is out of the question, B 'b', W 'c' and B 'd', White instead will come under attack.];B[ri];W[qi];B[pj];W[rk];B[pe]LB[pf:a][qh:b][pi:c][oi:d][ph:e][pg:f][oh:g][of:h]C[B103: Black is very cunning, if W 'a', then B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f', W 'g' and B 'h' (see var a).]

;B[pi];W[mf];B[jg]LB[rg:a][pk:b][pl:c][ol:d]C[B109: Black has fixed his defect at the top, because Black can live with just one more at 'a', so Black on the right has no life and death problem; But the push and cut of B 'b', W 'c' and B 'd' is very severe since White has two weak stones in the lower right.];W[om];B[pf];W[qd];B[ni];W[pg];B[pk]

;B[qg];W[og];B[ng];W[of];B[mm]LB[jq:a]C[B113 is an overplay, Black should extend to 'a'.];W[oj];B[ll];W[oi];B[ph];W[oh];B[si]C[Through 139, Black ends up in gote, White can be satisfied.]
