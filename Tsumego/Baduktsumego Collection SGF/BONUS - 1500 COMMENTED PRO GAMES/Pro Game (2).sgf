;B[dp];W[po];B[md];W[oe];B[pf];W[ph]LB[kd:a][oh:b]C[W10 playing as the pincer move at 'a' is common, W10 at 'b' is also a favorite play of Cho Hunhyun.];B[of];W[ne];B[pc]LB[ng:a][me:b][kd:c]C[B13 is rarely seen, the usual sequence is B 'a', W 'b' and B 'c'.]

After W18, White has the tactic of pushing through at 'a' to fix his shape by sacrificing with the sequence W 'a', B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f', W 'g', B 'h', W 'i', B 'j', W 'k' and B 'l' (see var a).]

(;B[np];W[qq];B[qr];W[qp];B[or];W[no]LB[pe:a][oh:b][qk:c]C[W24 is a top-notch play of Cho Hunhyun, aiming to expand his moyo on the right side, now because White can push through at 'a', the maneuver of B 'b' attaching out is greatly restrained, Cho Hunhyun will not cooperate to extend at around 'c'.];B[mo];W[nn];B[op]TR[or]LB[mn:a][mm:b]C[The marked black stone is tiger reinforcing, so it looks like that B27 is superfluous, but if Black presses at 'a', then White will hane at 'b' strongly, Black has no good follow-up. Black aims to obtain sente then turn to other places.]
;W[pm];B[oh]TR[pm]LB[og:a][pg:b][ng:c][qh:d]C[After White strengthens with the marked stone, then B29 has no apprehensions to attach out, because now if White wedges at 'a', then B 'b', W 'c' and B 'd' ataris to grab territory, the marked stone appears cumbersome.];W[pi]C[W30 has no choice but to draw back.];B[ng]C[Black can stick his head out with B31 and should be very happy.];W[qf]C[W32 turns to acquire territory and it is White's deserved compensation, White has spent a lot of moves on the right side.];B[pe];W[pg]
;B[og];W[kc]LB[re:a][qb:b]C[W36 is a good move, White strengthens himself and also makes the diagonal move at 'a' become sente, when W 'a', if Black tenukis, after W 'b', Black will come under attack, and it is clear at a glance that  W 'a' also helps increase White's territory on the right side.
];B[fc]TR[kc]C[The approaching direction of B37 is certain, though White reinforces with the marked white stone, but White is still not completely stable.];W[ec];B[fd];W[df];B[ic];W[je]C[W42 is the mutual good point, strengthening himself and also attacking Black.];B[ld]LB[lc:a][lf:b][kd:c][he:d]C[B43 is ruthless, aiming at the sequence of W 'a', B 'b', W 'c' and B 'd', as a result White gets a bad shape.]
;W[lc];B[lf];W[id]LB[hc:a][jc:b][kd:c][gb:d]C[The hit of W46 is a tit-for-tat play, Cho Hunhyun definitely will not grant Chang Hao's wishes, if B 'a' retreats, then W 'b', White's shape is much better than the one that we discussed earlier; If B 'b', then W 'c', after the addition of W46, White has the maneuver of striking inside Black's territory at 'd'.];B[hd]C[B47 is the most intensive counter-attack.];W[jc];B[ie];W[jd]LB[hc:a][he:b]C[By forcing W50 to connect, Black must feel very happy, but Black is also troublesome with the two cutting points 'a' and 'b'.

;B[he];W[jg];B[ib];W[re]LB[mg:a][rd:b]C[W54 is an earlier preserved tactic, now W 'a' is a good point but this may help Black become thicker on the outside, then Black's diagonal move at 54 may not be sente any more. But will Black respond at 'b' docilely?];B[ki]LB[mg:a][mf:b][lg:c][kg:d]C[Black counteracts with B55, and also seems to defend White's hane at 'a', now if White hanes at 'a', then B 'b', W 'c' and B 'd' wedging is a good move, White is no good.];W[ih]LB[mg:a]C[After White diagonals with W56, the hane at 'a' works again, Black needs to reinforce.]
;B[kg];W[if]LB[kf:a][gg:b]C[W58 can defend the cut at 'a' with sente, but it also seems to strengthen Black, so professional players like Cho Hunhyun are generally reluctant to play the moves that only seek momentary gratification. But after W 'a', W 'b' attacking Black is very severe.];B[fg];W[ij];B[dg]LB[cg:a][ch:b][cf:c][dh:d][cc:e][eb:f][cd:g][ce:h][ba:i]C[The attachment of B61 is a good move, afterwards if W 'a', then B 'b' hanes, W 'c', B 'd' can seal off White, Black is left with the tactic of living in the corner with the sequence of B 'e', W 'f', B 'g', W 'h' and the excellent move B 'i' (see var a).

;W[be]C[Through 76, Black selects to fight by sacrificing. White practically grabs a big corner and has nothing to complain.

So far, it's time for noon break, to be continued at 1:30pm.];W[kj]C[W78 is a good move.];B[lj]LB[qb:a][rc:b]C[B79 has no choice, because Black has the tactic of striking at 'a' or jumping at 'b', Black is still not completely alive.]
;W[fi]LB[ci:a][gb:b]C[W80 is brutal and relentless, now for White to knight capture the two black stones is usual, W80 aims for higher efficiency, because of the defect at 'b', Black also has life and death problem.];B[gi]LB[gh:a][hh:b][hg:c][gg:d][fh:e][hf:f][ig:g][gk:h]C[B81 doubles up and sticks his head out, now White's direct hane and cut at 'a' doesn't work, B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f', W 'g' and B 'h' (see var a).]

(;B[gk];W[gl];B[fk]LB[hm:a][bf:b][ci:c][cj:d][hl:e][il:f][im:g][in:h]C[B101 and B103 are very tight, now if White defends the cut at 'a', then after B 'b' ataris, B 'c' jumps out (see var a); if White reinforces at 'd', then B 'e' cuts, followed by W 'f', B 'a', W 'g' and B 'h' (see var b), White's big dragon will also suffer dearly.]

;W[qk];B[pl];W[ql]C[W130 and W132 are plays under favorable situations.
