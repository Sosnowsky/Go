;B[pl];W[lp]C[W8: Today Choi Cheolhan plays very fast, apparently he has well prepared.];B[po];W[iq];B[cf]LB[qp:a]C[B11: For Black to strengthen at 'a' is also fine, the play in the game is active.];W[dh];B[ef];W[fd];B[dk];W[cm];B[fh]C[Through the cap of B17, it seems Black can fight.]
;W[ce];B[bf];W[cj]C[W18 and W20 are intense. Now it forms a fierce fight.];B[ck]LB[dj:a]C[B21: Black can also consider to make compromise by playing at 'a', but today Chang Hao is very strong and unyielding.];W[dj];B[ek];W[bk];B[bl];W[bj]LB[fi:a][ei:b]C[W24 and W26 are inevitable, if White simply attaches out at 'a', Black will hane at 'b'.]
;B[do];W[fi];B[co];W[bm];B[gi];W[fj];B[bo]C[B33: For Black to strengthen at 'a' is better.]LB[gf:a];W[gf]C[The sequence up to W34 is almost one-way street, now Black already obtains the corner territory, the key now is how to handle the top side.];B[ge];W[fe];B[ff]
;W[gg];B[gh];W[he];B[eh]C[Black's sequence from B35 to B41 is all forcing moves.];W[fk]LB[em:a]C[Comment by Teacher Nie Weiping 9p: W42 is the losing move, White should jump to 'a', Black can's save his four stones on the left side, and B35 is a very damaging move, overall this way Black basically is hard to win this game.];B[dm];W[em]C[W44 is good feeling.];B[en]C[B43 and B45 are strong moves.];W[dl]LB[ii:a]C[W46: White can consider to first cap at 'a' to create ko threats.]
;B[el];W[dn];B[fm]C[Now the situation is very complicated. White faces choice.

After this move, it is time for noon break.

Chang Hao has 2 hour and 9 minutes left (3 hours regular time for each player).
Choi Cheolhan has 1 hour and 51 minutes left.];W[fn]C[W50 is the only move.];B[dm];W[dg];B[df];W[em];B[eo];W[fl];B[dm];W[ii]C[The sequence up to B58 is inevitable, it seems Black is very painful.]
;B[cc];W[cd];B[ed]C[B59 and B61 is the strongest resistance.];W[ee];B[hj];W[em];B[ec];W[dc]LB[de:a]C[W66 is a surprising move, if White plays at 'a', Black will be in a bitter battle. In the game, because White breaks away from the main battle field, the situation is still chaotic.];B[dm];W[qp];B[cl]
;W[gm];B[hl];W[em];B[db];W[de];B[fm];W[hm];B[pp];W[em];B[jk]C[Through B79, Black completely breaks way from the passive situation in the ko fight, but the situation is still chaotic.

];W[qq]C[W80: White first takes territory in sente, it is very big, looking back, with B33, for Black to strengthen himself at 34 is the right move.
];B[qn]
;W[rn];B[qm];W[rm];B[rl];W[dl];B[fc]C[After White takes the ko with W86, the counterattack of B87 is simple and clear.];W[gc];B[gb];W[cb];B[hc];W[gd];B[kc]C[B89, B91 and B93 are very big moves. Because White has spent so many moves on the left side, Black easily turns his body around, now the game turns into a prolonged war.]
;W[qk];B[ql];W[qf];B[qe];W[pf];B[nd];W[pi]LB[nc:a]C[Looking back, with W86 White can consider to approach at 'a'. In the game, White wants to take advantage in sente, but it is White's wishful thinking, Black turns his body around alertly. Now Black has more territory, it seems Black is relatively easier to control.];B[dm];W[qc];B[re];W[oc]C[Both sides feel very weird about the ko on the left side. White goes crazy to grab territory with W102 and W104.]
;B[od];W[nc];B[mc];W[mb];B[lb];W[md];B[lc];W[rb];B[me];W[nj]C[Due to the ko on the left side, the situation is still hard to judge.];B[jm];W[jn];B[kn]
;W[im]C[W116 and W118: White is very painful.];B[jo]C[B119 is strong.];W[jl];B[in];W[il];B[ji];W[kl];B[qr];W[rr];B[pr];W[rs];B[jq]C[Through B129, Black's profit at the bottom is huge. Now we can say Black establishes his superiority.]
;W[mn];B[jh];W[on];B[pn]C[Now Black's problem is how to safely proceed.];W[jp];B[kp];W[kq]C[W134 and W136 making a ko are brilliant, keeping the situation chaotic. Because Black has many choices, I think Black will consider this local variation carefully. Because other places on the board are already very small. Only if Black can play the best answer, Black will win the game.];B[ip];W[jr];B[lq]LB[lo:a]C[B139 starts the ko immediately, it is not the strongest answer, to play at 'a' is better.];W[jp]
;B[sp];W[ko];B[ro]C[In the exchange, White takes a little advantage.];W[ib]C[W144 is a prepared tactic earlier on.];B[lo];W[kp];B[nb];W[ob];B[ma];W[oa]C[At 16:10, Chang Hao's left time is 55 minutes, Choi's left time is 30 minutes.];B[hb];W[ic]
;B[fb]LB[ea:a][id:b][hd:c][jc:d]C[B153 is the strongest answer, because after the exchange at the bottom, White becomes thick across the board, the situation is again a little chaotic.

Now White can play at 'a', then B 'b', W 'c' and B 'd', White can try to kill Black's big dragon in the center by borrowing strength from the top, but not sure this way whether White has assurance of success in killing.];W[ij]C[At 16:50, Chang Hao already incurs two-point penalty, Choi Cheolhan still has 30 minutes left. According to Ing rules, after using up all regular times (3 hours per player), there will be two-point penalty for every 35 minutes.];B[ih];W[ea];B[id];W[hd];B[ia]LB[jc:a]C[Black makes compromise, not sure why Black doesn't play at 'a'.]
;W[ik];B[hg];W[jd];B[jb];W[ie];B[kf];W[eb]C[Now the game enters the situation where endgame play will decide the game.];B[nh];W[nf];B[mf];W[ng];B[mh];W[oh]
;B[fm];W[fq];B[fp];W[gq];B[er];W[gp]C[White's endgame at the top is questionable, White didn't take any advantage. But because Black clearly incurs loss in the exchange at the bottom, plus two-point penalty. Now White is slightly favorable in the game.];B[fo]C[Now the key is still to see how the shape will be settled on the left side.];W[gn];B[al];W[mq]C[It seems White already thinks he will win the game.];B[ml];W[mm]
;B[nm];W[nn];B[om];W[ll]LB[mk:a]C[The situation is very subtle, with W188 White can consider to make the diagonal extension at 'a'.];B[qh];W[mg];B[lg];W[nl];B[hs];W[em];B[cn];W[ke]
;B[le];W[pk];B[ok];W[rk];B[sk];W[sj];B[sl];W[ri];B[rg];W[rf];B[sf];W[oj];B[ac]
;W[bc];B[nr];W[li];B[lh];W[rh];B[qg];W[sh];B[sg];W[fr];B[fs];W[gs]LB[mr:a]C[W220 is a very obvious bad move, if White plays at 'a', White wins the game for sure.];B[gr]

Chang Hao wins the champion by 3:1!])
