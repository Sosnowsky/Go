;W[ed];B[oc];W[df];B[cg];W[dh]C[The knight press of W8 and the cap of W10 are new trend.];B[ch]LB[dg:a][eg:b][eh:c][cc:d][bh:e]C[B11: If Black elects to play B 'a', next W 'b' and B 'c', since White has the strong block at 11, the fight is not to Black's advantage. But the crawl of B11 in the real game fits White's purpose very well, it is perhaps better for Black to attach at 'd' or make diagonal at 'e'.];W[di];B[ci]
;W[dj];B[cj];W[dk];B[jc];W[ck]C[From the extension of W12 to the turn of W18, White becomes thick on the board.];B[fq];W[qi];B[qn]LB[pj:a]C[B21 is a questionable move, Black should play shoulder hit at 'a' to reduce White's thickness on the left side, this is just the play to keep balance for the whole situation.];W[ql]C[After White pincers with W22, Black is passive.];B[nq];W[np]
;B[mp];W[no];B[pq];W[qq];B[oq];W[qp];B[lq];W[bc]C[W32 is a good move to settle the shape.];B[bf]LB[bd:a][cd:b]C[The shape of B33 is loose, but Black seems to have no choice, if Black makes small diagonal at 'a', White will squeeze at 'b', Black will be more exploited due to eye shape problem.];W[qf]
;B[pm]C[B35: If Black doesn't play like this, Black is difficult to keep balance in territory with White, but White on the back of left-side thickness is not fearful of fight, we can only say Black's opening is not successful.];W[pl];B[om]LB[nm:a]C[B37: For Black to jump at 'a' is more light and nimble.];W[mo];B[mm];W[kp];B[ln];W[lo];B[jr];W[jn];B[nk]
;W[iq]C[After White takes consecutive good points with W40, W42 and W46, White is in a very good tempo.];B[jq];W[ip];B[jm];W[im];B[kn];W[jp];B[in];W[hn];B[jo];W[il];B[jl];W[ik]
;B[gc]LB[bp:a]C[The two-space extension of B59 is the losing move, now Black should jump to 'a' to ensue the corner safety, which is imperative.];W[mr];B[lr];W[pr];B[or];W[ps]C[W60, W62 and W64 are all local beautiful tesujis.];B[os];W[rr];B[lp];W[ir];B[op]
;W[oo];B[ms];W[cq]C[The strike of W72 is severe, White not only takes away the corner territory and also threatens Black's base.];B[cp];W[dq];B[eq];W[bp];B[bo];W[bq];B[ho];W[io];B[gn];W[jn]
;B[cn];W[dr];B[in];W[hm];B[go];W[ko];B[jn];W[pn];B[qm];W[en]C[W92 again is a strong move.];B[em];W[fm];B[fn]
;W[dm];B[eo];W[el]C[Through W98, White takes one stone, Black's situation has further deteriorated.];B[gr];W[rp];B[oe];W[ke];B[je]LB[ld:a][le:b][id:c]C[B103: Black can only fight desperately like this, if Black protects territory at 'a', White can press at 'b' in sente then make the knight's move at 'c', the center will become White's territory.];W[jf]
;B[kf];W[le];B[jd];W[of];B[nf];W[kg]C[White first attaches with W108, then plays atari with W110, it is good order, as a result, the key stone of B105 is captured.];B[pf];W[qg];B[if]LB[lf:a][mf:b][lg:c][ng:d]C[B113: If Black escapes at 'a', then W 'b', B 'c' and W 'd', B109 will be taken.]
;W[lf];B[jh];W[ki];B[ph];W[pi];B[oi];W[oj];B[ni];W[pg];B[og];W[jg];B[ig];W[ih]C[After White strengthens the center with W124 and W126, Black already has no chance to win.]
