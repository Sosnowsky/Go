;W[dp];B[db];W[od];B[oc];W[pd];B[pc];W[qe]C[The high jump of W4 and the avalanche play of W10 and W12 are all often used by Qiu Jun.];B[nc];W[nd]C[As far as I know, he has studied very deeply as to this local variation.];B[md];W[qc];B[rd]

;B[ld];W[of];B[kd];W[jc];B[jd];W[hc]LB[ic:a][id:b][gb:c]C[W36: For White to simply extend at 'a' is better. If Black presses at 'b', White can make knight at 'c'.];B[id];W[ic];B[ma];W[ka]
;B[ge];W[fb];B[ec];W[gd];B[ee];W[he]LB[gc:a]C[The play of W44 and W46 is far-fetched, to bump at 'a' is the right move.];B[gf];W[cc]LB[hd:a]C[The diagonal of W48 is unreasonable. Although it is inconvenient, White can only connect at 'a'.];B[de]C[B49 is good move to fight by sacrificing!]

;B[bi];W[ag];B[eg];W[eh];B[fg];W[dg];B[ci];W[ch];B[jb];W[ib];B[jf]C[Through B73, White's big group is very dangerous.];W[ig]LB[hf:a][fi:b]C[W74: If White attaches at 'a', Black can jump to 'b'. White can't tolerate being tighten liberties by Black.]
;B[hf];W[if];B[ie];W[gc];B[fa];W[ha];B[eb];W[oa];B[pa];W[ga];B[fi]LB[ja:a][gi:b]C[B85 is good move! If Black destroys eye at 'a' right away, after W 'b', Black itself is also dangerous.]
;W[na];B[ob];W[fh];B[gh];W[gi];B[hh];W[ej]C[W92: If being sealed off by Black, White has to make life in gote, so White can only stick head out first.];B[ja]C[But after Black destroys eye with B93, White already sinks into a difficult situation.];W[na];B[ra];W[ih];B[kg]C[However, since this is 30-second-per-move fast game, the situation changes very quickly. In just a few moves, the situation has been completely turned around.]
;W[kh];B[lh]LB[hi:a][ii:b]C[First, with B99 Black should turn out at 'a' or play hane at 'b', White has no follow-up tactic.];W[lg];B[lf]LB[mg:a]C[And with B101 Black should play atari at 'a'.];W[mg];B[jh];W[ji]C[In the real game, it just helps White to play the sente move of W104.];B[ki];W[hg]
;B[cb];W[bb];B[ba];W[bc];B[gg];W[hi]C[W112: White seals off Black, the situation is already not clear.];B[fj];W[ei];B[jj];W[ii];B[hk];W[ij];B[ik]
;W[gj];B[da]LB[aa:a][ca:b]C[Black's most fatal mistake is making eye with B121. Zhou Ruiyang perhaps overlooks White's throw-in at 'a', this way White takes advantage of at least two liberties. With B121 Black should connect at 'b', this way it is basically a ko fight. Black can capture the right side. Although we can't say Black will be favorable, Black at least can continue the game.];W[sb];B[qa];W[kj];B[jk];W[fk];B[lj];W[aa];B[ab];W[ac]
;B[pi]LB[ad:a]C[B131: Black should immediately make diagonal at 'a' to fight the ko, then use B131 as ko threats, this way the situation will be more complicated.];W[qh];B[qi];W[ph];B[oi];W[mf];B[sc]LB[ad:a]C[B137 is the last losing move! Black still should play at 'a'.];W[me]C[After White bumps with W138, Black's ko threats are definitely not enough.];B[fb]
;W[hb]C[And, surprisingly White directly takes Black's big group.];B[sa];W[ed];B[fd];W[ff];B[ad];W[aa];B[oh];W[ca];B[og];W[pg];B[ba];W[rg]

;B[mi];W[aa];B[dq];W[ca]C[Through W182, the game is basically over.];B[ep];W[ea];B[do];W[nq];B[lq];W[pp];B[qq];W[lp];B[mq]
