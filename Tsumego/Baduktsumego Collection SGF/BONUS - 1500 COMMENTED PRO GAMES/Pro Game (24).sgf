Copyright by gogameworld.com and weiqi.tom.com.];B[pd];W[dd]C[Due to the big komi (7.5), both sides more likely want to take White.];B[qp]C[However, Chang Hao's opening while taking Black is relatively strong among Chinese players.];W[dp];B[fq]
;W[cn];B[op]C[Black's opening of B1 to B7 is common.];W[jp]C[The sequence following W8 is inevitable from both sides.];B[lq];W[eq];B[fp];W[hp];B[fm]C[In the process, with B13, Black can also make small jump at 'a'.]LB[fn:a];W[dm]C[Black's speed is fast, but White is left with the good point of W14.];B[hm]C[B15: Black appears well prepared, B15 is just right.]
;W[jm];B[iq]C[The peep of B17 is severe.];W[jq]LB[mq:a];B[in];W[lp];B[mq];W[jn];B[ip];W[ir];B[io];W[hr];B[er]
;W[dr];B[hq];W[fr];B[gr];W[es];B[gs];W[mm]C[Through W34, the local variation comes to an end. White's corner territory is bigger than Black's, but White's corner is a little thin. At a glance, Black's shape is smooth, but White sticks head out smoothly and White's shape is resilient. I think Black only takes a little profit.];B[om]C[B35: Black encloses territory by threatening White's weak group, White is difficult.];W[rp];B[qq];W[qi]C[W36 and W38: White tries to keep balance in territory.];B[qg]LB[ln:a]C[B39: Black clearly should first strike at 'a' to pound White's thin shape, then settle the shape on the right side.]
;W[ql];B[ok]C[B39 and B41 are severely damaging to territory. Afterwards, White's answer can be light and nimble in the center. Therefore these two moves are not sharp enough.];W[qn];B[lk];W[il];B[ij];W[hk];B[fk]C[Black gains very little in the attack with B43 to B47, very difficult to see what Black can achieve.];W[hj];B[fi]C[Black's shape in the attack is not good, however White still sticks head out smoothly.];W[ii];B[fc]
;W[cf];B[jd]C[Black loses attacking target and turns to take big points.];W[pc];B[qc];W[oc]C[White elects to settle the shape simply with W54 and W56. White's situation is a little better.];B[qb];W[od];B[pe];W[lc];B[kb];W[kc];B[jc]
;W[lb];B[jb];W[lf];B[kg]C[If proceeding normally, Black's situation is not good, so Black separates White first and tries to take advantage. However, for now White's big groups are not dangerous.];W[kf];B[jf]C[B69 is strong and unyielding.];W[jg]C[But being cut by W70, Black doesn't seem to have any effective follow-up tactic.

After this move, it is time for noon break.];B[lg]C[B71 is played after long meditation.];W[je]C[However, after White pushes, Black has no follow-up tactic. So far, if White's two groups are settled, Black's territory is clearly inadequate.];B[if];W[ie]
;B[hf]C[Therefore, the fight in the center will be the key for the game.];W[he]LB[jh:a][kd:b]C[W76: For White to play at 'a' is also possible. After careful study, we think the play of W76 is unnecessary. If White simply makes life at 'b', White's situation is not bad.];B[kd]C[B77 is severe, the situation instantly becomes chaotic.];W[gf];B[jh];W[ig]LB[ke:a]C[W80: White has no assurance of success, since White cuts his way back first. Originally White can consider to simply connect at 'a'.];B[hg];W[ih]
;B[gg];W[ke];B[ld];W[mg]LB[me:a]C[W86: I feel for White to play at 'a' is perhaps better.];B[li];W[me];B[md];W[oe];B[jj]C[Black takes the vital point with B91, White's situation is severe. The root cause is W76, which is too strong.];W[fh]C[The purpose of W92 is to turn body around first and then make life at bottom.];B[ff]LB[gi:a][gh:b]C[If B93 at 'a', White can play at 'b', Black is not good.]
;W[gi]C[Now the situation is chaotic, Black's big group at bottom is not alive completely either.];B[ge]C[Overall, Black successfully leads the game to a cathodic situation.];W[pf];B[qf];W[mj]C[W98, first probing Black, is good order.];B[mk];W[hc]LB[hb:a][gc:b]C[W100 is early hidden tactic. If Black attaches over at 'a', White can play at 'b'.];B[df]C[B101: Since Black can't connect back right away, Black elects to fight indirectly.];W[fj]LB[gl:a]C[W102: White also doesn't reinforce itself. Later on if White becomes thick, White can peep at 'a' and kill Black's big group at bottom unconditionally.]
;B[de]LB[hb:a]C[B103: Black first makes the left side thick to prepare for killing White's big group, but White has the sente move at 'a', Black couldn't kill strongly.];W[ce];B[cd];W[cc];B[bd];W[bc];B[dc];W[ed];B[ec];W[be];B[fd];W[ad]
;B[pg]C[B115 is bad move.];W[nh]LB[nj:a]C[Now Black is very difficult. The right move is to strengthen at 'a', but this way Black in the upper left corner will be get killed.];B[nj];W[oi];B[pj];W[pi]C[W118 and W120 are steady moves. White's purpose is to kill Black in the upper left corner.];B[qj];W[nl]C[W122, asking Black, is good timing.];B[nk]C[W123: Black has no other choice. Generally speaking, Black is already very difficult to play. Since in the upper left corner, White at least can ko-kill Black. This way White can play two consecutive moves somewhere else, Black is not good.];W[hb]
;B[nb];W[ee]C[W124 and W126 are early planned tactic.];B[ef];W[ga]LB[dh:a][gb:b][cb:c]C[But W128 is a surprising move. In fact, if White makes knight at 'a' to initiate the ko fight, it is already very simple and clear. The variation is W128 at 'a', then B 'b' and W 'c'. W128 is a clever move locally, Black can't answer again, otherwise Black will be captured.];B[dh]C[Basically White all live cleanly, then start to attack Black at bottom.];W[ob];B[na];W[ji];B[ki]
;W[kh];B[lh];W[db];B[ei];W[ej];B[gh];W[gl]C[W140: Black is very miserable. Locally Black is dead, but White is not very thick on the outside and can't easily kill Black.];B[ln]C[W141, first striking then making life, is the strongest move.];W[jo];B[gm];W[ol]LB[di:a]C[W144 is a careless move. White clearly should first play atari at 'a'.]
;B[dj];W[ek];B[dk]C[B145 and B147 are good moves.];W[el];B[kr];W[jr]C[White is no longer favorable in territory.];B[eo];W[mp];B[np]LB[ri:a]C[B153: I feel for Black to make life at 'a' is good enough, the play in the game is more relentless. However after study, if Gu Li (White) plays endgame correctly, White will win the game slightly. Therefore B153 is smaller than B 'a'.];W[rj]C[White's sequence starting from W128 is not accurate, now Black is slightly leading in territory.]

;B[lo];W[kl];B[ll];W[ci];B[di];W[bj];B[bk]C[Now White is a little favorable, about half point to one-and-half point.];W[bm];B[qk];W[rk];B[pl];W[on];B[do]
;W[co];B[fl];W[pk];B[eb];W[ea];B[pl];W[of]C[The endgame proceeds normally, but Black failed to play the sente move of W200, I think White wins for sure.];B[rl];W[pk]C[Now it seems B153 is the only chance to turn the game around.];B[cb];W[da];B[pl]

;B[aj];W[bh];B[bg];W[cg];B[ah]C[B221 and B223: Black fights very ferociously. If White fights the ko, Black can't win the ko fight. But if White retreats, the situation is not clear.];W[ch];B[ai]C[Black takes 2-point advantage.];W[mi];B[kk];W[kp];B[no];W[sp]
