;B[op];W[po];B[pq];W[qq];B[oo];W[fg];B[oq];W[eh]C[White takes one stone with W40, White becomes very thick and already can be satisfied.];B[pn];W[qn];B[qm];W[rn]LB[ro:a]C[The descent of W44 is a good move and better than hanging at 'a'.]

;W[jq]C[W48 and W58: White breaks up the situation at the bottom and effectively negates Black's thickness in the lower-right corner.];B[el];W[od]C[The high approach of W60 also serves as ladder breaker.];B[md]LB[oc:a]C[But after Black counterattacks with B61, White has no follow-up tactic to place ladder breaker. So with W60 for White to approach low at 'a' is perhaps better.];W[lq];B[pf];W[on]C[After one-space extension of W62, the cut of W64 again is correlated, White elects an intense play.];B[mq]LB[nm:a]C[B65: For Black to play at 'a' and sacrifice four stones at the bottom is also playable. Since White is too thick in the upper left corner, Black perhaps doesn't want to take influence.]
;W[om];B[ol];W[mn];B[lp];W[pl];B[kq]C[B71: Black captures one stone in sente and obtains a big profit.];W[jp];B[ql];W[pk];B[qk];W[pj];B[qj];W[pi]
;B[qi];W[ph];B[qh]C[Therefore Black can tolerate by crawling on the third line from B73 to B81.];W[lr]C[W82: White has some other motives.];B[mm]LB[kr:a][kp:b][mr:c][lo:d][pg:e][qg:f][of:g]C[B83: If Black blocks at 'a', next W 'b', B 'c' and W 'd' in sente, then White can bump at 'e' and play hane at 'f', this way White will be certainly very happy.

So following B83 Black counterattacks and gets to bump at 'e', which is inevitable.];W[nl]

;W[kc]C[White's sequence from W94 to W98 is a common tactic to dodge.];B[jd];W[mc]C[W100 is a mistake.];B[pd]C[After Black connects with B101 in sente, White incurs loss.];W[ld];B[gr];W[fq];B[eq];W[fr];B[cm];W[cr];B[bq]
;W[cq];B[bn];W[br];B[lj];W[mi];B[io];W[jo];B[in];W[go];B[cs]C[B119 is an asking move.];W[jn];B[fs];W[hm]C[White counterattacks hastily with W120 and W122, this is the direct reason for White's defeat.]
;B[hl]LB[im:a]C[The attachment of B123 serves two purposes, it prevents W52 from escaping and also connects back two stones at 'a', it is the winning move of this game.];W[nn];B[mp];W[ll]C[White starts to fight following W126, it is a little far-fetched.];B[im];W[il];B[jm];W[km];B[kl];W[kn];B[qr]

Now if White plays atari at 'a' and makes life the lower-left corner, Black will hang at 178, White has to play atari at 'b' (otherwise B 'c', W 'b' and B 'd', initiating a ko), Black will definitely win the game.];B[bo]C[After Black simply captures White's corner with B179, the game is over.

The final game 2 will take place on 2/1 to 2/2.])
