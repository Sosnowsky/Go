;B[op]LB[ql:a][lq:b]C[B7: If Black pincers at around 'a', White probably will counter-pincer at 'b'.];W[ql];B[dn];W[do];B[eo];W[ep]LB[cn:a]C[W10 and W12 are rarely seen, normally with W10 White will attach out at 12, or with W12 White plays hane at 'a', these are common josekis.];B[fp];W[dp];B[en]

;B[ef];W[ic];B[bo]LB[on:a]C[After the exchange of B25 and W26, with B31 Black should jump to 'a', which is an excellent point. If Black plans to make the knight's move at 31, the exchange of B25 and W26 should be reserved.];W[gr];B[iq];W[nn]C[Through W34, White is successful in the opening.];B[ec];W[ed];B[cc];W[cd];B[dc]
;W[fc];B[bd];W[be];B[bc];W[bf]C[The crawl of W44 is the right move. If White simply connects at 46, Black will clamp at 44, White is not comfortable.];B[ch];W[ce];B[nc];W[eb];B[db];W[fb];B[ba];W[qf]
;B[qe];W[pf];B[qh];W[cj]LB[cn:a][bh:b][rf:c]C[The invasion of W56 is not big, White can hane out at 'a' and also can attach at 'b', Black's left-side territory is very small, White still should handle W52 and W54, for example, playing descent at 'c'.];B[ei];W[ek];B[bp];W[bq];B[br]C[B59 and B61: Black is alert.]
;W[cr];B[bm]LB[aq:a]C[But with B63 Black should play atari at 'a', it is very big, till the end here is always the key for the game.];W[bl];B[cl];W[ck];B[dl];W[ej];B[gi];W[dh];B[di];W[bh]C[White crosses over with W72, White ends in gote and White's gain is limited.]
;B[ni];W[mf];B[rf]LB[nf:a][og:b]C[Black's attack with B73 and B75 is over carefree, Black should attack more positively, such as, playing cap at 'a' or 'b'.];W[ii]C[W76: White takes tenuki to first cap Black, playing offensively in order to defend.];B[kc]C[Black's feeling of B77 is not good, Black simply takes tenuki and grab territory.];W[ld];B[lc];W[md];B[mc];W[od]
;B[oc];W[gj]C[With the sequence following W78, White takes advantage in sente, then attaches with W84, Black is not good.];B[ig];W[gg];B[gf];W[hf];B[hi];W[hj];B[hg];W[ff];B[ge];W[fg];B[gh]
;W[he];B[ie];W[hd];B[kg];W[jf];B[jg];W[mh];B[ki];W[mi];B[qg];W[mp]C[White captures two stones, obtaining a big profit, the most important is that the knight's move of W106 is huge.];B[or]LB[mq:a][lq:b][nq:c][rr:d][aq:e]C[B107 is too slow! Black certainly should directly attach at 'a', next W 'b', B 'c', if W 'd', Black is unnecessary to hang at 107, instead Black can atari at 'e'.]
;W[rr]C[White gets to atari first with W108, Black's territory is already not optimistic.];B[rs];W[sq];B[mq];W[lq];B[nq];W[re];B[rd];W[ci];B[eh];W[if];B[lj];W[ji]
;B[lh]LB[mj:a][kh:b][jj:c][ij:d]C[B121 is the last losing move! Black should block at 'a', if White's wedge at 'b' worries Black, Black can first exchange B 'c' and W 'd', this way perhaps Black still can continue.];W[mj];B[jk];W[kj]C[White pushes with W122, next the squeeze of W124 is a brilliant move! Black collapses.];B[jj];W[kk];B[ij];W[jl];B[ik]
