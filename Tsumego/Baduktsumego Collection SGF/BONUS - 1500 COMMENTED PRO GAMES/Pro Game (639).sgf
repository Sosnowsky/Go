;B[re];W[rc];B[qe];W[nc];B[np];W[mq]C[The opening is not conventional.];B[lp]LB[lo:a][kp:b][ko:c][jp:d][pj:e]C[The jump of B25 is not good, Black should make knight at 'a', next W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', then B 'e' is an excellent point, this is clearly better than the real game.];W[lq]LB[kp:a][kq:b][jp:c][jq:d][ip:e][pi:f]C[With B27, if Black still make extension at 'a', next W 'b', B 'c' and W 'd', when B 'e', White can take tenuki and make shoulder-hit at 'f', Black's thickness can't be used.]
;B[iq]C[B27 is emergency move I thought out at the game time.];W[ip];B[jq];W[mp];B[hr];W[hp];B[gq];W[jp]LB[mo:a]C[W34: White should stick head out at 'a'.];B[dr]C[The exchange of W34 and B35 is damaging to White.];W[ci]LB[mo:a]C[W36: White still should extend out at 'a'.]
;B[mo]C[B37: Black seals off the head and White is not comfortable.];W[qq]LB[lo:a]C[W38 is miscalculation, White can only play atari at 'a'.];B[nq];W[nr];B[or]C[White overlooks Black's tactic of B39 and B41.];W[lr];B[ns];W[mr]C[The exchange of B43 and W44 is not good.];B[pq];W[op]
;B[no];W[pr];B[pp];W[os];B[qr]C[Through B51, White incurs loss.];W[jr];B[ir];W[kq]TR[ns][mr]LB[js:a][ks:b]C[It is better for Black not to exchange B43 and W44 (the marked stones). This way White can no longer play W52 and W54, since once Black plays atari at 'a', White can't fight the ko at 'b'. In the game, White has W44, the ko becomes lighter for White.];B[db]
;W[ec];B[eb];W[cd];B[bc]LB[dd:a]C[B59: Black should cut at 'a'. In the game, Black's playing direction is questionable.];W[cq];B[js];W[qj];B[ql];W[dd];B[fc];W[fd];B[gc]
;W[ce];B[gd]TR[nc]C[Through B69, The jump of W22 (the marked stone) looks very shinning.];W[ks];B[kr];W[bb];B[ls]LB[cb:a][jr:b][oj:c][is:d][cr:e]C[B73 is one of my very regrettable moves. This ko is not bigger as imagined, White already becomes very thick, capturing several stones including B27 is not big. With B73 Black still should answer the ko at 'a', next W 'b', B 'c', W 'd' and B 'e', this variation is better than the real game.];W[oo]C[W74 is good move, Black is not sure what to do.]
;B[on]LB[cb:a]C[Since there is a big move at 'a', both sides want to grab sente.];W[or];B[nm];W[rq];B[rr];W[rp];B[ro];W[pn];B[qo];W[lo];B[ln];W[ko]
;B[cb]C[Black is able to connect with B87, but Black's aji is very bad.];W[om];B[nn];W[pm];B[qm];W[nl];B[mm]C[After W92, Black can only turn very painfully with B93.];W[ok];B[lk];W[rf];B[pf];W[pg]
;B[qg];W[of];B[sf];W[pe];B[rg];W[oi]LB[mi:a][cg:b]C[W104: White should make knight at 'a', this way White most likely can grab sente and strengthen the invasion defect at 'b'.];B[li];W[nd]C[The play of W106 is damaging to territory, and also it allows Black to make life.];B[oe];W[ne]
;B[pf];W[kj];B[lj];W[ng]C[White's sequence of W104 to W112 is too slow, turning a good situation into passivity.];B[cg]C[The invasion of B113 is the last big point on the board.];W[dg]C[W114: White has no other choice but to sacrifice.];B[dh];W[ch];B[df];W[eg];B[cf];W[ei]
;B[ff];W[fg];B[jl];W[jc]LB[km:a]C[The extension of W124 is big, but White wants to attack Black at 'a'.];B[ij];W[jh];B[kn];W[ik];B[jk];W[hk];B[jo];W[kp]

;B[dk];W[fk];B[ej];W[fj];B[cl];W[dn];B[el];W[fo]LB[dj:a]C[W152 is the last game-deciding move. If White strengthens at 'a', White's territory is clearly inadequate.];B[di];W[bk];B[bl];W[bg]
