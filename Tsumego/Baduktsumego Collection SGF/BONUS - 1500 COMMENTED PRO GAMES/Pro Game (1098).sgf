;B[kc];W[qj];B[ql];W[qg];B[pf]C[The play of B9 and B11 was very popular several years ago.];W[re];B[rd]LB[rf:a]C[B13: Black can also crosscut at 'a'.];W[pg];B[og];W[of]C[The past conclusion is, after the cut of W16, the fight is slightly to White's advantage.];B[qf]
;W[rf];B[od];W[nf];B[oh];W[pi];B[nj]LB[mh:a][oi:b][ri:c]C[The knight of B23 is too loose! It doesn't give White any pressure, Black should jump to 'a' or press at 'b', next to strike at 'c' is happy.];W[ld]LB[lc:a][nd:b][nc:c][oc:d]C[The shoulder-hit of W24 is good move! If Black crawls at 'a', next W 'b', B 'c', then the cut of W 'd' is severe.]
;B[me]TR[of][nf]C[Black pierces through with B25, the two marked white stones are very light.];W[lc];B[jd];W[je];B[ie];W[ke];B[id];W[mf];B[nc];W[jg]C[Through W34, White is successful.];B[mh]
;W[pl];B[ri]LB[qm:a][qk:b]C[The strike of B37 is good and smooth move! If Black retreats at 'a', White will bump at 'b' and form a good shape.];W[rj];B[qm];W[pk];B[nl];W[pm];B[qn];W[pn];B[qp];W[nn]
;B[mq];W[mk]LB[co:a]C[The play of W46 and W48 is questionable, if White wants to strike at 48, White shouldn't exchange W46 and B47. And if White already did the exchange, White shouldn't strike at 48 and should defend at 'a', which is the big point.];B[ml];W[nk];B[lk];W[mj];B[lj];W[ni]C[White takes one stone with W54, which is somewhat tasteless.];B[mg];W[nd];B[ln]
;W[np];B[nq];W[lo];B[kn];W[lq];B[lr];W[lp];B[kr];W[op];B[oq]C[The gain and loss is not clear with the exchange from W58 to B67.];W[eb];B[fb];W[ec]LB[co:a]C[W70: White can consider to defend the corner at 'a'.]
;B[co];W[dl];B[ep];W[dp];B[do];W[eo];B[dm];W[fo];B[el]LB[em:a][cl:b]C[B79: For Black to extend at 'a' is more solid, next W 'b' and B79, this way Black can echo his stones in the center. In the real game, Black perhaps becomes thin in the center.];W[dk];B[en]
;W[ek];B[fq];W[gq];B[eq];W[bp];B[bo];W[dr];B[gr];W[fl];B[fn];W[go];B[gn];W[ho]
;B[hq];W[iq]LB[hn:a]C[W96: White should turn at 'a', to separate Black is imperative.];B[cp];W[cq];B[im]C[The knight of B99 is good move.];W[hr];B[gp];W[hp];B[ir]C[Black is not fearful of fighting ko at the bottom.];W[gq];B[rg]
;W[rh];B[hq];W[br]C[Since there are no proper ko threats, White has to give up ko fight unconditionally.];B[hs]C[Black gains.];W[jo];B[ap];W[bq];B[bl];W[bk];B[cl];W[ck];B[fe]
;W[jk];B[mi];W[oj];B[jn];W[oe];B[pd];W[nb];B[oc];W[li]LB[eg:a]C[The cut of W126 is losing move! if White makes knight at 'a', it is still a very long and close game.];B[ki];W[lh];B[lf]
;W[kh];B[le];W[lg];B[jh];W[kg];B[md];W[nh];B[kd]C[White clearly incurs loss with the exchange from B127 to B137.];W[fa];B[em];W[hl];B[hm];W[al]
