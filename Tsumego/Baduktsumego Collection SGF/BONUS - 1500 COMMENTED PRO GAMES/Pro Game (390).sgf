;W[hc];B[cf];W[fd];B[cc]C[B7 and B9 are often seen recently.];W[cd];B[dc];W[ed];B[ec]LB[fb:a]C[B13: Black can also descend at 'a'. Black obtains some territory and White is very thick.];W[bd];B[gc];W[gd]
;B[hb];W[ic];B[ib];W[jc];B[cj];W[ch];B[cn];W[fq];B[bp];W[iq]LB[cl:a][en:b][dk:c][cq:d][dj:e]C[W26: For Black to invade at 'a' immediately seems a little unreasonable, Black can jump to 'b', next W 'c', B 'd', W26 and B 'e', Black appears far-fetched.]
;B[ei]LB[ej:a]C[B27: For Black to jump at 'a' is common, the play in the real game is to seek high efficiency, but it also takes some risk.];W[cl]LB[dj:a]C[The invasion of W28 is positive. Since Black is clearly left the crosscut defect at 'a', but to crosscut immediately is also too early.];B[cq]LB[dm:a][dj:b]C[B29: Black is a little difficult. If Black makes the diagonal at 'a', White will fly out at 'a', White can fight adequately.];W[co]C[With the variation following W30, White can be satisfied.];B[do];W[dn];B[eo]
;W[bn];B[cp];W[cm];B[eq];W[fp];B[ep];W[er];B[dr];W[dj];B[ip]C[The attachment of B43 is to serve as ladder breaker.];W[di];B[hq];W[hp]
;B[jq];W[ir];B[jp];W[fn]LB[jr:a][kr:b][hr:c][ho:d][gq:e][qn:f]C[W50 puts emphasis on the whole game, the common move is to turn at 'a', followed by B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e' and B 'f', this way White's thickness at the top is not easy to be used.];B[hr];W[qn];B[qp]
;W[oo]LB[on:a]C[W54: For White to jump at 'a' is the original move, in this game since White is very thick , so White wants to play more positively.];B[om];W[on];B[pm];W[qo];B[nq];W[rl];B[hh];W[jh];B[he];W[je]C[W62 and W64: White is very happy to attack directly,  but it seems White also drives Black into White's own territory.]
;B[dg]LB[fg:a][eg:b]C[The diagonal of B65 is too unreasonable! AFter White strikes at the vital point at 'a', Black sinks into a bitter battle. For Black to jump at 'b' is the original move.];W[fg];B[dh];W[fi];B[ci];W[ej];B[bh];W[bg]C[W68 and W72 are also related good moves, Black is in the risk of being captured.];B[el];W[fl]
;B[fm]C[B73 and B75: Black seeks a way of playing, to make life directly is already not easy.];W[en];B[eh];W[fh];B[fj];W[fk];B[ef];W[gj]C[W82: White gives up chasing and killing Black, perhaps White already feels his situation is not bad, but this way the game becomes longer.];B[ce];W[ff];B[cg];W[fo]

Although Black makes himself thick by sacrificing, but White in the lower right corner is not easily to be killed, this way the game is still to White's advantage.]
;B[oe];W[pj];B[qi];W[oj];B[mg];W[rj];B[mc]C[In the game, Black crawls out with B119, White gains almost nothing.];W[lc];B[lb];W[pb];B[kc];W[kd];B[ld]
;W[le];B[kf];W[lc];B[kb];W[jb];B[ja];W[rh];B[na];W[og];B[ng];W[ra];B[jg]C[B137 again is a good move.];W[hd]C[White can only connect painfully with B138.]
;B[kh]C[After B139, the situation is already turned around.];W[ki];B[lh];W[ji];B[pf];W[pg];B[rg];W[qh];B[mj];W[nj];B[ri];W[si];B[sg]

;B[jf];W[pn]C[W190 is the last losing move! Now to enclose the center at 'a' is clearly bigger, this way the outcome of the game is still hard to guess.]LB[ko:a];B[no];W[ro];B[rp];W[so];B[in];W[gr];B[ks];W[kr];B[jr];W[gq]
