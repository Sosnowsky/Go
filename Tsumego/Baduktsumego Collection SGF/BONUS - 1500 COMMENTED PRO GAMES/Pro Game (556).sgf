;B[om];W[kc];B[fo];W[dk];B[pr]LB[gk:a]C[The descent of B23 is slow, Black should play at 'a' to expand moyo.];W[rl];B[qk];W[rk];B[qj];W[jk]LB[rj:a]C[W28: White acts first in the center, Black is already half-step late. However, with W28 White can also consider to crawl one more move at 'a'. At the game time, I think White already can be satisfied.]
;B[rj];W[qr];B[em];W[dl]LB[gk:a]C[The exchange of B31 and W32 may become damaging, for Black to simply make knight at 'a' is better.];B[gk];W[im];B[gm];W[io];B[ip];W[jo];B[kp];W[ko]
;B[lo];W[ln];B[mn];W[lm]C[From W34 to W44, White handles very happily.];B[qs];W[rs];B[ps];W[qm];B[dc]C[The attachment of B49 is the last big point.];W[cc];B[ed];W[db]
;B[eb];W[ec];B[rr];W[rq];B[dc]LB[hp:a][ho:b][ec:c][eq:d]C[W58: White should play ko threat at 'a', Black has no severe tactic to eliminate the ko now. So Black can only cut at 'b', White takes the ko at 'c', later on White still can take advantage by making diagonal at 'd'.];W[ee]C[After the hane of W58, the ko becomes heavy.];B[fe];W[ec];B[ss]
;W[qo];B[dc];W[de]C[W64: White can only connect, Black takes advantage.];B[jd];W[jc];B[hd];W[mc]LB[hp:a][ho:b][eq:c][hq:d]C[W68: White still should play hane at 'a', next B 'b', W 'c', B 'd' and W68, this variation is better than the real game.];B[do];W[co]
;B[dq]C[B69 and B71 are good moves! White has no follow-up tactic.];W[ep];B[cq];W[ff]C[The hane of W74 is very big.];B[gf]C[Following B75, it leads to a fierce ko fight.];W[ge];B[fd];W[hf];B[gg];W[gd];B[cb];W[ec]

;B[id]LB[da:a]C[B105: For Black to take at 'a' is better.];W[ec];B[ic];W[lp]C[W108: White takes one stone and becomes very thick.];B[dc];W[ho];B[cp];W[ec];B[dm];W[cm];B[dc]
;W[eo]LB[mq:a]C[White can still find ko threat at 'a', Black has no enough ko threats and can only eliminate the ko.];B[da];W[dh]C[W116 and W118: White elects the softest play, still the situation is to White's advantage.];B[hg];W[ob];B[pb];W[nb];B[ej];W[dj];B[eg];W[eh]
;B[oe]LB[pd:a]C[B127: For Black to hang at 'a' is the original move.];W[qb]C[W128: White is left with tactic of living the corner.];B[pa];W[gi];B[hj];W[mq];B[kd]LB[pm:a][ok:b][hi:c]C[B133: If Black strengthens the cut at 'a', White will strike at 'b', since White can press out at 'c' at any time, Black is not comfortable.];W[on]C[W134: White captures eight black stones, this way Black's advantage is more obvious.]
;B[lb]C[B133 and B135: Black fights desperately.];W[lc];B[ia]LB[me:a][mg:b]C[W138: If White escapes at 'a', Black prepares to cap at 'b' and try to capture the big dragon, betting for a victory.];W[hi]C[W138: White presses out and it is a good move, if White captures Black again in the middle, even if White is dead at the top, White still would win the game.];B[ii]LB[ij:a][ji:b]C[The hane of B139 is good move. If White captures at 'a', Black will extend at 'b', the outcome of the game is not clear.];W[ih]C[W140: White seeks to capture big, which is correct choice.];B[jh]C[Afterwards, it leads to an intense fight.]
