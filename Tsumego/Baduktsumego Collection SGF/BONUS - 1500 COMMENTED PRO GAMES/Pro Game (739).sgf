;W[qo];B[jp];W[dn];B[co];W[cn];B[do];W[en];B[ci];W[cf];B[cl];W[dl]LB[dj:a][el:b]C[If W16 at 'a', White is worried that Black may counter-attack by jumping to 'b'.]
;B[dk];W[ek];B[dj];W[fl];B[bn];W[bm];B[bo]C[The play of B21 and B23 is not necessarily to Black's advantage.];W[bl];B[fi];W[ic];B[dm];W[el];B[ck]
;W[cm];B[hi]LB[gp:a]C[B31 seems slow, enclosing territory at 'a' is the key point.];W[eq]LB[fp:a]C[W32 is a strong move, to make the knight's move at 'a' is rather common.];B[er]LB[fp:a]C[B33: Black needs to counter-attack at 'a', the play in the game is weak.];W[fr]C[W34: White takes the opportunity to exploit the aji.];B[fq];W[ep];B[gr]
;W[fp];B[fs];W[gq];B[fr]C[As for the result up to 41, White is clearly favorable.];W[qi]C[After White takes the big point at 42, Black's opening has failed.];B[qg];W[ec];B[pl];W[oi];B[nl];W[mi];B[hl]
;W[hm];B[il];W[im];B[jm];W[ho];B[kc];W[og];B[mg]C[As to the attack of B57, White has nothing to fear.];W[oe];B[od]LB[pf:a][of:b][pd:c][pc:d][qe:e]C[B59 is the proper move, if Black peeps at 'a', then White will connect at 'b', Black still need to reinforce, otherwise, W 'c', B 'd' and W 'e', Black would be difficult to answer.]
;W[qe];B[re];W[rf];B[qf];W[pe];B[rd];W[rg];B[rh];W[qh];B[sf];W[me];B[kg]C[After this move, it is time for lunch break.];W[ke]
;B[sg];W[ng]C[Through 74, White becomes very thick, Black is in an inferior position.];B[jd];W[hd];B[je];W[hf]LB[mq:a]C[W78: To make the two-space extension at 'a' is more substantial.];B[mh];W[nh];B[nj];W[ni];B[mf]
;W[nf];B[nd];W[ne];B[nq]C[After B87, the difference between both sides has been narrowed down, but the game is still to White's advantage.];W[oo];B[pn];W[po];B[or];W[pr];B[ki];W[ok];B[hq];W[mp]
;B[lq];W[dh];B[ej];W[ip]LB[gm:a]C[W100: White prevents Black from playing the hane at 'a'.];B[jn]LB[iq:a][ol:b]C[B101 is the game-deciding move, if Black simply blocks at 'a', then White would push at 'b', Black would have no any chance.];W[io];B[oj];W[pj];B[pk]
;W[qk];B[ql];W[rk]LB[mj:a]C[W108: White certainly should atari at 'a' first.];B[mj]C[After B109, Black has the possibility of enclosing territory in the center.];W[li];B[lj];W[fg]LB[lb:a][kb:b][lc:c][ld:d][md:e]C[W112 is again questionable, striking at 'a' is the vital point, if Black blocks at 'b', then W 'c', B 'd' and W 'e', Black is no good.]
;B[bg];W[bf];B[jb];W[ib];B[kd]C[B115 and B117: Black is alert, White has clearly suffered some losses.];W[kh];B[jh];W[lh];B[jf];W[om];B[ol];W[iq];B[rl]
;W[ri]LB[mm:a]C[W126 is the lasting losing move, White certainly should jump to 'a', this way the game would still to White's advantage.];B[gp];W[go];B[so];W[rn];B[sn];W[sp];B[sm];W[rp];B[gg];W[gf];B[eg]
;W[eh];B[fh];W[ff];B[ia];W[ha];B[ja];W[hb];B[cg];W[dg];B[mn]C[After B147, White is already not optimistic.];W[dp];B[cq];W[ji]

;W[rr];B[ch]LB[ag:a][af:b][bk:c][gk:d]C[B165 is the winning move, Black not only has protected White's sente hane at 'a', and Black also has made the hane and connect at 'b' a sente move, moreover making a miai of the block at 'c' and the diagonal extension at 'd', so far Black has finally turned the game around.];W[ln];B[lm];W[nn];B[mm];W[jq];B[kp];W[kr]
