(;SZ[19]EV[Japan 10th Kisei title match 6]DT[1986-03-12]KM[5.5]PB[Kobayashi Koichi]BR[9p]PW[Cho Chikun]WR[9p]RO[]PC[Japan]RE[B+R]C[Wheelchair Match: After winning Kisei title by defeating Fujisawa Hideyuki 9p, Cho Chikun defeated the challenger Rin Kaiho 9p and Takemiya Masaki 9p in a row, achieving three consecutive Kisei titles. However in early 1986 he was unluckily involved in a car accident, and the tournament sponsor refused to push off the title match agenda. Leaving with no choice, Cho Chikun sat in a wheelchair and bravely fought with his strong opponent since their childhood Kobayashi Koichi in best-of-7 series. Although Kobayashi Koichi eventually won the title by a total score of 4:2, but in the first three games, Cho Chikun won two consecutive games after losing the first one. The most important is, even if siting in a wheelchair and his whole body being bandaged, he released his stones as if he was twisting screws, he never said to quit. Till now, Go fans and players are still deeply touched by this kind of fighting spirit.];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[de]

;B[ed]C[In the large avalanche joseki of the upper left corner, for Black to simply connect at 19 is a trend.];W[fc];B[bd];W[ch];B[bg];W[fd];B[bf]LB[fe:a]C[Through B25, Black ends in gote but is left with the possibility of playing the hane out at 'a', that is just the purpose of B19.];W[kc]LB[nc:a]C[The extension of W26 is appropriate, if White approaches at 'a', Black will play the two-space high pincer.];B[qj]C[B27 taking one line below the star point is Kobayashi's favorite play.]
;W[nq];B[pn];W[pr];B[cn]LB[qq:a][lq:b]C[When White plays W28 and W30, Black takes tenuki and approaches the corner at 31 first, it is a good move, its purpose is to reserve the choice of making the diagonal at 'a' and pincer at 'b'.];W[cl];B[qq];W[kq];B[cq]C[The pincer of W32 is no good, after the exchange of B33 and W34,  B35 entering the corner is inevitable. For White to enclose territory on the left side is not interesting.];W[cp];B[dq]

;W[hf]LB[hd:a]C[The diagonal extension of W50 coordinates with W48, the original move is to hang at 'a'.];B[fg];W[fh]LB[pg:a]C[W52 is no good, White should simply make the knight's move at 'a'.];B[gh];W[fi];B[pc];W[pg];B[ld];W[lc];B[nd]C[B57 and B59 are planned action after B55.]
;W[pj]LB[od:a]C[W60: White seeks variations, if White directly pushes and cuts at 'a', White is not vivid.];B[mc];W[mb];B[md];W[nb];B[od]C[The sequence from B61 to B65 is inevitable.];W[qk];B[qi];W[pi];B[qg]C[B69 is steady, cutting directly is unreasonable.];W[ol]C[Through W70, the fight comes to an end, an exchange has resulted, both sides' gain and loss is about equal. White bravely attaches with W60 to seek variations, its result can be regarded successful. He is really still Cho Chikun!]
;B[np];W[mq];B[ie]C[B73 is a very good move to take advantage in sente.];W[ic];B[bn]LB[cj:a]C[After the clamp of B75, Black prepares to invade at 'a' next.];W[dn];B[cj];W[gi];B[jd];W[jc];B[di]
;W[dh];B[bi];W[lg]LB[lh:a]C[W84 is a questionable move, for White to play at 'a' is better.];B[dm]C[B85 is inevitable and also severe.];W[fn]C[W86: White can't cut.];B[en];W[eo];B[do];W[ef];B[ee];W[dn]
;B[fb];W[gb];B[do];W[fm];B[gd];W[gc];B[kh]C[The diagonal extension of B99 is a good move to reduce the center. So far, Black is favorable in the game.];W[kg]LB[lh:a]C[W100: White can also consider to attach at 'a'.];B[jh];W[hh];B[lh]
;W[jg];B[lk];W[lm];B[ml]LB[mg:a]C[B107: Black is not restrained at all, this way Black already has strengthened the cut after Black's hane at 'a'.];W[mm];B[mg];W[qm];B[qn];W[qr];B[rr];W[rn]LB[rs:a][sr:b]C[W114: White should first exchange W 'a' and B 'b'.]

;W[mj];B[lj];W[mi];B[mh];W[ni];B[gq];W[sm]LB[an:a]C[W30 initiating a ko is not big, for White to hane at 'a' is better.];B[rm];W[li];B[jj];W[rn];B[or]

;B[iq];W[kd]C[W160 is very big, Black already can't connect, this is due to the mistake of B121.];B[og];W[pf];B[ph];W[oh];B[qh];W[ng];B[ke];W[lf];B[mf];W[le];B[ig]

;B[gk];W[hk];B[ik];W[gj];B[fk];W[eq];B[er];W[gg];B[be]C[After B241, Cho Chikun concedes defeat. If proceeding normally to the end, Black will win by only 1.5 to 2.5 points. For Cho Chikun to concede defeat in such a close situation is rare. Perhaps at that time Cho Chikun was already exhausted.

In this game, although White didn't have any big bad move but White made several questionable moves. Black also made several mistakes, but Black's situation is slightly better all the time. Overall, this game was evenly matched, Kobayashi's victory is also not easy.])
