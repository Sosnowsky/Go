(;SZ[19]DT[2001-06-22]EV[3rd Chunlan Cup final game 1]KM[5.5]C[Copyright by gogameworld.com and weiqi.cn.tom.com.]PC[Beijing, China]PB[Yoo Changhyeok]BR[9p]PW[O Rissei]WR[9p]RE[W+6.5];B[pd]C[After guessing stones, Yoo Changhyeok gets to play Black.];W[dc];B[pp]C[The two-star opening is very common, Yoo Changhyeok copes with a constantly changing situation by sticking to a fixed principle.];W[dq]C[The opening of "facing two small-points" is Go Seigen's favorite in his prime time, however it is already seldom seen nowadays.]
;B[do];W[dm]C[W6: White elects to play a tight-pincer which has obviously been prepared.];B[fo];W[fq]
(;B[ho]LB[cq:a][cr:b][cp:c][er:d][cm:e]C[B9: Black elects a simple continuation, now if Black attaches at 'a', then W 'b', B 'c', W 'd' and B 'e', this variation was also once appeared in professional games (see var a).];W[dj];B[iq]C[W10 and B11 are good miai points, each side gets one.];W[qj]C[The splitting move of W12 is inevitable.];B[ql]C[B13: The checking direction of Black is correct, because the center point of Black's outside thickness is in around the lower right corner.];W[qg];B[qe]LB[mc:a]C[B15: For Black to simply make the large-knight's corner enclosure at 'a is also possible.]
;W[oj]C[As to the exchange of B15 and W16, it is hard to decide who is favorable.];B[mc];W[qq]C[W18: White enters the corner, which is consistent with O Rissei's strategy in this game, that is, first grab territory, then make Black's outside influence less useful.];B[pq];W[qp];B[po]LB[qo:a]C[B21 has the implication of taking sente, if Black plays at 'a' as the joseki, Black will end in gote.];W[rn];B[qn];W[qo];B[pn];W[rm]
;B[nk]C[B27: Black is undisguised to expand his moyo.];W[ik]C[The reduction of W28 is imperative.];B[nj];W[qm]C[W30 is just right timing.];B[pm]LB[pl:a]C[B31: If Black draws back at 'a', then after White pushes at 31, Black would be left with many cutting points, Black is not favorable.];W[ol];B[ok];W[pl];B[pk];W[qk]
;B[nl];W[om];B[nm];W[on];B[nn];W[oo];B[np]C[Through 43, White again has grabbed some territory and also obtained sente, White can be satisfied.];W[gl]C[W44 guarding against the cut is very necessary.];B[cf]LB[ce:a][cg:b]C[The select of B45 is relatively difficult, if Black approaches with the small knight's move at 'a', then White would pincer at 'b', Black is not comfortable.];W[cd]
;B[ch]C[B47 seems a low-spirited move but is very practical.];W[ci]LB[bj:a]C[W48: White prevents Black from making a base with the small knight's move at 'a'.];B[ei]LB[dh:a][fi:b]C[B49 is a light and good move, if B 'a', then White would attack with the knight at 'b', Black looks cumbersome.];W[bh];B[di];W[cg];B[dh];W[bg]C[The play of W50 to W54 appears unreasonable.]
;B[cj];W[bi];B[el]C[B57 is an intense tesuji, White is hard to handle. 

After this move , it is time for noon break.];W[dk];B[dl];W[cl];B[ej];W[ck];B[ek]C[With the sequence from W58 through B63, both sides have no way to back down.];W[fn]C[W64 is excellent timing.];B[gn]LB[en:a]C[B65: If Black plays at 'a', then W 65, Black is no good.]
;W[hh]LB[fm:a]C[W66 is a steady move, if White pulls out at 'a' directly, White has no certainty of success.];B[fm];W[jh]C[For White to reinforce with W68 is necessary.];B[id]C[B69: Black adopts a slow-attack tactic, trying to keep balance in territory.];W[cm]C[W70 seems small but big in reality, it is related to the thickness and thinness of both sides and threatens Black as well.];B[hf]LB[en:a]C[B71: Black is reluctant to reinforce at 'a'.];W[en]C[W72: White attacks in order to defend, it is the most relentless play.];B[hj]
;W[ij];B[hi];W[ii];B[gh]C[The sequence from B73 to B77 appears crude but is very practical.];W[jm]C[W78 protects the cut and also serves as a reduction move.];B[kk]C[B79: Black hits White's vital point, White is not comfortable.];W[kj];B[jl];W[il];B[km]LB[eo:a]C[B81 and B83: Black tangles tightly with White, both sides are eyeing for the good point at 'a'.]
;W[jk];B[kl];W[in];B[jn];W[io]C[W86 and W88 are good move, Black is not easy to handle.];B[im];W[hm];B[gm];W[jm]LB[eo:a]C[W92: If White pushes at 'a', White lacks confidence on his big group's safety.];B[eo];W[hp]
;B[gp];W[jo];B[kn];W[gq];B[hq]C[Through 99, White is leading in territory, but White's big dragon in the center is not completely alive, the outcome of the game is still not clear.];W[hg];B[gg];W[if];B[jf]C[B103 is a game-deciding move.];W[ie];B[ig];W[ih]
;B[jg];W[je];B[lg]C[Through 109, it leads to a complicated fight, White is relatively more dangerous.];W[ke];B[lf];W[ip];B[kq];W[jq];B[jr];W[kp];B[kr];W[lh];B[he]LB[mh:a]C[B119 is inexplicable, why not hane at 'a'? It can be explained as that Yoo Changhyeok thinks this way is good enough to win the game.]
;W[nh];B[le];W[hd];B[ic]C[Through 123, Black still doesn't completely capture White's stones.];W[nc]LB[gf:a]C[W124: White seeks a chance of fight, but it seems that separating Black immediately at 'a' would be better, see how Black to deal with it.];B[gd]C[B125: Black has completely reinforced here.];W[pc]LB[md:a]C[W126 seems no better than the hane move at 'a', probing Black.];B[oc]C[B127 is an intense tesuji, White is hard to deal with.]
;W[ob];B[od];W[nd];B[pb];W[mb];B[ng]C[B133 is a typical two-pronged strategy.];W[kc]C[The jump of W134 is a game-deciding move.];B[oh]C[After B135, White looks dangerous, but in fact White is very resilient.];W[gf]C[W136: White first ataris and cuts, leaving Black a hidden trouble.];B[ge];W[ff]
;B[eg];W[mg];B[nf];W[og];B[md]C[B143 is a good move.];W[ne];B[mf];W[mh];B[of];W[ef]C[W148 is an excellent timing.];B[kd]LB[oi:a][ki:b]C[B149: Black seemingly has a misconception, he can win the game if capturing White's stones, now for Black to play at 'a' would be more ruthless, Black also has the clamp at 'b', White is not easy to live unconditionally.]
;W[hk]C[W150: White has grabbed the chance and force Black to make life, Black instead sinks into a difficult situation.];B[cq]LB[gj:a]C[B151: Black should simply play at 'a', it is obviously better than the real game.];W[cr];B[bq];W[dp];B[cp];W[br];B[fj]LB[bo:a]C[B157: If Black plays at 'a', then W 157, Black is no good.];W[co]
;B[gk]C[The cut of W158 is very big, Black has clearly suffered some losses.];W[oi];B[pg];W[ph];B[og];W[ni];B[kb]LB[qb:a]C[B165: Black has played one more move to prevent White from atari and crossing over at 'a' to make life.];W[rf]C[W166: White is alert.];B[re];W[fl];B[em]
;W[dn]C[Through 170, Black is already not optimistic.];B[fg];W[gb];B[gc];W[jb];B[jc];W[fb]C[From W172 to W176, White has taken advantage in sente, Black is very painful.];B[hb];W[df]C[W178 is a declaration of victory, Black already has no chance of winning.];B[bo];W[cn];B[gr]
