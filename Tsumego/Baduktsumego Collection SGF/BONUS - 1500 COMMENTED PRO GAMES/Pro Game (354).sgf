Translation:GoGameWorld.];B[qd]C[Black is KongJie 7P of China];W[dc]C[White is Lee SeDol 9P of Korea];B[pp]C[Kong Jie, the current #2 player in rankings, did pretty well in the recent national and worldwide Go tournaments, making people feel more and more comfortable with his games. In the Samsung Cup of last year, he was eliminated by Lee Sedol, this time he beautifully got even.];W[dp]

;B[fq]C[The opening up to B31 was very popular several years ago. In the very early stage of the game, it forms a position of White's influence vs. Black's territory. It seems Kong Jie is well prepared for a prolonged fight.];W[od];B[oe];W[ne];B[of];W[qc];B[nd];W[pd];B[qe];W[nc];B[md];W[pe]C[W42: White directly pushes, showing Lee Sedol warlike style.]

;W[kc];B[pj];W[qj];B[qk]TR[ne]C[B57: Black originally thought that he could take the chance to capture the marked white stone while allowing White to stick the head out but didn't expect White instead gets to "borrow strength".];W[ng]C[White first attaches with W58 then nets with W60, W58 and 60 are good moves! This kind of play is Lee Sedol's strong point.];B[nf];W[mf];B[me];W[og];B[mg]C[With the sequence following B65, both sides have no way to back down, in the fight the one who is first softhearted will sink into passivity.];W[lf]
;B[pg];W[ph];B[ne];W[qi];B[kf];W[lg];B[oh];W[mh];B[nh];W[mg]LB[pk:a][ql:b]C[W76: White is overly chasing the good feeling of fighting, W76 can be regarded as the losing move of the game. In fact, at this juncture White only needs to simply cut at 'a', next Black takes at 76 and White can capture one stone by playing at 'b', White would already open up the situation this way. Although Black takes two stones, but actually Black as a whole is still not completely alive, so Black is not thick.];B[pi]
;W[qh];B[pk];W[rk];B[rl];W[sk]LB[rj:a][si:b]C[W82 is no good! White should simply connects at 'a', in the game after B 'b', this white group is already dead.];B[si];W[rj]C[After t his move it is time for noon break, to be continued at 13:30.];B[qb];W[pc];B[jd]LB[qm:a]C[B87: For Black to hang at 'a' is the most relentless play. It would be very hard for White not allowing the center black extend to 8 liberties, we tried a lot of variations and feel that the chance of White's death is bigger. However after a deep thinking, Kong Jie elects to play the steady move of B87, perhaps he feels only if the game proceeds to the endgame, Black would have more chance of winning.]

;W[gh];B[gm];W[rn];B[em]C[When White probes Black with W116, Black takes tenuki to handle his lonely group, it is a good judgement! On the right side, no matter how Black to answer, the aji in the corner woud be still very bad.];W[dn];B[dk];W[dl];B[el];W[fj];B[fk];W[ej];B[ek];W[qq]
