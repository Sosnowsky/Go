;B[nq];W[qj];B[ql];W[qf];B[qh];W[of];B[nc];W[rd];B[pi];W[qc];B[kc]C[The opening up to B17 is common.];W[fp]LB[ep:a][eq:b][eo:c][dq:d][gp:e]C[W18 is a good move, now Black can play wedge at 'a', otherwise after W 'b', B 'c' and W 'd', B 'e' capturing in a ladder is not working.]
;B[cj];W[gq]LB[eq:a]C[Comparing W20 with W 'a', each has its own pros and cons.];B[cp]C[The sequence following B21 is common tactic.];W[cq];B[do];W[ep];B[co];W[bq];B[cf];W[fc];B[bd]
;W[ic];B[cc];W[ob];B[ke];W[dc];B[pj]C[Through B35, Black has nothing to complain in the opening.];W[cl];B[el];W[dk];B[fn];W[dm];B[kp]TR[fn][el]C[B41 is a strategic conception related the marked stones, Black's moyo from the lower-right corner to the center is very significant.]
;W[kn];B[io];W[in];B[jn]C[B45 is a relentless move, White has no good way to counterattack.];W[jm];B[jo];W[mm];B[jl]LB[im:a][en:b]C[B49 is tesuji for attacking, but Black may end in gote, for Black to simply atari at 'a' and connect back at 'b' after obtaining sente is perhaps steadier.];W[km];B[im]
;W[il];B[hn];W[eo]TR[dk][cl][dm]C[W54 is substantial, White has a lot of territory and White's three marked stones also have obtained safety.];B[jk];W[pm];B[qm];W[lk];B[nn]C[B59: Black destroys White's eye shape and also seeks balance in territory.];W[nm];B[on]
;W[mn];B[mo];W[lo];B[mp];W[jr]LB[ir:a]C[B66 is to prevent Black from enclosing territory at 'a'.];B[fj]TR[il]C[B67 reinforcing itself and also restricting the action of the marked white stone is very necessary.];W[hm];B[in];W[lr]LB[ie:a]C[W70 is not small, but for White to jump at 'a' looks steady.]
;B[ie];W[jd];B[kd];W[nr];B[or];W[rg]C[W76 is a big endgame for both sides, on the board White has over 60 points in territory, how much territory Black can enclose in the center will be the key for the game.];B[hb]C[B77 is a common sacrificing tactic.];W[ib];B[hc];W[hd];B[id];W[he]LB[gc:a]C[W82 counter-sacrificing is a good move, if White tries to capture two stones at 'a', it just fits Black's intention.]
;B[hf];W[if];B[je];W[gf];B[hg];W[gg];B[hh];W[mq]C[W90 makes Black very uncomfortable.];B[lq];W[mr];B[lp]C[B93: Black takes a very big risk.];W[jj]
;B[ik];W[nj];B[mj]C[B97 is the strongest attack.];W[ni];B[mk];W[nk];B[lj];W[ng]C[Through W102, White gets to connect back, but Black also gains some profit in the middle.];B[rh];W[oq]C[B103 and W104 are good miai points.];B[pr];W[np]
;B[om];W[ol];B[ml];W[nl];B[qe];W[re];B[fb]C[B113 is a very big move itself and Black also aims to attack White.];W[gc];B[gb];W[eb];B[jb]LB[gd:a]C[B117: Black should first play at 'a'.]
;W[cd];B[gd];W[be];B[bf];W[bc];B[fd]C[Through B123, it forms an exchange and White has nothing to complain.];W[dj];B[ci];W[di];B[dh];W[eh];B[dg];W[fi]C[W130: White takes chance to connect together, Black's situation is not optimistic.]
;B[bk];W[bl];B[al];W[am];B[ak];W[bm];B[nb];W[gj]C[B137 and W138 are also miai big endgames.];B[gk];W[hj];B[ej];W[hk]C[W142 is a good move.]
;B[hl]LB[ei:a]C[If B143 at 'a', then White will play at 143, Black is not good.];W[ij];B[ll];W[gl];B[fl];W[gh];B[ge];W[fk];B[gm];W[ck];B[ek];W[ei]C[After W154, White's advantage becomes obvious.]
;B[bi];W[po]C[W156 is earlier remained tactic.];B[pp];W[no];B[en];W[dn];B[pb];W[qn]C[After W162, Black already has no chance to win.];B[rn];W[pc];B[oc];W[qb]
