;B[do];W[dp];B[ep];W[eo];B[gp];W[en];B[go];W[cm];B[hq]C[Through B15, it forms a classic joseki, this joseki appears very often recently. With W14, White can also descend at 15, it will lead to a fierce fight.];W[ce];B[fd]LB[ed:a]C[The small knight's move of B17 is a very thoughtful move,  for Black to make the diagonal extension at 'a' is also possible, its difference perhaps can only be understood by professional players.]
;W[kc];B[ic];W[oc];B[pf];W[ke]C[W22, to reinforce, is necessary.];B[ch];W[cc]C[The set pattern following W24 is also very simple and clear.];B[cb];W[dd]LB[db:a]C[W26: White can also consider to cut at 'a'.];B[ec];W[bc]LB[qh:a]C[The value of W28 is very big, however White can also consider to force at 'a', this is more active.]

;B[or]C[B41 probing White is good timing.];W[pq]LB[oq:a][nr:b][on:c]C[W42: White can also squeeze at 'a', next B 'b' and W 'c', this way it is more efficient, but it seems to help Black to enclose territory. In the game, the connection of W42 is calm. White is considering next to do something inside Black's territory.];B[kn];W[in];B[hn]LB[jp:a]C[When White plays the shallow reduction of W44, the original move of B45 is to answer at 'a'. In the game, Black seeks high efficiency with the diagonal of B45.];W[iq]C[W46: White suddenly invades into Black's territory, Hu Yaoyu's braveness and strength is worth praising. Here the fight will decide the game.];B[io]
;W[lq];B[jq];W[hr];B[gq]LB[ip:a][jr:b]C[The connection of B51 is questionable, Black should atari at 'a', next W51 and B52, it would be still a complicated fight.];W[jr];B[ip];W[ir]C[Through W54, White already has a living shape, Black is in a losing situation.];B[cl]C[With the sequence following B55, Black tries to make the game chaotic.];W[dl]C[With the sequence following W56, White takes an unyielding attitude.]

;W[ao];B[bl];W[ak]LB[gm:a][kq:b]C[Through W72, locally White is fast by one liberty in the capturing race, but Black gets to make the diagonal at 'a' in sente, Black can kill all invading White stones by bumping at 'b'. But this exchange is still to White's advantage.];B[dj]LB[gm:a]C[B73: For Black to play at 'a' for an exchange is better.];W[el];B[di];W[bh];B[fl];W[fk]
;B[ej];W[ek];B[bg];W[cg];B[an];W[dh];B[cq];W[fj]C[Through B86, an exchange has resulted, Black's loss is huge.];B[qm]C[B87, Black has no state of mind to continue the fight.];W[bq];B[br];W[pm]
