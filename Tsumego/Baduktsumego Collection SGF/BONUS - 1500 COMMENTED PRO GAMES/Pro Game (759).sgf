Translation:GoGameWorld.];B[pd]C[In the 8th Samsung Cup preliminary, seven Chinese players have advanced, this result is quite good, Kong Jie 7p, who is in a very good state recently, defeated Yang Jaeho 9p in the final round.];W[dd];B[pq];W[cp];B[eq]
;W[do]C[The diagonal's extension of W6 is a very thick move, which is also Kong Jie's keen on.];B[qo];W[hq];B[ci];W[ck];B[cf];W[ce];B[df];W[fc];B[cr]LB[kp:a][fp:b][pj:c]C[Although the knight's move of B15 is playable, but I prefer to make the extension at 'a', then W 'b' and B 'c', building a moyo, this way the effect of making the first move can be easily shown, in the real game, it would most likely lead to a close and prolonged game.]
;W[kq];B[mq];W[qf];B[qh];W[of];B[nc]LB[nd:a][pi:b][qe:c]C[The small knight's move of B21 is questionable, Black should jump to 'a', White will press with the knight's move at 'b', then B 'c'.];W[pi];B[qe];W[rf]LB[qi:a][od:b]C[W24: If White blocks at 'a', Black can hane at 24 in sente and can be satisfied. If White still descends at 24 as in the game, Black crawls at 'a', through 31, White doesn't have the good attaching move at 'b', it makes a big difference.]
;B[qi];W[pj];B[ph];W[oh];B[qj];W[pk];B[qk]TR[qo]LB[ql:a][pl:b]C[B31: For Black to jump to 'a' would be better. Due to the addition of the marked black stone, the value of the hane at 'b' is not that big as expected.];W[od];B[pc]LB[oe:a][oc:b]C[After the attachment of W32, the descent of B33 almost can't be tolerated! At any rate, Black should wedge at 'a' or block at 'b', although it may not be good, but the play in the game is too grievous.]
;W[ni];B[pl];W[ol];B[om];W[nl];B[fp];W[br]C[The sequence after W40 is very solid, White tries to keep balance with Black in territory, ];B[en];W[cm];B[ho];W[ko]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.];B[nm]
;W[mm];B[pm];W[ll]C[Through the tiger's move at 48, White has completely opened up the situation.];B[kc];W[dr];B[hm];W[bf];B[bg];W[be]C[The hane and connection of W52 and W54 are huge.];B[hc]LB[kf:a]C[Although the two-space extension of B55 is very big, but from a global point's of view, for Black to jump at 'a' would be better, this is related to the thickness or thinness and moyo expansion or reduction for both sides.];W[kd]C[The attachment of W56 is a good move, making White himself thick by borrowing strength from Black.]
;B[jd];W[lc];B[ld];W[ke];B[lb];W[dh];B[og]LB[pg:a][ch:b][le:c][cg:d]TR[jd][qf][rf]C[B63 is the losing move! After being captured by W 'a', Black has not only incurred losses in points, the aji of thickness and thinness has also disappeared. There are two ways to play B63, one is to block at 'b' directly, if White tries to capture the marked black stone in a ladder, then Black can wedge at 63 and capture the two marked white stones, which is not small. Second, Black can attach at 'c', W 'd' and B63, it would lead to an exchange, this way although you can's say Black is definitely optimistic, but the road to victory and defeat would be still very far.]
;W[pg]C[In the game White captures B63 in sente, White has not only gained some points but also become very thick.];B[le];W[lf];B[ch];W[kf];B[mc];W[eo];B[fo];W[fm]C[W72: White again starts to attack Black, Black appears weak across the board.];B[fl];W[gm];B[gl]
;W[em];B[jp];W[jq];B[il];W[hk];B[hl];W[di]C[The attack after W82 is very natural. In fact, White doesn't need to kill Black and Black is not necessarily leading in territory, so Black can't afford to lose more territory.];B[ed];W[ec];B[de];W[cc];B[ff];W[fh]
