;W[nq];B[od];W[ic];B[fc];W[lc];B[mb]C[B12: Yoda's opening is special.];W[mc];B[nb]C[But B11 and B13 are all played on second line and Black also ends in gote.];W[qk];B[qp];W[qq];B[rq]
;W[qo];B[rp];W[po];B[ro];W[qr];B[rm]C[In the lower right corner, from B15 to B23, Black again plays on the second line, it is really difficult to understand.];W[pm];B[pn];W[on];B[qm];W[om];B[gq]LB[hq:a]C[B29: At any rate, with B29 Black should split at 'a'.]
;W[iq]C[In the real game, White is too comfortable!];B[ip];W[jq]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.];B[dq]C[However, following B33, Black makes White's corner thick, Black's loss outweighs his gains.];W[cq];B[ep];W[cp];B[er];W[eo];B[fo];W[en];B[cr]
;W[fp];B[eq];W[cj];B[go];W[cf];B[cl]C[The invasion of B47 is imperative.];W[dk];B[cn];W[dm]C[But White answers calmly with W48 and W50.];B[bo];W[cc]LB[bp:a]C[Afterwards, White preserves the block at 'a' and elects to attach in the upper left corner, White takes initiative.]
;B[dd]LB[dc:a][bc:b]C[B53: If Black plays hane at 'a' instead, then White will descend at 'b', Black has no follow-up.];W[bd];B[be];W[bc];B[ce];W[dc];B[ec];W[bf];B[ae];W[df];B[ee]
;W[db]C[Through W64, White makes life in corner, Black instead comes under attack, White is clearly favorable.];B[fg];W[ef];B[ff];W[gd]C[When B65, White pushes with W66 then peeps with W68.];B[fe];W[if]C[W70: White grabs the vital point, White's tempo is better.];B[dh];W[ch];B[di];W[ci];B[bq]C[B75: Black has to reinforce.]
;W[fi]C[W76: White attacks Black and also takes into account his own safety.];B[gi]C[After this move, the game was closed for first day.];W[gj];B[gh];W[hj];B[ih];W[kg];B[ji];W[fj]LB[nf:a][fk:b]TR[fi]C[W84 is slow, White should strengthen at 'a', the game would be over very early. Since if Black cuts at 84, White can give up the marked stone and play atari at 'b'.]
;B[bb];W[ab];B[ba];W[eb];B[fb];W[ca];B[ea];W[ad];B[kd]C[B93: Black pounds on White's thinness, this is Black's chance.];W[kc];B[id];W[hd];B[jd]
;W[hb]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.];B[fa];W[cb];B[kf]LB[jf:a]C[B101: Black should simply attach at 'a'.];W[lf];B[jf];W[me];B[hf]LB[lg:a]C[B105: Black must cut at 'a' to tie up White.];W[rd]C[The attachment of W106 is good move, Black clearly couldn't counterattack, White takes advantage in sente.]
;B[rc];W[qe];B[pd];W[lh]LB[pg:a]C[W110 is overly tenacious, if White just reinforces lightly at 'a', White will win the game easily.];B[jp];W[kp];B[kq];W[ko];B[jn];W[kr];B[lq];W[lr]
;B[mg];W[lg];B[qg];W[kj];B[kn]LB[qi:a]C[B123: Black loses the last winning chance. If Black makes one-space extension at 'a', the game would be close. Since Black in the center is ko-alive, White dares not start the ko easily.];W[nc];B[oc];W[pg]C[After White comes back with W126, White is winning.];B[qf];W[qh];B[pf]

;W[gf];B[ig];W[hg];B[if];W[ge];B[gg];W[ml]C[W186: White encloses territory in center and achieves a big victory.];B[bg]C[In this game, Yoda "tiger" is as soft as a sheep!];W[cg];B[no];W[oo];B[hl]
