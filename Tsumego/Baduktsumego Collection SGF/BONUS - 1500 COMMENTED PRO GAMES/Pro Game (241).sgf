;W[eq];B[fq];W[dq];B[fp];W[cn];B[dp];W[cq];B[jq]LB[jp:a]C[B13: For Black to make extension at 'a' is relatively common, in the real game, Black plays on the third line, it is specially territory-oriented.];W[qn];B[po];W[rp];B[pl]
;W[pn];B[qo];W[ro];B[rm];W[qq];B[rn];W[pr];B[on]C[In the lower right corner, the sequence from W14 to B25 is a typical joseki.];W[oo];B[pm]C[White exchanges W26 with B27 earlier on, the gain or loss is not clear.];W[qf];B[qe]LB[nc:a]C[B29: For Black to make the knight's move at 'a' is also possible.]
;W[pf];B[nd]C[B29 and B31: Black elects a simply play.];W[pi];B[ic]C[Black's extension with B33 is appropriate, it is a both offensive and defensive play.];W[lc]C[W34: White invades immediately, next White can strike the upper right corner at 3-3, it is Choi's style relentless play!];B[re]C[The descent of B35 is the strongest answer, this guards against White's strike at 3-3 and also threatens three white stones' eye shape on the right side.];W[mg];B[kd];W[kc];B[nf];W[ng]
;B[mf]C[B37, B39 and B41 are Xie He's unique attacking tempo, and this leads both sides into an extremely dangerous situation.];W[oc];B[nc];W[jd];B[lg];W[mi];B[jc];W[id];B[hd]LB[hc:a][gc:b][le:c]C[B49: Black can only play hane like this, if Black retreats at 'a', White can press at 49, after Black retreats at 'b', White will jump at 'c', Black is not good.]

(;B[he]LB[gd:a][ib:b][jb:c][if:d][fc:e][gb:f][ia:g][fb:h]C[B55: Black can also press at 'a', next W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 'e', W 'f', B 'g' and W 'h', this forms a big-scale variation (see var a).];W[if];B[gb];W[fc];B[fb];W[ec]
;B[eb];W[db];B[cc];W[dc];B[hf]C[B65: Black can only press out, if Black strengthens the upper side, White will cap at 65, Black is not good for the whole game.];W[ig];B[hg];W[ih];B[df]
(;W[od]LB[cf:a][ce:b][de:c][cg:d][bf:e][dg:f][hh:g]C[W70: For White to attach at 'a' is steady. Although Black can obtain sente by B 'b', next W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', and B 'f',  but next Black needs to strengthen the upper side, White can grab the excellent point at 'g' and can be satisfied (see var a).];B[oe];W[nb]C[B70 and B72 are local good moves.];B[ob];W[kb];B[ib]
;W[mb];B[pc];W[la]LB[jb:a]C[Next after White makes eye with W78 (if White reduces liberty at 'a', there will be a multi-stage ko), White can capture several black stones cleanly.];B[cb]C[But Black has the tactic of clamping with B79, and White's outside every where get affected.];W[ca];B[ba];W[da];B[cd];W[ef];B[eg];W[ee]
;B[dg];W[ce];B[de];W[bd]C[White solves the difficult problem in the upper-left corner with local good moves from W84 to W90.];B[be];W[bb];B[cf];W[bc];B[ce];W[ff];B[fg];W[aa];B[li]
;W[mj];B[lj]C[But after Black presses with B99 and B101, Black forms a two-prong attack on White.];W[hi];B[qh]LB[mk:a]C[B103 is a careless move. Black should play hane at 'a', White on the right side is difficult.];W[qi];B[ph];W[rh];B[rg];W[si];B[rj];W[ri]
;B[lh];W[le];B[oh];W[oi];B[og];W[ml];B[md];W[ji];B[kl];W[nh];B[sg];W[lm]C[After White sticks the head out with W116 and W122, if Black can't attack White effectively, Black's situation is not optimistic.];B[op]
;W[no];B[np];W[mo];B[or];W[pp];B[qm];W[oq];B[nq];W[rr];B[ps]C[B133 is a good move.];W[pq];B[mr];W[lq]
;B[lr];W[qs]C[W134 and W138 are steady moves.];B[qk];W[kq];B[ko]C[B141 is a game-deciding move.];W[km];B[lk];W[nm]LB[nj:a]C[After the exchange of B143 and W144, Black is left with the tactic of attaching at 'a', but in this game Black never have a chance.];B[lp];W[il]LB[lf:a][dj:b][jp:c][kp:d][iq:e][jr:f][jo:g]C[W146: White hopes Black to connect back at 'a', then come back and grab the big point at 'b', this is White's wishful thinking. Now White should play hane at 'c', next B 'd', W 'e', B 'f' and W 'g'.]
;B[ik];W[hk];B[hl]C[B147 and B149 are intense moves.];W[gk];B[jl];W[mp];B[mq];W[kp];B[jp];W[lo];B[kr];W[im];B[ok]

;W[dj]LB[gh:a][gg:b][bk:c][bj:d][bl:e][cj:f]C[W172 is the last losing move. Now White should peep at 'a', after exchanging with B 'b', then W 'c', B 'd' (if B 'e', White can play at 'f'), W 'e', the outcome of the game is difficult to imagine.];B[cj];W[di];B[ci];W[bl];B[bk]C[After Black protects the side territory from B173 to B177, Black already wins the game for sure.];W[gn]
