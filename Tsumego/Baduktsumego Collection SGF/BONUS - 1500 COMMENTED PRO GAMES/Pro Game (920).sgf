;W[po];B[qo];W[qn];B[qp];W[pn];B[nq];W[qg];B[pe];W[pj];B[de];W[qb];B[nd]C[If W2 at star point, with B15 Black generally will play at 17. Piao Wenyao thinks, the corner approach of B15 is an obvious big point. White has no very good attacking tactic to B1 and B13.];W[nc]
;B[md];W[mc];B[ld];W[kc]C[Through W22, both sides are acceptable.];B[pg];W[ph];B[qh];W[qi];B[rh];W[rg];B[oh];W[pi]C[Locally Black must have incurred loss in the sequence from B23 to W30.]
;B[cc]C[But Black is able to grab the big point with B31, the situation is still very balanced.];W[cn];B[ck];W[cq];B[cp];W[dq];B[ep];W[bp];B[bo];W[bq];B[co];W[fq];B[dd]
;W[ec];B[cb]C[Through B45, Black's opening is successful.];W[pf];B[og];W[of];B[qf];W[rf];B[nf];W[qe];B[oe];W[qf];B[pc];W[pb]
;B[mh];W[kd];B[ol]C[B59 is the cause leading to the fierce fight. White has no other choices but to counterattack.];W[pp]C[Piao Wenyao thinks, the purpose of B59 is to obtain sente and attack the two white stones W2 and W44. If White reinforces here, Black will pincer-attack these two stones. And when White attacks Black's upper-right group, B59 can help.];B[qq];W[kf]C[Of course, Yoda is not falling into the "trap" and elects to jump out with W62.];B[ql]C[However, afterwards, Wang Xi (Black) plays very brilliantly.];W[nj];B[ml];W[np];B[mq]
;W[mp];B[kg];W[jg];B[jh]C[B69 and B71 are good moves.];W[lg];B[kh];W[lh];B[lf];W[le];B[li];W[mf];B[mg];W[lf]
;B[mj]C[Through B81, Zhang Xuebin thinks, White's two groups have developed into pie shape, and all white stones are played inside and their strength can't be utilized. This is the root cause why Yoda (White) is always passive in the game while White didn't play any obvious bad move.];W[nk];B[nl];W[mk];B[lk];W[ni];B[mi];W[ll];B[lm];W[kl];B[kk];W[jl];B[kn]

;W[go]C[Zhang Xuebin thinks, locally, White didn't incur loss in the exchange starting from W120.];B[ho]C[But in terms of the whole game, Wang Xi (Black) is clearly favorable. The reason is Yoda's early mentioned pie shape.];W[gp];B[io];W[bn];B[dm];W[dn];B[fn];W[fo];B[em];W[cl];B[dk]
;W[dl];B[el];W[bl];B[bj];W[ek];B[fk];W[ej]C[White's sequence from W130 to W138 are good moves to exploit Black.];B[fj]C[Yoda plays very calmly and destroys Wang Xi's territory slowly.];W[fe]C[W140 is mutual good point. now Yoda must have made accurate overall situation analysis.];B[ff];W[gf];B[fg]
;W[ee];B[ef];W[gg]LB[fh:a]C[Through W146, if Black simply plays at 'a', Black will lose the game by small margin.];B[fc]C[B147: Black releases game-deciding move, hoping to turn the situation around.];W[fh];B[dg];W[hi];B[jj];W[gj];B[hh]C[After study, we concluded that Wang Xi didn't miscalculate. Even if Black didn't play atari of B153, White still can save W136 and W138 two stones. We can only say, Yoda plays so well.];W[fl]C[W154 is good move!]
;B[gl];W[gk];B[fm];W[fi];B[fl];W[gh];B[gi];W[gc];B[fb];W[hi];B[hk];W[di]C[The sequence up to W166 is almost "one way street". After Yoda's combination of punches, Wang Xi again loses a lot of territory.];B[ch]

;B[iq];W[sm];B[lp];W[hn];B[hm];W[ir]C[Through W186, Wang Xi's territory is not enough and he has to concede the game.

Yoda advances to the semi final, which will take place on 7/7.])
