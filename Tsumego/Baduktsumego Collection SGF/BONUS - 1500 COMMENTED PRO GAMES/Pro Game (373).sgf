;W[oc];B[ep];W[ck];B[ce];W[fd];B[ch];W[pf];B[cc];W[cb];B[dd]LB[bc:a][ed:b]C[When Black attaches with B13 and hangs with B15, with W16 White can't atari at 'a', this way Black clearly takes advantage, in this case W10 is better to be played as the diagonal at 'b'.];W[ec]
;B[kc];W[ic]LB[pd:a]C[Black plays the splitting move of B17, but the play of W18 is not good, to make the diagonal at 'a' is better.];B[od];W[pd];B[pe];W[pc];B[qe];W[oe];B[nd];W[qc]LB[nc:a]C[In the game, because of the exchange of B17 and W18, through W26 in the big-scale joseki, B 'a' becomes effective, this is perhaps what White has overlooked.]
;B[nc];W[of]LB[qf:a]C[Because Black is favorable in the ladder, White couldn't block at 'a'.];B[re];W[rc];B[qh];W[nb];B[mb];W[ob];B[le]C[Through B35, Black gets to play on both sides, Black's play is much more efficient.];W[mf];B[pi]LB[qj:a]C[B37: For Black to jump to 'a' is more steady.]
;W[lf];B[id];W[hc];B[kf];W[kg];B[me];W[lh];B[jf];W[jg]LB[pl:a]C[Although W46 is a thick play, but in an unfavorable situation, for White to clamp at 'a' is better, this way the situation would be a little chaotic.];B[ql]C[Black is able to extend with B47, Black's opening is successful.];W[en]
;B[cm]LB[cp:a][bo:b]C[B49 is a good move, if Black simply bumps at 'a', White will descend at 'b'.];W[dm];B[cp];W[cn];B[iq];W[bc];B[if];W[qq];B[qp];W[pq];B[oq]
;W[or];B[nr]LB[rq:a][rr:b]C[B61: Black can also consider to hane at 'a', after W 'b', then Black can play B61.];W[nq];B[op];W[mr];B[pr];W[ns];B[qr];W[kq];B[kr];W[jr]
;B[jq];W[lr];B[ir];W[ks]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.];B[mj]C[Through B75, Black is simply favorable for the game, and Lee Changho is very good at this kind of situation, but later on something unexpected happens.];W[bi];B[bh];W[ci];B[eh];W[gh];B[cd];W[nl]
;B[ni]LB[ng:a][nf:b][pj:c][ok:d]C[B83 looks like a very steady move, but it is not perfect, here Black should first exchange B 'a' and W 'b', then play B83. This way, when White attaches at 'c', Black can counterattack at 'd'.];W[pl];B[pm];W[om];B[pn];W[pj];B[ng];W[qk]C[When White attaches with W88, Black strikes with B89, White certainly wouldn't connect and elects to hang at 90 instead, Black clearly incurs loss in territory with this exchange.];B[nf]
;W[qm];B[hh];W[hi];B[ih];W[lj];B[lk];W[kj];B[ok];W[ol];B[mk];W[ri]C[W102 is a relentless move, White wants to take advantage again, the territory between both sides is already very close.];B[ii];W[kk]

;B[ij]LB[jk:a][kl:b][el:c]C[B131 is too straightforward! If Black plays at 'a', the wedge at 'b' and the strike at 'c' would become miai, White is hard to look after both sides.];W[fl];B[bj]LB[gk:a]C[Black first probes White with B133, then takes the chance to extend out at 'a', this perhaps is also what Black thinks when plays the connection of B131.];W[gq]C[The invasion of W134 shows Lee Sedol's sharp situational judgement. Locally White already doesn't know how to answer B133, so White simply takes tenuki.];B[gp]LB[go:a][hp:b][io:c][kl:d]C[B135: Black falls into trap! This is the losing move of the game! Black should make the knight's move at 'a',  next W 'b' and B 'c', locally White is already hard to retreat as a whole, also if Black is thick on the outside, Black's wedge at 'd' would be very severe.]
;W[hp];B[hq];W[fp];B[go];W[fo];B[fq];W[gr];B[fr]LB[gk:a]C[By the sequence from W136 to B143, White already successfully prevents Black from extending out at 'a', Black clearly fails.];W[aj];B[ak];W[ai];B[fe]
