;W[nc];B[mc];W[ob];B[ph]C[Through B21, it is joseki, Black's configuration is not bad.];W[id];B[je]C[In the first three game, Lee Changho leads 2:1, as to Mok Jinseok, he must fight to win or die in this game.];W[ie];B[jf];W[if];B[jg];W[hh];B[ji]LB[jj:a][ii:b][cc:c][dp:d]C[B29 is simple and steady, it is Lee Changho's style, the common thinking is jumping at 'a', making the knight's move at 'b', entering corner at 'c' or taking the empty corner at 'd'.]
;W[dp];B[cc];W[dc];B[cd];W[ce];B[be];W[cf]LB[cb:a]C[W36: White can consider to play hane at 'a'.];B[bf];W[cg];B[db];W[eb];B[cb]
;W[fc]C[Here White is over-cautious, it seems White is over-concentrated.];B[bg];W[ch];B[qp]C[B45 is very big.];W[pk];B[pl]C[Lee Changho 9p wiped his face with a towel. In the study room, Lee Sedol 9p said, this shows that Lee Changho feels that his situation is not bad. These top-rated players know each other very well, any tiny body language can be decoded quickly.];W[qj]C[White must do something in this area.];B[ql];W[oj];B[ni];W[ol]

;B[nj];W[mj];B[og];W[le];B[kd]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.];W[kh];B[jh];W[kj]LB[qb:a][pa:b][jb:c]C[White in the middle is not stable, making life and also not affecting territory in other places is a difficult problem. White in the upper right is already alive, if B 'a', then W 'b'. Black's jump at 'c' is a very big move.

Lee Changho is in deep thinking.];B[hi]
;W[ng];B[gh];W[hg]LB[kl:a]C[White already paid a price in order to make life.

Now making the knight's move at 'a' to attack White is still a good point.];B[lf];W[lg];B[me];W[mf];B[kf];W[lc];B[ld];W[kc];B[jc]

;W[kl]C[W106 took White about 33 minutes.];B[km]C[Lee Changho won the champion by 3:1.])
