(;B[bc]LB[ee:a][cb:b][bb:c][ec:d][db:e][cf:f][bd:g][be:h][ad:i][fg:j][pp:k]C[B11 is a good move according to the current situation. If Black plays as the joseki, B 'a', W 'b', B11, W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f', W 'g', B 'h', W 'i' and B 'j', this way locally both sides are acceptable, but White takes sente to grab the last empty corner at 'k', Black's tempo seems slow (see var a).];W[ee];B[fd]
;W[hd];B[fe]LB[ge:a][ch:b][pp:c]C[The turn of B15 is a vulgar play. Black should make the diagonal's extension at 'a', forcing White to defend at 'b', then Black  gets to play at 'c' to take the enticing empty corner.];W[ef];B[ff];W[eg];B[kd];W[hf]LB[if:a][gh:b][dj:c][fg:d][ie:e]C[W20: For White to get out with a knight's move at 'a' is lighter. If Black plays at 'b', White still can defend at 'c'; If Black tenukis, White's turn at 'd' will be still very big. In the game, after the jump of W20 and the peep of B 'e', White connects and becomes heavier.]
;B[ie];W[he];B[gg];W[hg];B[gh];W[dj];B[jh]LB[pp:a][od:b]C[B27 is unreasonable. Black should take the empty corner at 'a', if White approaches the corner at 'b', then Black can jump out and fight with White.];W[hh];B[hi];W[kf]C[W30 is the vital point.]

(;B[jg]LB[jf:a][kg:b][je:c][ig:d][ke:e]C[B31: Black is painful. Black should play at 'a', but White can wedge at 31, then B 'b', W 'c', B 'd' and W 'e', Black is hard to handle (see var a).];W[ii];B[ih]
(;W[fb]LB[db:a][eb:b][ec:c][hb:d][cb:e][jf:f][if:g][jd:h][id:i][je:j][ic:k][jc:l][hc:m][gc:n][ig:o][ib:p][gd:q][od:r]C[W34 is a wrong sequence play. Kong Jie said, White should first stand at 'a' to exchange for B 'b', then W 34, followed by B 'c', W 'd', B 'e', W 'f', B 'g', W 'h', B 'i', W 'j', B 'k', W 'l', B 'm', W 'n', B 'o', W 'p', B 'q' and W 'r', by sacrificing, White would have taken the lead at one stroke.]

;W[jd]LB[jf:a][ik:b][pp:c][od:d]C[W48: White should first push at 'a', Black needs to reinforce at 'b', then White can net at 48, B 'c' and W 'd', White would still take the lead.];B[ke];W[jf];B[je];W[if];B[ji]LB[ik:a][jk:b]C[B53 is a bad move. Black certainly should atari at 'a'. In the game, Black takes with B53 and White is left with the severe jump at 'b', Black has incurred a big loss.];W[md]

(;B[lb];W[lc];B[mc]LB[me:a][lf:b][ic:c][hb:d][nd:e][nc:f][od:g][pb:h][mh:i]C[B59 and B61 are no good, after being sealed off by W 'a' and W 'b', Black is painful. With B59, Black should first strike at 'c', then W60, B 'a', W 'd', B 'e', W 'f', B 'g', W 71, next Black can play at either 'h' or 'i', Black would have built a big moyo (see var a).];W[me];B[ld]
;W[lf];B[mf]LB[od:a][oe:b]C[B65 is the losing move. After being separated by W 'a' and W 'b', Black has to make life grievously on the second line, damaging both the side and the corner, Black has suffered a big loss.];W[od];B[nf];W[oe];B[nb];W[pc];B[pb];W[qc];B[jc];W[id]
;B[hb];W[ic];B[lc];W[ib];B[oc];W[qe];B[mh]LB[qb:a][lh:b][rc:c][hl:d]C[B81 is a bad move. At any rate, Black should crawl at 'a', followed by W 'b', B 'c' and W 'd'. Although this way the game would be still to White's advantage, but the outcome of the game would be still not decided.];W[qb]LB[qa:a]C[W82: Black takes advantage in sente, later on W 'a' is still sente, White's corner profit is huge, Black has lost a lot of points.]
