;B[cq];W[dq];B[cp];W[do];B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[eq];B[cn];W[qn]LB[qo:a][mq:b]C[W16: After the joseki, if White plays at 'a' instead, then Black will make the two-space extension at 'b', White would feel snubbed.];B[qp]
;W[pj];B[qh];W[nc]LB[qk:a][nq:b]C[With W18 and W20, White stresses on speed. I think White should make the two-space extension at 'a', then B19 and W 'b', forcing Black and initiating a fight as well.];B[pc];W[kc];B[kq]C[B23 is an excellent point.];W[on];B[fp];W[dn];B[cm]
;W[fn];B[ko]LB[gn:a]C[B29: Black can also attach out strongly at 'a'.];W[hq];B[pl]TR[dn]C[B31: For Black to invade on the right side is also playable, because White has already played the damaging move of the marked white stone.];W[op]LB[ol:a]C[W32 is a mischief-making move, White should attach at 'a'.];B[po]C[Black forces an exchange with the diagonal's extension of B33, Black is favorable.];W[pn];B[oo]
;W[no];B[nn];W[nm];B[mn];W[ol];B[fc]LB[rq:a][qo:b][rj:c][qe:d][qf:e][in:f][ho:g][ir:h][kr:i]C[But B41 breaks away from the main battle field! Because of the severe tactic of the invasion of W 'a', Black should reinforce at 'b', then W 'c', now the invasion at 'd' or 'e' is already not too severe, then Black can make the knight's move at 'f', followed by W 'g' and B 'h', Black will take advantage in sente on both the upper and lower side and would have also completely prevented White from playing the tesujis at 'a' and 'i', then Black can block at 41, this way the situation would be simply to Black's advantage.]
;W[rq];B[qo];W[ro];B[rp];W[sp];B[rn];W[so];B[qq];W[rm];B[rr]C[From W42 to B51, White takes advantage in sente.];W[kr]C[W52 is a good tesuji!];B[jq]LB[co:a][jr:b]C[B53: Because of the ko threat of the push at 'a', Black couldn't hane underneath at 'b'.]
;W[jr];B[fr]LB[lq:a][lr:b]C[Although Black counterattacks with B53 and B55, but the hane of W 'a' is too big! The proper move for B55 is to hane at 'b'.];W[lq];B[go]LB[gn:a]C[B57 and B61 are both bad moves, with B57 Black should attach out at 'a' instead.];W[gn];B[ho];W[ln];B[jo];W[mo]

;W[lp];B[hr]C[Through B77, Black ends in gote again, Black already sinks into a desperate situation.];W[hc];B[cc];W[dc];B[cd];W[de];B[db]LB[ce:a][df:b][oe:c]C[B83: Black should crawl at 'a', after White extends at 'b', Black can tenuki and grab the vital diagonal's point at 'c'.];W[eb]
;B[cb];W[ec];B[cf];W[qe]C[The invasion of W88 is severe!];B[pf];W[qf];B[pg]LB[qg:a][rc:b][pe:c]C[B91: Black should hit at 'a', then W 'b' and B 'c', this way White is relatively painful.];W[rc];B[rb]

;B[sq];W[sn];B[oq];W[co];B[bo];W[bp];B[bn];W[mb]C[But when White plays the hane of W150, the game is still to White's advantage.];B[lc];W[lb];B[kd];W[jd];B[ke]

;W[hf];B[pi];W[kh]C[In the game, after W166, White has played one questionable move after another.];B[lg];W[lh];B[mh];W[mg];B[mi];W[oi];B[oh];W[qi];B[ph];W[md]
