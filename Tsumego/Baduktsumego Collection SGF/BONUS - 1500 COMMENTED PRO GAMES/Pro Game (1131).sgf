;B[ep];W[fq];B[em];W[df]C[White is able to make the knight's move with W22 and can be satisfied.];B[cc];W[cb];B[bd];W[bc];B[cd];W[cg];B[bb];W[ba];B[ab]
;W[eb];B[bf];W[hp]LB[jc:a]C[W34: White also wants badly to make an extension at 'a'.];B[ic];W[qj];B[qh];W[po]C[Through the knight's move of W38, White's opening is fast.];B[de]C[The push of B39 is the follow-up maneuver with the extension of B35.];W[dj]LB[ej:a][fj:b]C[W40: White elects to handle separately, however White can consider to make the high extension at 'a', in the game after the cap of B 'b', White feels a little restricted.]

;W[oj];B[pk]LB[nm:a][nn:b][nl:c]C[B55: For Black to jump at 'a' is better, in the game after White's cap at 'a', Black can only push at 'b', then clamp out at 'c', it seems a little crude.];W[pj];B[oh];W[nm];B[on];W[mo];B[nn];W[mn];B[nl]

;W[kg];B[mh];W[kh];B[mq]C[B91 is the biggest point on the board.];W[kq];B[pq];W[pp];B[oq];W[qr];B[op]LB[qm:a][mp:b][iq:c][kr:d][lp:e]C[The turn of B97 is the losing move! After White attaches at 'a', Black is very painful, Black is reluctant to cross over, but in the game, to prevent Black from crossing over, White already takes a lot of advantage in sente, then White gets to hit at 'b', in order to obtain sente Black still has to exchange B 'c' and W 'd', after this sequence, White is favorable. With B97, Black should get out with the diagonal extension at 'e', this way this would be still an even game.]

Now on the board the situation is already about even, Cho Chikun (Black) couldn't give komi and has to concede defeat.];B[mb]
