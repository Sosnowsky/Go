Copyright by gogameworld.com and weiqi.tom.com.];B[qd]C[Yoda Norimoto finally advanced to the Fujitsu Cup final, and he won the semi final game beautifully, I thought he would win the champion this time, but he lost regrettably in the final.];W[dc];B[pq];W[oc]C[The corner-approach of W4 enters into Korean "territory", this is perhaps one reason of Yoda's defeat. Relatively this situation is not what Yoda is good at.];B[md]

;B[jd]C[Through B19, Black has nothing to complain, it seems the play of W10 is questionable, White should pincer tightly on one line higher.];W[cf]C[Gu Li: W20 is a huge move, White becomes thick and is also left with the tactic of killing Black's corner by a ko.];B[bf];W[cg];B[bg];W[bh];B[ci];W[ch];B[qn];W[kq]LB[jp:a]C[W28: For White to make the high extension at 'a' instead more fits into White's earlier fighting strategy. In the game Black makes the diagonal and presses White on a low position, the thickness at the top can't be easily utilized.];B[jp]C[Gu Li: B29 is a good move, showing Park YuongHoon excellent positional judgement: taking the whole game into consideration.]
;W[kp];B[jo];W[ir];B[ko];W[mp];B[lo];W[nq];B[nn];W[me]LB[qc:a][rc:b][qb:c]C[W38 is territory-damaging, attaching at 'a' is normal, next B 'b' and W 'c', but White is worried that Black may form a big moyo on the right side.];B[le]
;W[mf];B[lf];W[mg];B[nd];W[od];B[qc];W[lg];B[nb]LB[ph:a]C[B47 is a questionable move, Black should strength by jumping at 'a', waiting to see how White reinforces himself, then decide how to proceed.];W[nc];B[mc];W[ob];B[pi]LB[mb:a][kg:b][pg:c][of:d][bp:e]C[Gu Li: B51 is a slow move, Black should connect at 'a', White most likely will still jump to 'b', then Black can double up at 'c', White can only double at 'd', next Black can reduce at 'e'.]
;W[ag];B[ae];W[oo];B[qp];W[jg];B[mb];W[of]C[In the game, after W58, Black takes tenuki, but Black is always short of one move here, locally Black fails in the fight.];B[bp]LB[pm:a]C[However, Black takes tenuki to reduce first alertly on the left side with B59, because White has the tactic of flying out at 'a' on the right side, Black is hard to answer there.];W[pg];B[qg];W[qf]
;B[rf]LB[rg:a][qh:b][ph:c]C[The correct play of B63 is to stand at 'a', but just this move leads White to play the slow moves at 'b' and 'c'.];W[cn];B[bn];W[co];B[bo];W[cm];B[cq];W[qh];B[rg];W[ph]LB[jk:a]C[With this move, White certainly should take the vital point in the center at 'a'! This way White would have a big moyo in the center and also threatens Black, it is hard to believe that Yoda surprisingly ignores this vital point in the game!]
;B[il]C[After Black occupies the excellent point with B73, White is already very hard to win the game, because White has to enclose a huge territory in the center in order to keep balance in territory with Black.

After this move, it is time for noon break.];W[kl];B[hp]C[With the sequence following B75, Black starts to become very conservative.];W[gl]LB[hc:a][eb:b]C[Gu Li: W74 and W76 are not good, White should play at the top, for example invading at 'a', since W 'b' is sente, Black can only make life in gote, then White comes back to enclose the center with W74 and W76.];B[bm];W[cl];B[db];W[eb];B[hc]LB[hl:a]C[The strangest moves are B79 and B81, Black certainly should hit at 'a', this way White's territory is definitely not enough.]
;W[pm];B[qm];W[ik];B[eq];W[im];B[bl];W[ck];B[nl];W[or]C[With the sequence from W84 to W90, White's situation takes a better turn.];B[lk];W[ll];B[ml];W[mn]LB[pk:a]C[W94 is unnecessary, White should jump out at 'a'.]
;B[jl]C[The play following B95 is accurate, White ends in gote, it is not to White's advantage.];W[jm];B[kk];W[jk];B[km];W[lm];B[ln];W[hl];B[mm];W[kn];B[mo];W[no];B[hf]

White should jump to 'a' instead or make the knight's move at 'b', after obtaining sente, then attach at 'c', on the right side when Black plays the endgame with the attachment at 'd', White's clamp at 146 to settle the shape cleverly is effective, this way White would win the game by a small margin.]

;W[qk];B[nj];W[mi]LB[pl:a]C[W160 and W162 are the final losing moves. With W160, White should play at 161, W162 should be at 'a' instead.];B[oq];W[mr];B[on]C[After B165, Black wins the game for sure.];W[po];B[pn];W[kc];B[jc];W[pj]
