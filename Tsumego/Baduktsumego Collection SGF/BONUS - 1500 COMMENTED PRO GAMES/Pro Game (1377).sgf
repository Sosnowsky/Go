Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[Recently Lee Changhao often plays small points, it  has been said that he has done some new study.];W[pq];B[dd];W[dp];B[qo]
;W[op];B[ql];W[fc];B[id];W[oc]C[After the corner-approach of W8, White takes tenuki again to approach Black's small-point corner, which is a opening trend.];B[ld];W[cf];B[fd];W[cc];B[ec];W[cd];B[pc]LB[gd:a][fe:b]C[B15: Normally when there is no exchange of W 'a' and B 'b', Black will elect to block at 16, in the game Lee Changho obviously thinks that if Black is able to make the diagonal of B17 Black is not bad.]
;W[qj];B[od];W[qg];B[jq];W[gc]TR[ld][id]LB[qp:a][po:b][lq:c]C[The extension of W22 is the losing cause of this game, here Black doesn't reinforce, from state of mind, White wants to extend out with W22, but because Black's marked stones on the right is already very thick, the extension of W22 seems too early, the only purpose is to destroy territory, the value is not too big. White should make the diagonal extension at 'a', next B 'b' and W 'c', this is the big point.];B[eb];W[gd];B[fe]
;W[ge];B[ff];W[ie];B[jd];W[gg]LB[hg:a]C[The jump of W30 is the losing move! The original move is to make the knight's move at 'a', although escaping one lonely group is not good, but White can wait for a chance slowly.];B[gf];W[hf];B[hg]C[After Black pushes and cuts with B31 and B33, White collapses!];W[ig];B[hh];W[gh]
