;B[cn];W[fq];B[bp];W[cq];B[ck];W[fc];B[qm];W[qg];B[oq];W[kq];B[bd];W[cc];B[cf]C[Today, the opening up to B19 is steady, the big points are basically all taken, since White is relatively careful. Black can defend two big corners on the right side and also has split the left side, Black can be satisfied.]
;W[ci]C[The invasion of W20 is inevitable.];B[ef];W[ei];B[ek]C[B23 is the key for thickness and thinness, here Black is not fearful of fight.];W[dg];B[df];W[gf];B[ge]C[Black attaches out strongly with B27, the play of W26 is clearly not to White's advantage.];W[hf]LB[fe:a]C[W28: If White plays at 'a' to fight, White is not good, since White's three stones on the left are too weak.];B[fe]C[Through B29, the reason why White fails in the opening is perhaps W16, I feel, W20 is bigger than W16.]

;B[gc];W[gb];B[fd];W[fb];B[hb]C[Through B47, Black has more territory and White has more potential, Black is not bad.];W[fm]C[When B47, White at the top already has no good answer, if White simply encloses territory, White's territory is definitely not enough, so White messes up Black with W48, which is the only unknown factor, this is the best timing. Here the fight is very important and will impact the whole game.];B[fn];W[dm];B[dn];W[fl];B[bl];W[hm]
;B[hn];W[in];B[ho]C[Through B57, both sides have no unreasonable request, so they have made compromise on the left side. In this situation, I like to play Black, but it is still a very long game.];W[hq];B[jp];W[im];B[jq];W[io];B[kp]C[Through B63, it leads to a simple exchange. Since the value of W62 is not big, I feel Black gains a lot of territory in this exchange. Now, the key for the situation is how much potential White has in the center. Black is easier to play.];W[bo];B[co];W[bq]
;B[bn];W[np];B[nq];W[mq]C[W68 and W70 are strong moves, Black is not easy to kill strongly.

After this move, it is time for noon break.];B[mr]C[Since Black couldn't kill White, Black tolerates temporarily with B71.];W[qo];B[po];W[lr]C[It seems, the purpose of W72 is, after taking advantage, White hangs with W74 and initiates the ko fight.];B[gr];W[gq];B[kr];W[lq]
;B[jr]C[But White didn't notice Black's tactic of B77 and B79? It seems White is very difficult now.];W[pn];B[qn];W[nr]LB[mo:a][mp:b][nn:c][on:d][pq:e]C[After meditating for a long time, White plays W80 and W82, which are ignored by most people and too severe! After study, still can't find a way for Black to handle!

If B 'a', then W 'b', W 'b', B 'c' and W 'd', since White has the good squeezing move at 'e' in the corner, Black can't tight liberty at the top. Therefore, at any rate, Black can't seal off White, however if Black can't seal off White and is being separated, Black will incur loss of 15+ points. This way Black will be in a very bad situation.

When W80, if Black can take time and fight out the purpose of this move (since it is a very damaging move), Black can definitely find other choices with B81 to make sure Black wouldn't get separated.];B[mo];W[mp];B[nn];W[on]
;B[or];W[oo];B[ns];W[pl];B[ql];W[lo]C[The process in the game is almost same as expected. Among them, W92 is steady, in this fight White gains a huge profit at the bottom. With just one move, White becomes very thick plus 5-6 points' territory. And on top of that, White seals off Black on the right side, Black's situation quickly takes a very bad turn.];B[ls];W[qk];B[ro];W[ln];B[ig]C[Black must reduce White's territory in the center to within 20 points in order to have a chance to win, but this is almost impossible.];W[if]
;B[li];W[mg];B[ii];W[jg];B[gj];W[fj];B[gh]C[Black's play from B97 to B105 is very strong, now White only wants to take some advantage by intimidating Black, no need to kill strongly.];W[hj];B[lg];W[lf];B[mf];W[ng];B[kf]
;W[le];B[kg];W[ke];B[jh];W[hh];B[hi];W[gk];B[hg];W[gg];B[jf]C[Through B121, Black is alive in the center, but White also becomes thick, Black in the upper-left corner is too painful, Black is still not good, and now it is White's turn, White's territory is still about 20 points.];W[ic];B[jd];W[ib]
;B[fh];W[fg];B[lc];W[mc]C[Park YuongHoon advanced to the final four, which will take place on 9/1.])
