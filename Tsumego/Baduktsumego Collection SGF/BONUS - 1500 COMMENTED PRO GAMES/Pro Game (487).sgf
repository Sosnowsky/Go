Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[pd];W[dc]C[Peng Quan 7p takes White. Before this game, Peng Quan already won consecutive-win prize of 10 million Won, and after that, he will win 10 million Won for each additional win.];B[dq];W[pp];B[ce]
;W[do];B[cm];W[cq];B[cr];W[cp];B[gq];W[dm];B[dl];W[er];B[dr];W[eq];B[es];W[ep]C[W12 to W16 are new, Wang Lei 8p once saw it in national games but had no deep study.]
;B[fr];W[cn];B[em];W[bm];B[dn];W[cl];B[jq];W[dk]C[Through W26, Chang Hao thinks, Peng Quan shouldn't hesitate to take the ko now. In the game with W26, it seems to make the ko heavy but White also has some comprehension, since first White already makes one-move loss, and then fight the ko and gives the initiative to the opponent, this is clearly a losing deal.];B[cc];W[cb];B[bn];W[dm];B[dd]
;W[ec]C[W32 is not good, White should take B13.];B[cm];W[co];B[qp]C[The direction of B35 is correct, Liu Xing thinks, if Black attaches the corner from the other side, White also can only extend, no better than real game.];W[pq];B[qq];W[po];B[qo];W[pn];B[qn];W[pm];B[bb]
;W[el];B[db];W[eb];B[ca];W[ic];B[ql]C[Through B49, Black takes advantage in the lower-right corner and also gains some profit in the upper-left corner.];W[kq];B[kp];W[jr];B[lq];W[kr];B[iq];W[lr]
;B[lp]LB[mq:a]C[B57 is loose, Luo Xihe 9p thinks, Black should extend at 'a', White can only crawl on second line. After crawling with three moves, Black can hang at the top, this way Black's situation is much better. In the game, White gains advantage.];W[mq];B[mp];W[nq];B[kc]C[Through B61, Black takes initiative.];W[hp]LB[jp:a][jo:b]C[W62: Chang Hao suggests, for White to cut at 'a' is better, waiting for Black to capture at 'b', then strike with W62, this way Black will have less choices.];B[gp];W[ho];B[ir]
;W[jo];B[jp];W[go];B[bq]C[Through B69, Black makes compromise, White takes sente and it is huge.];W[nc]C[W70: Peng Quan today is eager to fight, now the situation is very complicated and the game is good to watch.];B[pc];W[ne];B[ke];W[ie];B[kg];W[ng];B[qf]
;W[pg];B[if]LB[hc:a][bs:b]C[Yang Shihai 8p thinks, B79 is not relentless enough, to attach at 'a' is very severe. Black locally at the bottom is still not alive, White can kill at 'b' later on. Of course, so far it is not urgent for Black.];W[hf];B[ig];W[je];B[kf];W[pf];B[qg];W[qe]C[Through W86, high hands in Chinese Go Association think, White's situation is not bad.];B[re]

;W[rj];B[rl];W[qh];B[rh];W[ri];B[sh];W[ed]C[Through W120, Yang Shihai 8p thinks, White is very favorable, Black loses for sure.];B[of];W[nh];B[fm]C[B123: Black starts to exert power.];W[dm];B[fo]
;W[gl];B[fp];W[hk]C[W126 and W128: White easily negates Won SeongJin's attacking tactic, the game already enters into Peng Quan's tempo.];B[jj];W[lh];B[fl];W[fk];B[gj];W[gm];B[eo];W[hj];B[gh];W[ii]
;B[hg];W[gf];B[ji];W[ch];B[fj];W[gk];B[ej];W[ek];B[pr];W[or];B[qs]C[The purpose of B147 and B149 is threatening White's group at the bottom. However, although White is being surrounded by Black, but the top is still open and White can also initiate ko at bottom. So, White is easy to handle.];W[df];B[ms]
;W[np]C[Through W152, Yang Shihai thinks, White is even leading on the board.];B[os];W[mr];B[bg];W[bh];B[cg];W[dg];B[jl];W[kk];B[jk];W[mn];B[dp];W[de]
