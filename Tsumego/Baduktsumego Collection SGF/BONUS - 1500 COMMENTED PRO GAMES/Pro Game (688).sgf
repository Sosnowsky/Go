Source: Sports Weekly,
Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[pd]C[In this game, Takao Shinji 9p played very well in the first half, but his play was loose in the second half, which cost him the game.];W[dd];B[qp];W[dq];B[oq]
;W[qj];B[do];W[co];B[cn];W[cp];B[fc];W[cf];B[dm];W[fq];B[ci]C[B1 to B15 is steady.];W[qf]LB[jc:a]C[W16 is trend, generally White will pincer at 'a'.]
;B[nd];W[jc];B[qh];W[db]LB[cc:a][hc:b]C[When B19, W20 taking tenuki is one strategy. If I were Black, I will elect to make knight at 20 with B19, waiting White to take 'a', then B 'b'. In the real game, after W18, W20 appears powerful.];B[qe];W[qm];B[ge];W[nb]C[W24 invading in second line is interesting.];B[nc];W[je]
;B[dg]C[B27 is very big, here if White sticks head out, two stones B11 and B23 will appear very thin instantly.];W[cg];B[ch];W[qc]C[W30: White is alert.];B[re];W[ob];B[lc];W[mb];B[kd];W[hc];B[lb];W[rc]C[Through W38, White easily takes the corner. These several moves show Takao Shinji's style, his play is light and fast, he is clear about overall configuration.]
;B[pl];W[ql];B[pj];W[pk];B[ok];W[qk];B[pi];W[ol];B[nl]LB[nk:a]C[The original move of B47 is to retreat at 'a'. In the game, Park YuongHoon 9p worries White may take sente strongly. But it seems Black's play is not natural. Black is thick, White is solid and easier to play.];W[om];B[nm];W[nk]
;B[oj];W[on];B[de];W[ce];B[ed];W[dc];B[jd]C[B57: Black seems to have no other choices, since Black already doesn't know where to fight. The outcome of the game will be subject to how much territory Black can enclose in the center.];W[id];B[ie];W[he];B[if];W[hf];B[hg]
;W[ig];B[jf];W[gg];B[hh];W[gf];B[gh];W[fh];B[fi];W[eg];B[eh];W[fg];B[gj];W[ei]LB[df:a][dh:b][ej:c]C[W76 is alert. If pushing-atari at 'a' first, then White makes atari at 76, Black definitely will not connect at 'b', but play counter-atari at 'c' instead.]
;B[dh];W[df];B[nn];W[ej]TR[ci][ch][dh][dg][eh]C[W80 and W82 are contradictory with each other. Takao Shinji perhaps has miscalculated. He thought W80 is absolute sente, Black wouldn't sacrifice five marked stones.];B[gl]C[But in the game, Park YuongHoon's judgment is clear, sacrificing five stones and enclosing big territory strongly with B81.];W[il]LB[jk:a][kk:b]C[W82: White can only turn back and reduce. I think, with W82 White should reduce at around 'a' or 'b'. In fact, Black's outside liberty is tight and Black's shape is not thick, White still has a lot of room for maneuver.]
;B[gp]C[The play of B83 is very "vicious", Black wants to kill White at big scale.];W[ij];B[jk];W[jj];B[kk];W[ik]C[Four moves W84 to W88 are heavy, foreshadowing later defeat.];B[jg];W[ck];B[el];W[ek];B[fk];W[fm]
;B[fl];W[cj];B[gq];W[no];B[mo];W[fp];B[fo];W[np];B[lp];W[nq]C[In the game, White dares not escape four stones and instead elects to conduct a territory race with Black.];B[or];W[ip];B[ho]
;W[lq]LB[kp:a]C[W108 is the last losing move! At any rate, White should attach at 'a' to fight desperately.];B[kp];W[kq];B[jp]C[In the game, Black's judgement is very accurate and Black retreats a little.];W[jq];B[iq]C[After Black cuts with B113, White already has no chance to win.];W[mn];B[ln];W[ir];B[hq];W[nr]
;B[ro];W[rh];B[rg];W[ri];B[pc];W[pb];B[sc];W[qg];B[pg];W[rf];B[pf];W[sd];B[sf]

;W[sh]C[The key for this game is situational judgement, both sides have huge territory and can only decide whether to attack or retreat by situational judgment. From the game process's perspective, Black's judgment is clearly more accurate than White's.];B[dl]C[The game 10 will take place on 11/27, Chen Yaoye vs. Park YuongHoon.])
