;B[do];W[co];B[cn];W[cp];B[fc];W[cf];B[qg]C[The opening from B1 to B13 is prepared by Wang Yuhui after study.];W[ec]LB[qm:a][jd:b]C[W14: The common move is to make two-space extension at 'a', Black will make extension at 'b', this will be Black's ideal shape. In the real game, White changes his move, showing Lee Sedol's bold style.];B[jd];W[fd]
;B[ql]LB[qm:a]C[B17: For Black to make extension at 'a' is more inexplicit.];W[oj]C[After White jumps out with W18, there comes two caps.];B[ol];W[og];B[qe]LB[qh:a]C[B21: Black is a little inconvenient, to double at 'a' is positive.];W[nc]C[Black gets to invade with W22, Black is difficult to handle.];B[ne];W[pb]LB[mj:a]C[As to B23, with W24 White still should jump out at 'a', it is imperative, this way, for now Black has no good way to deal with W22.]
;B[mj]C[The cap of B25 is severe, White comes under attack.];W[mg]LB[nk:a]C[However, the direction of W26 is strange, White should make diagonal at 'a' to probe Black.];B[nh];W[oh];B[ni];W[rf]C[The strike of W30 is tesuji.];B[oi]C[After Black pushes with B31, White connects with dame moves and is very painful!];W[qf];B[pf];W[of]
;B[qh];W[pi];B[pe];W[ph];B[nd]C[Through B39, Black is successful in the attack, but overall situation is still hard to judge.];W[qc]LB[mf:a]C[The correct sequence of W40 is to directly double up at 'a'.];B[rd]LB[ng:a]C[B41: Black wants to push and cut at 'a'.];W[mf];B[mc]
;W[nb];B[rb];W[rc];B[sc];W[kc]C[Although Black captures White's corner with B45, W48 is a good move.];B[mb];W[ld];B[md];W[le]C[Through W52, White becomes thick on the board, Black's situation is not that optimistic as imaged.];B[dn]LB[gd:a][ih:b]C[The sequence following B53 appears inevitable, in fact this is the first step to defeat. Black should press at 'a', then take the vital point in the center at 'b', this way Black contains White's development and also aims at White's big dragon, Black's situation is not bad.]
;W[dj]C[Following W54, White takes control of the center.];B[eq];W[er];B[dp];W[cq];B[fq];W[fr];B[hq];W[hk];B[gd];W[gc];B[ij];W[nk]LB[kb:a]C[The sequence following W66 is strange, perhaps White's judgement is wrong. White doesn't elect to play more positively, perhaps White seeks to create ko threats and waits Black to attach at 'a'.]

;B[ek];W[ck];B[bj];W[cl];B[fk];W[fj];B[dl];W[gj];B[bi];W[ch];B[bh];W[bg]C[Through W104, White completely becomes thick, Black is already in a losing trend.];B[kb]C[B105 just falls into White's plan.]
;W[jb]C[After W106, the game becomes Lee Sedol's individual show];B[jc];W[lb];B[lc];W[ka];B[kd];W[hb];B[kb];W[po]C[After this move it is time for noon break.];B[ib];W[pp];B[pq]
