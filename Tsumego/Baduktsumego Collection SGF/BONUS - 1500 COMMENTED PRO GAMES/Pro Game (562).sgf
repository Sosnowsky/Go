Translation:GoGameWorld.];B[qd]C[In the first round of this CSK Cup, Wang Xi 4p defeated Hane Naoki 9p and helped Chinese Team to beat Japanese Team. Hane Naoki just becomes new Kisei, his strength is unnecessary to explain

This game is chaotic from the beginning to the end. Due to the limitation of this article, we can only talk about some relatively important points.];W[dc];B[dq];W[pp];B[ce];W[od]
;B[ld]LB[oc:a][ed:b]C[The pincer attack of B7 is rarely seen, the common play is to attach at 'a' or play shoulder-hit at 'b'.];W[qe];B[re];W[pe];B[rf];W[qc];B[rd];W[ph];B[pc];W[oc];B[pb]
;W[hd];B[lg];W[lf]C[After Black jumps with B19, White immediately crosscuts with W20, showing young players' vigor and vitality.];B[kf];W[ke];B[le];W[mf];B[jf]LB[jd:a][gd:b]C[With the exchange of B25 and W 'a', Black loses a lot of variations, it seems Black should simply attach at 'b'.];W[jd];B[gd]
;W[he];B[ed];W[ec];B[gc];W[hc];B[ge];W[hf];B[jc];W[kc];B[kd];W[je];B[lc];W[mb]
;B[hb];W[ib];B[fb];W[ha];B[gb];W[ic];B[cd]TR[dc][ec]C[Through B47, an exchange results, Black clearly incurs a loss, because White obtains sente and White's shape is thick. However the two white stones captured by Black can still be used for other purposes, White establishes his superiority very earlier on.];W[do];B[cm];W[cq];B[cp]
;W[dp];B[co];W[cn];B[dn];W[bn];B[bq];W[cr];B[bo];W[eq];B[bm];W[en];B[dm]C[The sequence from W48 to B63 is joseki.];W[gf]
;B[ff];W[fg];B[ef];W[fo]C[But after the sente move of W64, White hangs with W68, White's advantage becomes more clear, showing Black's joseki selection following B49 is questionable.];B[lq]LB[nq:a]C[If B69 were played one line left to split the lower side, White definitely will block at 'a', although Black has the room for two space extension, but White can expand his center and right side moyo by attacking, Black is not good either.];W[jq];B[jp];W[iq];B[nq]LB[lo:a]C[Black makes one space extension with B73, White takes the opportunity to take the corner with the following W74 and W76. In an inferior situation, perhaps Black should jump to 'a' with B73, this way there would be more variations.]
;W[oq];B[no];W[pn];B[nm];W[kp];B[pl];W[nk];B[oj]C[The counterattack of  B81 is inevitable.];W[lk];B[oh];W[pg];B[mg];W[nf]
;B[pi]LB[qq:a]C[B87: Black has lost a winning chance, now Black can only enter the corner at 'a' to probe White in order to win the game.];W[ql]C[After the attachment of W88, Black's territory is not adequate.];B[pm];W[qm];B[qn]LB[on:a][po:b]C[B91: The original move is to hang at 'a', but after White connects at 'b', White would enclose all the right side and corner as territory, Black is no good, in the game, Black can only cut at 91 to seek variations.];W[on]LB[qo:a]C[W92: White definitely can't play atari at 'a'.];B[rn]
;W[nn];B[qk];W[pk]C[Next the cut of W96 is a good move.];B[ok];W[mm]LB[ol:a][om:b][mo:c]C[But W98 is questionable, if White makes extension at 'a' instead, B 'b', then White plays W98 in sente and hangs at 'c', this way it would lead to White's quick victory.];B[lo]C[With the sequence following B99, Black puts up a desperate resistance.];W[ol];B[pj];W[om]
;B[pk];W[mp];B[lp];W[np];B[jn];W[jo];B[io];W[ip];B[ko];W[im];B[kl];W[ik];B[kk]

;B[mn];W[li];B[jr];W[ir];B[kr];W[ni]LB[ns:a][mr:b][js:c]C[W134: If White plays hane at 'a', then B 'b' and W 'c', it would become a flower-viewing ko  for White, this way Black is very painful, rather dying than living, Black perhaps concedes defeat immediately.];B[ob];W[nb];B[br];W[ei]
;B[eg];W[eh];B[mj];W[lj];B[nj];W[mi];B[jp]C[After Black strengthens with B145, although this would be still a losing game for Black, but the game becomes close.];W[ch];B[fl];W[ek];B[fm];W[dr];B[fh]
;W[gg];B[oi];W[ng];B[qq];W[bf];B[fj];W[fi];B[gj];W[hi];B[be];W[gn];B[ej];W[jo]
