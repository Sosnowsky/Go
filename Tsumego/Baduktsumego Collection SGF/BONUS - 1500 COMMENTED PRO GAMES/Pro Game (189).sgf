Translation:GoGamdWorld.];B[pd]C[Black is Lee Changho 9P of Korea];W[dd]C[White is Kim JooHo 4P of Korea];B[qp]C[Comparing with both Hu Yaoyu and Xie He defeated Korean "Two Lee" (Lee Changho and Lee Sedol) in the Samsung Cup, this time Chinese players didn't meet with "Two Lee" but both lost to their opponents, the contrast is indeed too big. I was supposed to comment on one of Chinese players' games, however Chang Hao's game was already commented by Gu Li 7p, and Wang Lei made mistakes in the very beginning of the game and waged a bitter battle till the end and still lost by a big margin, relatively, the "two Ho" game is much brilliant.];W[dq]

;B[fo];W[ej];B[cs];W[aq];B[gr]TR[fr]C[In the lower left "big avalanche" joseki, White directly crawls with the marked stone, after the hane of B33, Black hanes again with B35, this kind of play, in my memory, is first seen in International competitions, from this point of view, the study spirit of Korean players is really worth praising.];W[gq];B[gp];W[hq];B[hr];W[ir];B[iq];W[hp]
;B[jr];W[ar];B[gn];W[ci]C[B45 looks like taking care of both sides, but the knight's move of W46 is working.];B[bi]LB[el:a]C[Because Black can't reduce liberty by the atari and cut at 'a', so Black has to play the attachment of B47 to manage and settle himself.];W[bk]C[But from the cut of W48 ...];B[bj];W[ak];B[cj];W[am];B[cg]C[... to W53, White is favorable.]
;W[ho];B[hn];W[jo]LB[jp:a]C[The jump of W56 is questionable, White should jump to 'a' instead.];B[jp];W[in];B[ko]C[In the game, Black gets to expand the right side with B57 and B59, Black takes a favorable turn.];W[im];B[gl];W[hl];B[gk];W[fm]
;B[el];W[em];B[gm];W[ch]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.];B[bh];W[ij]LB[eh:a]C[The ensuing W70 is again questionable, White should settle the shape by playing at 'a'.];B[hj];W[ii];B[fi]C[After being sealed off by the knight's move of B73, White doesn't gain much.];W[km];B[kn]
;W[lm];B[mn];W[qn];B[po];W[pn];B[mm];W[qj]LB[oo:a][op:b][rp:c]C[The extension of W82 looks like inevitable, but after Black simply extends at 'a', White loses all the follow-up maneuvers. White first should hane at 'a', Black most likely will counter-hane at 'b', then White makes the extension at 82, this is the right sequence, next no matter how Black to strengthen, the attachment of W 'c' is always effective.];B[oo];W[kp];B[lp]
;W[nc]C[With the sequence after W86, White starts pounding at Black's weakness.];B[qf];W[ei];B[eh];W[fh];B[eg];W[fg];B[ik]C[But Black gets out of trouble by sacrificing with B93.];W[ef];B[di];W[hk];B[gi]
;W[hi];B[gj];W[jk];B[ff];W[gg];B[fl]C[Through B103, Black instead captures White's five stones, Black is leading in territory. White needs to gain sufficient territory at the top in order to have a chance of winning.];W[fe];B[jc];W[hc];B[lc]LB[ic:a]C[B105 and B107 are Lee Changho's likes, however, with B105 it seems for Black to play at 'a' would be wider, also Black is still left with the tactic of escaping the captured stones in the ladder. This way it would be much simpler and clearer.];W[pc]
;B[qc];W[od];B[qd];W[kb]LB[qb:a]C[W112 seems relentless, in fact, it is a fast way to defeat! White should hane at 'a' instead, Black couldn't initiate the ko, the two stones on the left side can't be strengthened with only one move, the situation would be complicated.];B[lb];W[kc];B[kd];W[jb];B[md];W[of];B[pb]LB[oc:a]C[Black starts the ko with B119, although the ko is not heavy to White, but White doesn't have any room to retreat, what makes White painful is: even if White wins the ko fight, White can only connect at 'a' himself.]

;B[oc];W[rp];B[qq]C[In the process of ko fight, W134 is an asking move, the retreat of B136 is a very calm move!];W[pc];B[ql];W[pl];B[oc];W[lq];B[mq];W[pc];B[ne];W[oe];B[oc]

;B[ks];W[pc];B[fs];W[qb]C[White is being tied up and the ko becomes bigger. White's final losing move is W162, starting the ko, now White can only answer the ko, slowly tangling up with White on this ko, this way White may have a chance.];B[oc];W[qe];B[re];W[pc];B[ic];W[ib];B[oc];W[is];B[lr]
;W[pc];B[hd];W[gc];B[oc];W[ip];B[lp];W[pc];B[gf]TR[qb]C[Black uses the killing ko threats of B167, B173 and B179, forcing White to conduct an exchange, the gain and loss for both sides in the exchange is about equal, but the sacrifice of the marked white stone is damaging to White.];W[hf];B[oc];W[le];B[pc]
;W[nd];B[nb];W[mb];B[oa];W[mc];B[es]C[After Black takes with B189, White has already incurred a big defeat.];W[qk]C[Korean players again take the final four positions, all Chinese players are out of the tournament.];B[ap];W[ao];B[aj];W[al];B[cc]
