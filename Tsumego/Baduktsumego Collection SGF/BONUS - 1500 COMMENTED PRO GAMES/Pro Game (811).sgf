Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[Kong Jie meets the champion of last term Cho U, this is a very good game to watch.];W[pp];B[dc];W[cp]C[After Cho U won the champion, more people start to study his games, therefore he changes his unique style of approaching the corner directly with W4, aiming to avoid the specific pattern set up by somebody.];B[eq]

;B[fo];W[hr];B[fr];W[gn];B[cn];W[bn]C[In the lower-left joseki, the attachment of W24 is a novel play.];B[bo];W[co];B[bm];W[dn];B[cm];W[bp];B[fn]LB[an:a][em:b][do:c][dr:d][br:e]C[B31: Black wants to take at 'a' very much, this way W 'b', B 'c', W 'd' and B 'e', the variation is complicated.]
;W[ao]C[In the real game, White lives the corner in sente and can be satisfied.];B[gm];W[in];B[dm];W[ff];B[fd];W[qn]LB[nc:a]C[W38: For White to approach the corner at around 'a' instead is steady.];B[nc];W[ph];B[jo];W[io]
;B[oj];W[qj];B[he];W[di];B[eg];W[dg];B[ef];W[eh];B[fg];W[df];B[nh]C[Black forms a big moyo from B39 to B53, White is not good.];W[jd]C[The invasion of W54 is inevitable.]
;B[lc];W[hc];B[gb];W[jf];B[fh]C[After Black turns the head with B59, Black attacks two white groups, the game enters into Kong Jie's favorite situation.];W[od]C[W60: White ignores his two groups and still wants to provoke, indeed boldness of execution stems from superb kill! However, it is still an unreasonable move.];B[ne]C[B61 is an inevitable counterattack.];W[qc];B[rc];W[pc];B[re];W[oe]
;B[of];W[nd];B[md];W[qf];B[me];W[qe]C[White makes Black very thick from W62 to W72.];B[jh]C[After the cap of B73, White's three stones are hard to breathe.];W[bj]C[W74 first seeking life on the left side is a good calm move, White can only play this way in order to have a chance to win.];B[rf]LB[ie:a][rb:b]C[Black's sequence following B75 to live the corner is unreasonable! Black should strengthen at 'a', this way if W 'b', then Black can reduce White's moyo in the lower right corner, Black is favorable for the game. Black may think it is not easy to strengthen so take tenuki, but it is still unreasonable.]
;W[rg];B[rb];W[kc]LB[eb:a]C[The diagonal of W78 is the shape, Black itself is not thick, in the real game, Black really has no assurance of success by capturing cleanly at 'a'! Of course, this also doesn't fit Kong Jie's style.];B[ke];W[lb];B[mb];W[ld];B[mc];W[hd];B[jb];W[fc];B[ed]

;B[ki];W[lg];B[ig];W[if];B[lh];W[gh]LB[ei:a]C[The wedge of W106 is a good move! If Black knows this earlier, Black will atari at 'a' first with B75, then this wedge will not work. Go is so wonderful, how to think this deep?];B[ei];W[kg];B[mg]LB[jg:a]C[Because W 'a' is absolute sente, Black can't allow White to extend at 109, Black already can't kill White in the center.];W[li]

;B[gf];W[bc]C[Because Black's loss in the center is too big, even if Black kills White on the left, the game is still not to Black's advantage, besides, it forms a ko with the sequence from W164 to W176, Black is losing.];B[bb];W[ad];B[cc];W[ab];B[ac];W[dk];B[ek];W[bc];B[ha];W[el];B[fl]
