;B[nc];W[fc];B[cj];W[ch];B[cm];W[co];B[ej];W[jd]C[Through 14, it becomes a moyo-to-moyo race, which is rarely seen between them.];B[iq];W[lp];B[io];W[ln]LB[oo:a]C[The jump of W18 is too insipid, the large knight's move at 'a' is more powerful.]
;B[po]C[B19: Black can grab this spot to secure the corner and can be satisfied.];W[go];B[ko];W[lo];B[im];W[ll];B[lj]C[The cap move of B25 is a good move.];W[ok];B[qm]LB[nl:a]C[However, the jump of B27 is somewhat passive, and it is not fitting to Lee Changho's style, if it was me, I would try to separate White at 'a'.];W[kk];B[ik]
;W[kj];B[ii];W[ce];B[qe];W[mc]C[The attachment of W34 is unreasonable.];B[mb];W[nb];B[lb]LB[pj:a]C[B35 and B37: White has incurred an intense counterattack, White has no strong follow-ups and clearly suffers some loss. For W34 to make the diagonal's move at 'a' is the proper move.

;B[qj];W[ob];B[ld];W[pi];B[cc];W[bd];B[hf]LB[lh:a]C[B47 is a very interesting move, the usual play is to jump to 'a'.];W[kh];B[gc]C[The attachment of B49 is its follow-up tactic.];W[gd];B[hc]
;W[fb]LB[hd:a]C[The stand of W52 is the right move, if White presses at 'a', Black will hane underneath at 52, White has no way to kill Black.
];B[hd];W[ge];B[he];W[jf];B[fg]C[The knight's move of B57 is very solid, now it is a very close game, Black is a little thicker.
];W[fl];B[gk];W[qg]C[W60 is very big.];B[cq];W[dq]
;B[dg];W[qc]LB[cg:a][re:b]C[W64: if White blocks at 'a', Black will then stand at 'b', the values for these two spots are about same.];B[pc];W[rd]C[W64 and W66 are the follow-up maneuver of W60.

;B[bn];W[pr];B[qr];W[oq];B[pp];W[bq];B[bg];W[qb];B[qa];W[ra];B[pa];W[dl]LB[mg:a][em:b]C[W84: White really wants to play the knight's move at 'a' to enclose the center territory, but the jump of B 'b' is also very big, then White can no longer strike at 84.

;B[dm];W[em];B[gr];W[fr];B[hq];W[gp];B[lr];W[nr];B[ee];W[ed];B[mg]C[Through 95, it becomes a close game and Black is a little better, with regard to this situation, Lee Changho does best.];W[hl]LB[mh:a]C[W96 is the losing move. White has obviously realized that he is a little bit falling behind, so he is somewhat hasty, but this gives Black the chance to widen his lead, White still should calmly attach at 'a'.]

;W[np];B[no];W[nn];B[ps]C[From 97 to 113, Black has played very good, and White has suffered some losses in territory.];W[ag];B[ah];W[af];B[bh];W[pl];B[ql];W[mh];B[nh];W[mi]
;B[mq]C[The most important is that Black is left with the good point of 123, which delivers White the fatal blow.];W[nq]C[In order to save W74 and W92, White has to make the dumpling shape with W124, it is very painful.];B[mp];W[oo];B[mo];W[op];B[mn]C[Black has pushed for several times, and become very thick.
];W[pn];B[qn];W[mm];B[lg];W[os]C[W134: White initiates a ko fight and puts up the last-ditch struggle.]
;B[or];W[kc];B[lc];W[pr];B[kg];W[qs]C[W140: White eliminates the ko and tries to find an excuse to concede defeat.];B[gb]C[With the block of B141, Black has captured four white stones and achieved a huge profit, and Black on the right has no life and death problem, as a result, White is falling far behind in territory. It is interesting to notice that the first two games have exactly same number of moves.
