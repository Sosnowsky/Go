;W[qj];B[fq];W[dn];B[dr];W[cq];B[iq];W[qg];B[ql]C[As to the two-space extension of W12, Black still blocks with B13, it shows that from Gu Li's viewpoint White's two-space extension stones are still lonely and can be attacked.];W[jc];B[cl]C[B15 is a positive play.];W[di];B[em]
;W[fp];B[gq];W[dk]LB[df:a]C[W20 is a hasty move, White should defend at 'a'.];B[cc]C[B21 entering the corner is excellent, White is difficult to answer.];W[dc];B[cd];W[ce];B[be];W[bf];B[cf];W[de]
;B[bg];W[df];B[af];W[cg];B[ch];W[bf];B[ph];W[cf];B[qh];W[bd]C[From W32 to W38, it forms an exchange, Black gets to separate White's two-space extension stones and is favorable.];B[dl]C[Since Black can first play the sequence following B39, the loss in the corner is not so big.];W[ek]
;B[fn];W[bn];B[hn];W[qe]C[White dodges by attaching with W44.];B[pd];W[oe]LB[rd:a]C[W46: Black should first play hane at 'a', then jump out.];B[pe];W[pf];B[re]C[In the real game, after the atari of B49, if White initiates the ko, Black takes, White is not easy to find ko threats.];W[qn]LB[rf:a]C[So White invades with W50 to start fight, waiting for a chance to make the ko at 'a'.]
;B[qo]C[B51 is a strong move, not allowing White to turn the body around!];W[pn];B[np];W[pl];B[rl];W[rm]LB[qq:a]C[W56 is a bad move, White should enter the corner at 'a' and handle lightly, Black is relatively difficult.];B[ro]LB[rf:a]C[After B57, White is too heavy, at the top the ko at 'a' basically is gone.];W[qk];B[cr]
;W[en];B[fm];W[bk];B[bl];W[br];B[mm]C[When Black takes the vital point with B65, Black establishes superiority.];W[rk]LB[rh:a]C[White tolerates with W66, aiming to hane out at 'a'.];B[je]C[The cap of B67 is a good point, aiming at White's lonely stones on the right side from afar.];W[ie]LB[rh:a][ri:b]C[W68 enclosing territory is a questionable move, White should pull out at 'a', which is urgent, Black is difficult to decide whether to hane down at 'b'.]
;B[if];W[id];B[om]C[The peep of B71 is Gu Li's top-rated feeling.];W[jf]LB[ok:a][rf:b][rh:c]C[The cut of W72 is the losing move! White should calmly strengthen by hanging at 'a', the key in this situation is whether White can make ko at 'b' or hane at 'c'.];B[ol];W[pm];B[ig]C[After Black presses with B73, Black retreats with B75.];W[jg];B[jh]
;W[ih];B[ii];W[hh];B[kh]C[Next Black's sequence from B77 to B81 is a beautiful play to fight by sacrificing bravely.];W[hf];B[ri]C[When Black comes back to attack White with B83, Gu Li gives a full play to his style.];W[ok];B[pj]C[B85 is a strong move.];W[pi];B[oi];W[oj];B[qi]
;W[mj];B[ni];W[ml];B[ll];W[lk];B[nl];W[mk];B[lm];W[oo];B[op];W[jj];B[kk]C[Following B101 is one way street.];W[kj]
