Translation:GoGameWorld.];B[qd]C[The final of the 8th Korean Chunwon Title was held between two young players Choi Cheolhan and Won SeongJin, they are all famous players in CJK Ring Contest.];W[dd];B[pq];W[oc];B[md]C[B5: Black stirs a fight very earlier in the game,  they are young and aggressive.]
;W[qj]C[White elects to play the splitting move of W6, avoiding a direct confrontation.];B[od]LB[ql:a]C[B7: As to this, Black has the state of mind to check at 'a'.];W[qo];B[pm];W[oo];B[np];W[lp];B[no];W[on];B[qp];W[ro]C[After the approaching move of W8, up to the descent of W16 the local exchange comes to an end.]
;B[mn];W[ql];B[ip]TR[lp]C[B19: For Black to pincer the marked white stone is questionable, Black should consider to take the empty corner.];W[dq];B[co];W[gq];B[fp];W[fq];B[cq];W[cr];B[dp];W[eq]LB[nc:a]C[Next with the sequence from B23 to W28, it seems Black helps White to  reinforce, Black should simply strengthen at 'a'.]
;B[nc];W[ln]TR[ip]C[After White attaches out with W30, the marked black stone instead comes under attack, the fight is clearly against Black's original plan.];B[mm];W[lm];B[ll];W[kl];B[jn]C[Although the knight's peep move of B35 is the shape, ...];W[op];B[oq];W[jm]C[But with the sequence from W38 to W44, Black has incurred a big loss,  Black has no certainty of success on how to redeem his loss by attacking White.];B[kn]
;W[km];B[lo];W[ko];B[mo];W[iq];B[in];W[jp];B[hp];W[jq];B[kk]C[The double hane of B49 is the shape, and White needs to handle calmly.];W[im];B[hm];W[il]
;B[hl];W[lk];B[ml];W[jk];B[kj];W[hk]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.];B[gk];W[hj]C[Through W60, White already has a living shape, Black can't continue to attack White any more.];B[jj]C[B61: Black seeks the tempo of playing.];W[gj];B[fk];W[fj]
;B[ek];W[ej];B[dk];W[dj]C[From the turn of W62 to W68, White has nothing to complain.];B[fc];W[dc];B[hd]LB[fd:a][fe:b]C[Next after the corner-approach of B69, B71 is almost the losing move! After White presses at 'a', Black is hard to enclose territory, with B71 Black should simply jump to 'b', allowing White to invade.];W[fd];B[gd];W[fe]
;B[if];W[lc];B[mb];W[mq]C[W78 is an asking move before taking any action at the top.];B[qm];W[rm];B[pl];W[rk];B[pk];W[qh];B[rp];W[pp];B[nq]LB[oh:a]C[But Black has missed a good opportunity with B85 and B87! Among these two moves, one move should be played at 'a' to enclose territory.]
;W[ke]C[W88: White finally pulls out his lonely stone. Because Black himself is too thin, White has no assurance of success if trying to kill White.];B[jd];W[kg];B[ih];W[jh];B[ij];W[ik];B[hi];W[ng]C[In the game, White easily connects back with W96, Black is already losing!];B[fg]LB[cj:a]C[B97: Black is better to first play the hane at 'a'.];W[gh]
;B[gf];W[cj];B[ck]LB[dg:a]C[B101: Black certainly should counterattack by jumping down at 'a'.];W[eg]C[After White attach-seals off with W102, Black doesn't gain anything.];B[eb]LB[fb:a]C[B103: Black absolutely should make this diagonal's extension, otherwise White's clamp at 'a' would be huge!];W[kd];B[cb];W[db];B[da]
;W[bc];B[bb]LB[gp:a]C[B109: Black ends in gote, it is inexplicable, Black certainly should connect at 'a', after White pushes at 'a', Black's territory is clearly inadequate.];W[gp];B[bq];W[dn];B[cn];W[ne];B[me];W[ig];B[hg];W[lj]C[White just wants to strengthen himself with W116 and W118.]
;B[ki];W[li];B[fh]LB[kh:a][ii:b]C[B121: However, at any rate Black should play at 'a'! After White throws in at 'b' in sente, Black loses the game quickly.];W[ii];B[ji];W[kh];B[lf];W[nd];B[nf];W[kf];B[ii]
;W[oe]C[After W130, although the situation is a little complicated, but Black is always in an unfavorable situation.];B[of];W[pe];B[mc];W[pd];B[qc];W[ob];B[eh];W[ch];B[cg];W[dh];B[ph];W[oi]
;B[pi];W[pj];B[oj];W[ni];B[nj];W[qi];B[pf];W[qe];B[oh];W[nh];B[rg];W[rd];B[kb]
;W[jc];B[rf]LB[jb:a][jf:b]C[B157 at 'a' would be the correct move, this way White can create a ko by playing at 'b', although Black is no good, but Black perhaps would have more chances.];W[lb]C[After White pushes with W158, Black can only concede defeat.];B[sj];W[si];B[ri];W[rh];B[sh];W[rj];B[ma]
