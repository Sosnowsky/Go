;B[oc];W[pd];B[pc]C[Apparently Kong Jie is well prepared with this opening, he plays very fast in the first 30 moves.];W[qe];B[nc]LB[qc:a][nd:b][mc:c][le:d]C[B37: Black elects to play the big avalanche joseki, it is correct, if Black connects at 'a', next W 'b', B 'c' and W 'd', Black's position is too low on the whole board.];W[nd];B[md];W[qc];B[rd]
;W[qb];B[rc];W[mc];B[lc];W[rb];B[re];W[mb];B[nb];W[lb];B[pb];W[qf];B[rf]LB[ld:a][pa:b][oa:c][kb:d][sc:e]C[B53: If Black connects at 'a', next W 'b', B 'c', W53, B 'd' and W 'e', this is also joseki, but in this situation, Black's direction is not correct, in the real game, the crawl of B53 is just the right move.]
;W[kc];B[ld];W[kd];B[lf];W[qg]LB[of:a]C[W58: Normally White will jump to 'a'. In the game, W58 is a variation according to the surrounding situations.];B[ke];W[sb];B[qa];W[rg];B[ra];W[nf];B[id]
;W[ib];B[jd];W[jc];B[hb];W[hc];B[ic];W[jb];B[gc]C[Through B73, the variation is acceptable for both sides.];W[je]LB[ka:a][jf:b][qn:c]C[W74: White can also consider to simply make life at 'a'. Afterwards, Black will reinforce at around 'b', W 'c', this will lead to a steady situation.]
;B[he];W[if];B[lh];W[ka];B[ia];W[ma];B[hf]C[B81: Black takes chance to press out, White incurs loss on the left side.];W[ig];B[hg];W[ih];B[gi];W[lj];B[ki]
;W[hi];B[gj];W[ij]LB[ik:a][kj:b][hj:c][gk:d][kk:e][gh:f]C[The play of W88 and W90 is a little far-fetched. With W90 for White to make the knight's move at 'a' is still better, if Black presses at 'b', then W 'c', B 'd' and W 'e', this way White is still left with the cut at 'f', White also would be much thicker than the real game.];B[kj];W[gh];B[fh];W[fg]
;B[hh];W[jk];B[kk]LB[ik:a]C[The exchange of W96 and B97 is very painful, but White also has no other choice to prevent Black's attachment at 'a'.];W[gg];B[en]TR[fh][gi][gj]C[Black elects not to pull out the three marked stones directly in the center, but jumps with B99 instead, this is kind of mock attack.];W[kl];B[lk];W[fp]C[W100 and W102 are damaging moves! But in order to attack Black, White has to pay a price.]
;B[gq];W[gn]LB[gl:a]C[However, the shape of W104 is not right, this is also the root cause that leads to White's bitter battle later on. With W104 White can only cap at 'a' to separate two sides.];B[hm]C[After the shoulder-hit of B105, White's big group becomes thin.];W[gm];B[gl];W[jl];B[hn];W[ho];B[hj];W[ii];B[il]
;W[in];B[im]LB[jn:a][go:b]C[After Black wraps with B115, if White retreats at 'a', then B 'b', White has not follow-up tactic.];W[hk]C[White's sequence following W116 is also very far-fetched.];B[go]C[After Black cuts with B117, it seems White is not good.];W[fo];B[gp];W[fn];B[gk];W[ik];B[hl]
;W[ll];B[ml];W[mm];B[kn]C[B125 and B127 are good moves! If Black handles well here, White has no chance to win.];W[io];B[jp]LB[jm:a][nl:b][mk:c][ln:d][oj:e][ko:f][jo:g]C[But B129 is the losing move! Black should turn at 'a',  White can only atari at 'b', next B 'c', W 'd', B 'e', W 'f' and B 'g'! White is not good.]

;B[jq];W[iq];B[jr];W[lp];B[mo];W[ir];B[lr];W[fl];B[ei];W[is]C[The descent of W152 is a good move, White can extend one liberty, Kong Jie clearly has miscalculated.];B[ci]LB[js:a][mq:b]C[B153: If Black tightens liberty at 'a', White has the good diagonal at 'b', Black can't take care of both sides.]

;W[mf];B[mg];W[pi];B[nm];W[nn]LB[qi:a]C[In the game W184 is not simple and clear enough, if White connects at 'a' and reinforces White's big roup in the upper right corner to make life by playing at 'a', White already can win big, in the game after ko-living, Black is also not good.];B[om];W[oo];B[po];W[mn];B[ng];W[pf];B[le]
