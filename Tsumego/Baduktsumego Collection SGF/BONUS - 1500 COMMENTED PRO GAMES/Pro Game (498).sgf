;W[cf];B[kc];W[po];B[qm];W[ro];B[nq];W[qk]C[The sequence from W8 to W12 is Gu Li's unique play, so far it forms the same opening as in the game 2.
];B[fq]LB[pm:a][om:b]C[In the game 2, Zhou Heyang blocks the crossover at 'a' with B13. Today Zhou Heyang first varies.];W[cn];B[om]
;W[rm];B[qn];W[rn];B[qo];W[qp];B[pp];W[qq]LB[ql:a][oo:b][hq:c][iq:d]C[W22: White overly puts emphasis on the aji of W8, White should bump at 'a', after B 'b', White can obtain sente and gets to invade at 'c' or 'd' first.];B[ql];W[rl]
;B[pk];W[qj];B[pj];W[qi];B[jp]C[After Black settles the shape from B23 to B27, Black takes the big point with B29, Black's speed is faster, however it is still very remote for White to pull out W8, W22 is perhaps worth 15 points as endgame play.];W[od];B[pc];W[hc]C[White invades with W30 and W32, it is very intense.];B[fe]C[Sine ce Black is thick on the board, so Black elects to fight.];W[ec];B[fb];W[he]
;B[ef];W[ch];B[cc];W[cd];B[hg]C[B39 and B41 are consecutive good moves.];W[je];B[md];W[jc]LB[fd:a]C[W42 and W44 are also to prepare to wedge at 'a'.];B[kd];W[fd];B[eb]
;W[ed]LB[bc:a][dc:b][bb:c][gd:d][gc:e][ge:f]C[W48 is a little slow, White should consider to hane at 'a', if Black ataris at 'b', then W48 and B 'c', White is better than the real game in points; However if Black ataris at 'd', W48, B 'e' and W 'f', White also can fight.];B[bc]C[Black descends with B49, forming a best possible shape in the upper left corner.];W[jg];B[fo];W[dr];B[dm];W[dn]
;B[fm]C[B51: Black expands his situation, B53 and B55 are related good moves.];W[hq]C[The invasion of W56 is a game-deciding move.];B[eq];W[dq];B[hp]C[After this move, it is time for lunch break.];W[jj];B[ei];W[kl]C[W60 and W62 are vital points in this situation.];B[kn];W[iq];B[ip]
;W[lr]C[Afterwards, White starts to move with W64 and W66. White's play is just right, this is classical textbook for middle game fight.];B[lq];W[kq];B[mr];W[lp];B[mq];W[jr];B[kp]LB[gr:a]C[Black's sequence from B67 to B73 is steady, at the bottom White is clearly left with the diagonal at 'a' to make life, Black falls behind a little in the game.];W[oc]C[White blocks down with W74, to catch up desperately.];B[mf];W[pf]
;B[rf];W[pb];B[qb];W[nb]C[W78 and W80 are good moves.];B[pa]LB[rb:a]C[W81 are a must, otherwise White can clamp at 'a'.];W[oa];B[ob];W[db]C[The hane of W84 is damaging, but White also has no other choice.];B[dc];W[pb];B[qa]
;W[mh]C[Through W88, White's weakness in the center gets strengthened.];B[ob];W[pr];B[og]LB[or:a]C[B91: Black should block at 'a'.];W[of];B[ng];W[rg];B[qf];W[pg]C[The sequence from B91 to W96 is not to Black's advantage.];B[gr]LB[or:a][cj:b]C[B97: Black still should block at 'a', this way making a miai of B97 and 'b', Black must get one.]
;W[oq];B[op];W[or]C[White gets about 10 points in sente with W98 and W100, the difference between them becomes closer.];B[no];W[en];B[fn];W[hr];B[ms]C[White incurs a small loss in the exchange of W104 and B105.];W[dj];B[ej];W[dk];B[em]
;W[cm];B[hi];W[ih];B[hh];W[le]C[W114 is an intense game-deciding move.];B[ke];W[lf];B[kf];W[lg];B[jf];W[gd];B[me];W[ld]
;B[mc];W[lc];B[mb];W[lb];B[kb];W[pb];B[if]LB[la:a][na:b]C[B129: Black can't cross over at 'a', otherwise White will throw in at 'b' to initiate a ko.];W[oi];B[ob];W[nk];B[na]
;W[mm]C[White makes three knight's move in a row, the situation becomes very close.];B[qr];W[rr];B[af];W[er];B[fr];W[be];B[ae];W[ad];B[bd];W[ag];B[ac];W[bf]
;B[di];W[ci];B[jl];W[jk];B[km]C[Black grabs the middle territory with B149 and B151.];W[ol];B[pl];W[nm]C[W152 and W154 are asking moves.];B[qg]LB[oo:a][on:b]C[But under time pressure, Black makes a big mistake, Black surprisingly didn't see White's tactic of escaping by W 'a' and 'b'.];W[oo]
