;W[qj];B[de];W[ce];B[cf];W[cd];B[cn]C[Through B11, the opening is steady.];W[dk]LB[fq:a]C[W12: If I were White, I will elect to make the knight's move at 'a', the pincer of W12 is Lee Sedol's style.];B[fq];W[dn];B[cq]C[B15 directly entering the corner is very "cruel".];W[dq]
;B[cp];W[do];B[co];W[cm];B[bm];W[cl];B[dr];W[er];B[cr]C[Through B25, I like Black in this situation.];W[df];B[jc];W[nc];B[qf]
;W[pb];B[qc];W[hc]C[The sequence from W26 to W32 is almost inevitable.];B[md];W[oe]C[As to the knight's move of B33, W34 flying out is a good move at this juncture.];B[mc];W[od];B[pg]LB[pc:a][oc:b][qb:c][qg:d][ph:e][mf:f][pi:g]C[B37, I think, is questionable, Black should play at 'a', next W 'b' and B 'c', this is very big. If White plays at 37, then B 'd', W 'e' and B 'f', White's shape on the right is still not very complete, this way Black is not bad. Even if Black wants to stick his head out, Black should make the shoulder-hit at 'g', this is more efficient.]
;W[nf];B[lf];W[qb]C[White gets to crawl in the corner, Black's shape is not good.];B[ql]C[The pincer of B41 is inevitable.];W[jf]LB[jd:a]C[W42, I think, is a little loose, I will attach and press at 'a', Black's counterattack is not working.];B[hd]LB[id:a][ic:b][hb:c]C[B43 is a mistake, if White hanes at 'a' next, then B 'b' and W 'c', Black will be very dangerous.];W[gc]LB[id:a]C[But Lee Sedol's W44 is really inexplicable, originally in this kind of place, Lee Sedol will never miss the chance to counterattack at 'a', unexpectedly he elects to play the normal retreat this time.]
;B[je];W[ke]C[W46: White starts to exert power now, but it is already late.];B[kf];W[jd];B[ie];W[kd];B[id];W[kc];B[kb]C[B53 is a good move.];W[le];B[me];W[jb]

(;W[mb];B[ja];W[lc]C[Through W64, Black is successful in this fight, because White has missed a good fighting chance, now Black is favorable in the game. If White loses the game, W44 can be regarded as the losing move.];B[pi];W[pj];B[oj];W[qi]LB[pl:a][qm:b][rl:c]C[W68 is also a little unreasonable, White should attach at 'a', Lee Sedol may worry that Black blocks at 68, next W 'b' and B 'c', this variation is relatively common.];B[ok]C[After Black extends out with B69, White sinks into a more bitter battle.];W[rl]
;B[qm];W[ph];B[oi];W[oh]LB[qh:a][qg:b]C[W74 again is no good, now White can only connect at 'a', next B74 and W 'b', this is better than the real game.];B[qh];W[rh];B[qg];W[rg]LB[og:a]C[When White crawls with W78, only if Black pushes out at 'a', Black is already in an invincible situation.];B[rk]LB[og:a]C[The hane of B79 is no good, Black still should push at 'a'.]
;W[rf];B[og];W[nh];B[ng];W[mh];B[qe]LB[re:a][mg:b][lg:c][lh:d][kg:e][li:f][rd:g][rj:h]C[After B85, if W 'a', B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f' and W 'g', this way the situation is close. Moreover, White can also directly atari at 'c', Black already can't connect at 'e' and can only capture White at 'h', White takes two stones at 'e', this way Black can't seem to have any advantage. Now it is time for noon break, Lee Sedol can use this time to compare the pros and cons of these two approaches.

B79 is a very regrettable move.

Black has used 1 hour 35 mounties
White has used 1 hour and 7 minutes.]

;W[pq]C[W98: White attaches in the corner, here White wants to use it for some other purposes.];B[pr]C[B99 is the strongest counterattack.];W[ko];B[jo]LB[jn:a][op:b][nq:c][qq:d][pp:e][qr:f][or:g][rp:h][ro:i][sq:j][jl:k][np:l][mq:m][ef:n]C[B101: Black can also jump to 'a' strongly, this way it will be very complicated, Chang Hao probably feels his situation is not bad, he doesn't need to take such a risk. 

There are so many variations here, let me just give one example after B101: W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 'e', W 'f', B 'g', W 'h', B 'i', W 'j', B 'k', W 'l'  and B 'm', this way White lives one corner, then White extends at 'n', this variation, Yu Bin 9p thinks, would be another game, the outcome of the game is still hard to judge (see var a).]

(;W[km]C[With the jump of W102, White wants to eliminate Black's influence in the center.]

;W[pp];B[qq];W[np];B[or]C[The connection of B109 is very inconvenient, but Black also has no other choices, otherwise the aji at the bottom is very bad.];W[kn]C[After White connects with W110, if Black doesn't have any follow-up attack maneuver, then Black's attack here fails.];B[bl];W[bk];B[cj];W[ck];B[eq]LB[mo:a][mp:b][mn:c][kp:d][jl:e]C[B115 is slow, Black can only strike at 'a', next W 'b', B 'c', W 'd' and B 'e', this way although it is more difficult to kill than earlier, but if Black can't capture this white group, Black's territory will be inadequate.]
;W[qo]C[W116: White reinforces himself and also destroys Black's territory, it is very fierce and relentless.];B[on]C[The counterattack of B117 is inevitable, however Black is already one step slow, Black can't put too much threat on this white group, now Black's situation is severe.];W[nn];B[qd];W[rc]C[B119 looks like a move to gain more time, Black perhaps is already in overtime.];B[mp];W[om];B[pn];W[qr]C[W124 is a good move.];B[rr];W[rq]
