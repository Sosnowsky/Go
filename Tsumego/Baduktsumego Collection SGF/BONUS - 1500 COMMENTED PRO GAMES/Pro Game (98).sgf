Copyright by gogameworld.com and weiqi.tom.com.];B[pd]C[Luo Xihe takes Black, they met four times in the past, Luo Xihe all took Black (and lost all four games).];W[dd];B[qp];W[dp];B[fq]
;W[hq];B[oq];W[cn]LB[qj:a]C[W8: For White to split the right side at 'a' is also very common, the situation will be broken up. Since Luo Xihe likes territory, this is perhaps Lee Changho's strategy.];B[fc];W[cf];B[db];W[qf];B[pi]LB[qc:a][jq:b]C[Black plays two-space pincer with B13, the purpose is, if White enters the corner at 'a', Black can obtain sente and force at 'b' to expand the lower-right.];W[nc]C[W14: White destroys Black's intention.]
;B[pf];W[pg]LB[qc:a]C[W16: For White to enter the corner at 3-3 is common.];B[of];W[qd];B[qe];W[re];B[pe];W[rg];B[qc];W[rd];B[og];W[jd]C[The sequence from W16 to W26 is also one joseki, but in this situation this joseki is seen very rarely, this is Lee Changho's unique conception.]
;B[hc]LB[jq:a][ph:b][pc:c][qg:d][oc:e][rf:f][rc:g]C[B27: Black wants to forces at 'a', before forcing, Black can first settle the shape in the upper-right corner by B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f' and W 'g'.

B27 is also very big, but its speed seems slow.];W[ph];B[oh];W[qi];B[qj];W[ri]LB[rj:a][kq:b]TR[nc]C[The sequence from W28 to W32 appears crude, but in fact locally they are good moves to settle the pattern, making a miai of 'a' and 'b'. Now White is not fearful of invasion at the top, W14 (the marked stone) can be handled lightly.]
;B[rj];W[kq]C[After White gets to make two-space extension with W34, White's opening is successful.
];B[si];W[rh];B[dr];W[cq];B[fo]C[B37 and B39 are Luo Xihe's unique play, after this, both sides play very fast.];W[qq]C[W40 is an asking move.
];B[pp];W[ic]LB[ho:a][fm:b][dk:c]C[W42: The first feeling is to jump at 'a', it is very big, next if B 'b', then W 'c', threatening this black group.]
;B[hd];W[ld]C[W42 and W44 reinforcing the upper side are over-steady.];B[ho]C[After Black turns and caps with B45, White's two-space extension becomes thin.];W[gq]LB[ir:a]C[W46 is to guard against Black's strike at 'a'.
];B[fr];W[mq];B[ch];W[cc];B[cl]LB[cb:a][cr:b]C[B49 and B51 are smooth, making a miai of two crawls 'a' and 'b', Black must get one.]
;W[cb];B[cr];W[eo]LB[en:a]C[W54 is a good move to stick the head out, if White jumps to 'a', Black will push at 54, White's eye shape will be much worse.];B[gp];W[em];B[oc];W[nb];B[bf];W[be];B[lo]C[B61 is a good feeling, I feel Luo Xihe's situation takes a better turn.];W[ko]LB[or:a]C[The simple set pattern following W62 is surprising, if White attaches at 'a', Black is difficult to answer.]
;B[kn];W[jo];B[jn];W[lp];B[mo];W[io];B[in];W[hp];B[fn];W[en];B[ke]LB[dk:a]C[The strike of B73 is over-zealous, to make diagonal at 'a' is thick.];W[je]
;B[kc];W[kd];B[ib];W[jb];B[jc];W[kb];B[id];W[lc]C[Through W82, Black didn't gain much advantage, and this is not favorable to the center situation.];B[bm];W[hn];B[hm];W[go];B[fp]
;W[br];B[bp]LB[ek:a][bo:b]C[B89 is coarse and should be reserved, Black should simply make the knight at 'a', later on White can jump to 'b', White is not alive.];W[bo];B[ek];W[lh];B[oi];W[np];B[on];W[oo];B[pn]C[Through B97, Black is favorable for the game.

After this move, it is time for lunch break.]
;W[mi];B[nr]LB[or:a][pr:b][qr:c]C[B99 is big, if omitted, White can attach at 'a', next B 'b', W99, and B 'c', the difference is about 10+ points.];W[pr];B[kg];W[lg];B[kh];W[lf];B[mr];W[lr];B[rp]
;W[nj];B[ok];W[fk];B[gn];W[ho];B[gl];W[dk]C[W114 is tesuji to fix the shape.];B[dl];W[fm];B[gm];W[ej];B[el];W[fl]
;B[dj];W[di];B[cj];W[bg];B[ao];W[bn];B[cp]C[B125 and B127 is Luo Xihe's hidden tactic, Black takes endgame advantage, White is still not alive completely.];W[dq];B[an];W[cs];B[fj];W[ei];B[eq]
;W[ds];B[er];W[bq];B[gk]C[B131 and B137 are sente moves to seal off, White must strengthen to make life.];W[ci]LB[bh:a]C[W138 looks like miscalculation, if White strengthens to make life, Black blocks at 'a', the situation will be still slightly to Black's advantage.];B[dm]C[B139 is a very brilliant move. After Black pushes with B139, the game is suddenly over.  From this local variation, we can see Luo Xihe's calculation is very deep.];W[bj];B[ck];W[co];B[ap];W[hf]
;B[gi];W[gb]C[W144 and W146: White wants to kill the top side and makes the last-ditch effort, Lee Changho is not willing to concede defeat if not capturing that group.];B[gf];W[gg];B[fb]LB[hg:a][if:b][ff:c]C[B149: If Black cuts at 'a', next W 'b' and B 'c', White is not easy to kill Black.];W[ec];B[ed];W[ge]C[Through W152, Black unexpectedly can't live, Luo Xihe is a little careless in this area.];B[ff]
;W[he];B[dc];W[fd];B[eb];W[fh];B[ga];W[ha];B[ea]C[B159 and B161: Black can only make a ko like this, the situation has been turned around.];W[fa];B[bi];W[bh];B[ga];W[bk]

;W[fa];B[ca];W[bb];B[ga];W[ar];B[am];W[fa];B[ab];W[ce];B[ga];W[bl];B[cm];W[fa]
;B[qg];W[qh];B[ga];W[nq];B[gc]C[B197: Black can't continue to answer the ko threat, only if Black continues to fight the ko at the top, Black may still have a chance to live.];W[fa];B[fe];W[gd];B[ga];W[bs];B[do];W[fa];B[ba]
;W[ac];B[ga];W[dn];B[ep];W[fa];B[ie];W[if];B[ga];W[do];B[es];W[fa];B[jf];W[ga]LB[hg:a][kf:b]C[W218 is a mistake, White should play at 'a', B 'b' is not a ko threat, White will win this ko fight.]
;B[hg]C[B219 is the last chance.];W[ig];B[hh];W[ih];B[ii];W[ee];B[jh];W[ec];B[le];W[kf];B[ed];W[oj]C[W230 is the only ko threat, the atari in the lower-left corner is not a ko threat.]
;B[jg]C[Black eliminates the ko, the situation has been turned around again, Luo Xihe likely will win the game.];W[pj];B[ob];W[pb];B[me]C[B235 is a good move, later on White needs to capture by reducing liberty.];W[oa];B[pk];W[qk];B[rk];W[ql];B[rl];W[qm]
;B[rm];W[nl];B[ol];W[nm];B[nk];W[mk];B[om];W[ne];B[mf];W[nf];B[mg];W[pc]LB[or:a]C[Black can win the game only of Black connects at 'a' in the lower-right corner.]
