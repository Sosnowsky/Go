;W[ol];B[nm];W[jq];B[qh]TR[qj][qm]LB[mf:a][dj:b]C[B55 and B57: Black puts too much importance on White's weakness of the cut at 'a' and the two-space extension of the two marked stones, in this situation, the shoulder-hit at 'b' is the vital point.];W[cm]LB[cs:a][dj:b][fj:c][mf:d][nf:e][ng:f][of:g][kd:h]C[After the one-space extension of W58, Black needs to guard against White's hane at 'a'. If now Black makes the shoulder-hit at 'b', White definitely will cap at 'c' to counterattack; On the right side, if Black pushes at 'd', then after W 'e', B 'f' and W 'g', White can counterattack by playing at 'h', Black has no certainty of success.]

;W[oj];B[nk];W[ql];B[mf]LB[pi:a]C[The push and cut of B81 is a mistake, Black should peep at 'a', White on the right is not alive and Black can separate White into two lonely groups.];W[nf];B[ng];W[ro];B[rp];W[rh]C[W86 is a good tesuji!];B[rj]C[But the counterattack of B87 is also very severe.];W[og]
;B[ph];W[qi];B[oh]LB[ri:a][jh:b]C[The moves from B91 and B93 are a sequence of mistakes, from the result's viewpoint, Black should directly cut at 'a' with B91, after White attaches at 91, Black can get to play the vital hane move at 'b'.];W[rg];B[rm]LB[qg:a][qe:b][rf:c][rd:d][nh:e]C[B93: Black should connect at 'a' safely, although White has the tesuji of attachment at 'b', but Black can turn at 'c' then cross over at 'd', White has no chance to play at 'e' and White is very dangerous.];W[nh]
