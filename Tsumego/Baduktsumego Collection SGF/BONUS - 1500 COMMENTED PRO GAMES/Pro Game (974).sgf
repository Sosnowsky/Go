;B[qm];W[qc];B[qd];W[pc];B[od];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[qe];W[nc]C[The sequence from W16 to W28 is common, since Black on the right side is a little low in position, it seems White can fight.];B[jq];W[gq];B[mq]
;W[mo];B[pm]C[B33: Black is reluctant to play following opponent's thinking logic.];W[jo]C[But after White caps with W34, Black is always not comfortable.];B[ip];W[lr]LB[hn:a]C[W36 taking the base from the bottom is Gu Li's unique thinking, the common move is to make knight at 'a', which is also not bad.];B[lq];W[mr];B[io];W[kq];B[kp];W[kr]
;B[lo];W[mn];B[jn];W[co];B[ml]C[B45 and B47: Black gets to play on the outside, Black's shape is vivid.];W[dd]C[W48: White seeks to fight, which is correct choice.];B[fc];W[fd];B[gc];W[ee];B[ce];W[bd]
;B[be];W[ad];B[dg]LB[dh:a]C[B57: Black normally will play shoulder-hit at 'a'.];W[gd];B[eh]C[B59 is original move, if Black answers at top, White will cap at 59.];W[hc]C[W60: White is smooth.];B[hb];W[ib];B[hd];W[ic];B[gb]LB[bb:a]C[White seals Black in the corner. Later on White is still left with the endgame at 'a', White gains a lot.]
;W[fg];B[he];W[fh]C[W68 pressing consecutively is of good momentum.];B[ei];W[je];B[if];W[fi];B[ej];W[fj];B[ek];W[cl]C[Through W76, White gets to play on both sides, White's tempo is not bad.];B[gl]LB[dm:a]C[B77: For Black to play at 'a' first is relatively better.]
;W[gk];B[jf];W[hl];B[gm];W[fk];B[dl];W[fl];B[dm]C[Black's shape with B83 and B85 is weird, Black is not comfortable.];W[cm];B[dn];W[ck];B[cn];W[bn]
;B[fn];W[eo]C[W92: After White forms territory, ...];B[do];W[cp];B[ep];W[fo];B[go];W[fp];B[en];W[jj]C[..., Through W110, White is clearly leading in territory.];B[eq];W[fq]C[Now if White can handles the center well, White will be in a very favorable situation.]
;B[er];W[dq];B[lc]C[B105 is good move, Black has no assurance of success if simply attacking White in the center. Black aims to conduct two-pronged attack, it is a wise choice.];W[le];B[md];W[kf];B[ge];W[ef];B[kd];W[ld];B[kg];W[kc];B[jh]
;W[bb];B[cb];W[ac];B[fe];W[ed];B[fa];W[jm]LB[mc:a]C[W122 can be considered as losing move, the value of W 'a' is too big! After obtaining this point, Black really has certainty to kill White's big dragon?];B[jl]C[The original move of W122 is to take some advantage, but expectedly Black counterattacks strongly with B123. Afterwards, White is tied up firmly and can't take tenuki, eventually leading to a no-return road.];W[kn]C[W122 and W124 are clearly not good to White's making life in the center.];B[im];W[in]
;B[hm];W[ji]C[The shape of W128 is weird, Gu Li's tempo is bad.];B[hh];W[kl];B[hj];W[hk];B[il];W[ik];B[kk];W[jk];B[lk];W[li];B[lg]

;B[me];W[lj];B[mc]C[Black connects in sente with B151, however White's big dragon is still not alive cleanly, Black's territory is already not enough.];W[nb];B[lm];W[nk];B[pq];W[ir];B[ol];W[or];B[mk];W[mj];B[ok]
