Copyright by gogameworld.com and weiqi.tom.com.]RE[B+R];B[qd]C[The quality of last game between them is relatively high, this is rarely seen in finals.];W[pp]C[Hope today they give us another good game to enjoy!];B[dc];W[dp];B[cn]C[Recently Gu Li loves the opening of B1, B3 and B5.]
;W[fp]C[As to this, the jump of W6 is also what Chang Hao likes, aiming to prevent Black from playing mini-Chinese fuseki.];B[cf]C[The play of B7 is carefully prepared by Gu Li, good or bad? We still need to see the following game process.];W[od]C[Gu Li still dares play unfamiliar moves for both sides.];B[oc];W[nc];B[pc];W[nd];B[qf];W[jc];B[bp];W[cq];B[ck]
;W[jq];B[qn]LB[np:a][jp:b]C[Next if White jump to 'a' as in joseki, Black is left with the attachment at 'b', White's shape is not good.];W[ro]C[White wants to expand at maximum limit, allowing Black to play on the right side, which is not so big.];B[pk];W[og]LB[pm:a]C[The direction of W22 is questionable, White should continue to expand at 'a'.];B[or]C[The invasion of B23 is just right, White is difficult to answer.];W[pr]LB[oq:a]C[W24: White wants to make diagonal at 'a', however Black can directly enter the corner at 3-3 to turn body around. Therefore White can only elect to back up.]
;B[pq];W[qq];B[oq];W[qr]C[White's shape locally is very restricted.];B[lq];W[rn]C[Besides, after W22, the value of W30 becomes smaller.];B[no];W[kq];B[hc]C[Through B33, Black's opening is fast, Black already gains.];W[lp];B[lr];W[fc]
;B[de];W[fe];B[id];W[jd];B[je]C[B41 is strong move.];W[ke];B[ie]LB[kf:a]C[After Black connects with B43, B 'a' and Black's seal-off on the left become miai.];W[fg]C[It seems Gu Li's state is not bad today.];B[kf];W[le];B[ih]
;W[dj]C[W48 is a play in an unfavorable situation.];B[fi]C[The cut of B49 is inevitable. If White answers, Black already takes advantage.];W[dk];B[cl];W[hg];B[hh];W[dg];B[di];W[cg];B[eh]LB[ci:a]C[B55 and B57 are Gu Li's typical strong moves. In fact, even if Black crawls over, Black's situation is already very good. However that's his style, Gu Li rather defeats opponents by resignation than winning by points.

B57 is too direct, if Black descends at 'a', White is already very difficult.];W[cd]
;B[dd];W[bf];B[eg];W[cc];B[be];W[db];B[ce];W[bb]LB[ec:a][ef:b][fm:c]C[W66 is very vicious move. If White bumps at 'a', Black will retreat at 'b', then W66, next Black can reinforce at around 'c'. This way Black is still favorable.];B[fd]C[The tesuji of B67 is inevitable.]
;W[gd]LB[ec:a]C[W68 is overplay, White can only bump at 'a'.];B[eb];W[fb];B[da];W[ca];B[cb];W[ig];B[ba]C[After the ko fight, White gains little, Black didn't lose anything, Black is still clearly favorable.];W[jg];B[gf];W[hf]
;B[fa];W[em];B[el]LB[cj:a]C[B81 is good move, in sente to prevent White from pushing down at 'a'.];W[fl];B[gb];W[gi];B[gj]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.];W[hj];B[fk];W[gk];B[fj]
;W[dl];B[cj];W[hk];B[gg];W[jh];B[hi]C[Through B95, Black is leading a lot in territory.];W[mp]C[Following W96, White makes the last-ditch effort. However, it seems White is very difficult to achieve anything.];B[po];W[qp];B[op];W[on];B[nm]LB[he:a]TR[dj]C[B101 is the vital point for this shape. Now even if White encloses some points in the center, as long as Black can get to kill at 'a', Black would be still favorable. Looking back, it seems the play of W48 is too hasty (the marked stone).]
;W[om];B[ol];W[nl]C[W102 and W104: White still fights tenaciously.];B[nn];W[pl];B[ok];W[qm];B[ko];W[kp];B[lk]C[B111 again is the vital point for the shape.];W[mk];B[ll]
;W[mj];B[ml];W[nk];B[ji];W[ln];B[li];W[mi];B[oo];W[pm];B[lj]C[Through B123, Chang Hao concedes the game.

This game is Gu Li's complete victory.])
