;W[nq];B[qn];W[gq];B[ep];W[jp];B[cl];W[dn];B[fo];W[em];B[ci];W[cg];B[ei];W[eg]LB[cp:a][bq:b]C[B17 and W18: Both sides have overlooked the corner, it is inexplicable. I think, with B17 Black should take corner at 'a', with W18 White certainly should make knight at 'b'. This is related to the base for both sides and is a must.]
;B[cp];W[ek]TR[cl]C[Following W20, White captures the marked stone, but it is not big.];B[gi];W[dj];B[di];W[cj];B[ce]LB[bj:a][bo:b]C[Black's hane at 'a' and 'b' are all sente.];W[de];B[cd]LB[bj:a][bk:b][bh:c][ck:d]C[B27 is wrong order. Black should first play hane at 'a', White can only block at 'b', next B 'c', W 'd', then B27. This way there will be no variation in the game.]
;W[dd];B[bj];W[bg]C[Due to the exchange of B27 and W28, Black becomes heavy, White can elect to descend with W30.];B[bh];W[gk];B[cc]LB[jc:a]C[B33: Black lives the corner immediately and puts more emphasis on territory. If I were Black, I will elect to make extension first at around 'a'.];W[cb];B[bb];W[db];B[cf];W[df]
;B[bf];W[ag]C[Due to the addition of W38 and W40, it has some impact on Black in the left side.];B[bd];W[jc];B[fl];W[el];B[lc];W[je];B[ii];W[ik];B[qf];W[hh];B[hi]
;W[fk];B[gh];W[gg];B[oc]C[Black can make diagonal with B55, Black's speed is very fast.];W[qc];B[qd];W[ob]C[W56 and W58 are asking moves.];B[nb];W[kb];B[lb]LB[nc:a][pk:b]C[B61: Black overly concentrates on territory and is being taken advantage by W 'a' again. With B61 Black should take tenuki and make extension at 'b'.]
;W[nc];B[pb];W[ql]C[Through W64, the situation is close.];B[pr];W[or];B[oq];W[nr];B[qj];W[oo]C[The knight of W70 is good move.];B[po]C[Black is forced to play B71.];W[on]C[The extension of W72 is good shape.]
;B[pm];W[pj];B[qi];W[pk];B[om];W[fh];B[fi];W[jg]LB[lf:a][mf:b][mk:c][mm:d][mo:e]C[But following W80 White's play is really inexplicable. In the upper right corner where Black is very thick, White plays three consecutive moves of W80, W 'a' and W 'b', wrong direction. White again sinks into passivity. With W80 White should simply jump to 'c', followed by B 'd' and W 'e', which is huge. This way White's situation is not bad.]

;W[hf];B[mg];W[mf];B[ng];W[pi]C[W98: White has no choice but to reinforce himself.];B[mo];W[op]LB[pq:a][qr:b][iq:c]C[When Black jumps with B99, White can only exchange W100 and B 'a', it is very painful (originally if W 'b', there is still a loophole in the corner). Now Black can also destroy territory at 'c' since White becomes thin and Black thick. Black is clearly favorable for the game.];B[pq];W[mp]

With W134 White should first make diagonal at 'b', next B 'c', W 'd', B 'e' and W 'f', see whether Black dares to reinforce at 'g', this way White will get many ko threats. If Black tolerates at 'h', White already takes 2 point advantage. This way White still can play endgame.]
