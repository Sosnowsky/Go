;B[pj];W[rd];B[qe];W[gp]C[Through W24, I feel White is a little favorable, the reason is that White's lower-left corner is much thicker than Black's upper-left corner, and also the position of the splitting moves W12 and W14 is at a superb position.];B[dk];W[dh];B[fk];W[eg];B[fi];W[fh];B[ei];W[eh];B[bf]
;W[ih];B[ge]LB[gd:a][ik:b][jd:c][jc:d][hd:e]C[The knight's move of B35 is questionable, Black itself is left with the defect at 'a' and Black also doesn't put any pressure on White. With B35 for Black to stick his head out at 'b' is still better. Later on if Black wants to separate White, Black can directly strike at 'c' next W 'd' and B 'e'.];W[ee];B[ed];W[ik];B[id];W[el];B[cj]
;W[gi];B[gj];W[hi]C[W42 and W44 reinforcing are necessary.];B[cn];W[ic];B[en];W[re];B[rc];W[qf];B[qh];W[ph];B[pi]LB[of:a]C[The exchange of W52 and B53 is not really necessary, for White to jump simply at 'a' is common.]

;B[fm];W[gd]C[The diagonal cut of W68 is a strong move of Gu Li's style, Black is surprisingly not easy to connect.];B[ji];W[hj];B[gn]LB[mh:a][fl:b]C[B71: For Black to strengthen at 'a' is perhaps more urgent! When W 'b', then Black can atari with B71.];W[gl];B[fl];W[nh];B[mh]C[However, Black's sequence following B75 is too crude!];W[ni]
;B[mi];W[nj];B[mj];W[nk];B[mk];W[nl];B[hf]C[The diagonal of B83 is Lee Sedol's style, regardless whether it is reasonable, Black wants to separate White first.];W[kl];B[gg];W[gh];B[lm];W[jn];B[kk]
;W[kj];B[km];W[lk];B[ml];W[jm]C[However, in the fight from W84 to W94, Black doesn't gain any advantage.];B[ng]C[Not sure the sequence following B95 is miscalculation or Lee Sedol wants to grab territory first, but this kind of play is really far-fetched!];W[og];B[pg];W[mg];B[pf];W[kh];B[jh]
;W[ki];B[lg];W[lh];B[lf];W[nm]C[Through W106, Black's defeat has already been decided.];B[me];W[nf];B[jd];W[gb];B[np];W[mp];B[hp];W[ho]
