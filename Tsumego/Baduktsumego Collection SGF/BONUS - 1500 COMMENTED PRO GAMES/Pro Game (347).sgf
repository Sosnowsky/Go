Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[In the game 2 of the 29th Meijin best-of-7 title match, the challenger Honinbo Cho U took Black and defeated Meijin Yoda Norimoto by 3.5 points, the series is tied at one a piece.];W[dc];B[de];W[pp];B[cc]C[The sequence from B1 to B5 is Cho U's favorite opening while taking Black.]
;W[dp];B[oc];W[cb];B[cd];W[eb];B[ci];W[fd]C[Through W12, it returns back to one of the most common josekis.];B[nq];W[qn];B[pr];W[lq]LB[no:a]C[W16: White clearly knows White is not favorable in the ladder but White still elects to play one space low pincer, it is Yoda's unique thinking, obviously for White to extend at 'a' is also playable.]

;W[cq];B[hr];W[ph];B[qj]LB[cl:a][ck:b]C[B33: Black can also consider to make the two-space extension at 'a', in the game, later on White gets to make a two-space extension at 'b' in sente, Black is still a little unhappy.];W[oi];B[qm];W[rm];B[ql];W[nl]LB[ck:a]C[The set pattern from W34 to W38 takes the whole game into consideration, normally it seems a little damaging to territory, but Yoda is very good at this kind of situation. The other important reason is that White obtains sente and gets to extend at 'a', this can also help to keep balance in territory.]
;B[rh];W[qp];B[qg]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.];W[rq];B[rr];W[ck];B[dh];W[oe]C[The cap of W46 is a good point.];B[pd]LB[od:a]C[The double-up of B47 is a mistake, Black should bump at 'a', which is the right move.];W[nc]C[In the game, White attaches with W48, Black couldn't resist, White can obtain this effect with just one move, Black clearly fails.]
;B[nb];W[mc];B[mb];W[lc];B[he];W[ef];B[df];W[hg]TR[he]LB[if:a]C[The cap of W56 is a mistake, this is also the losing cause of this game. In fact, as to the marked black stone, White basically can't attack, however the cap most likely will drive Black towards White's potential territory, with W56 White should play shoulder-hit at 'a', this way White can enclose territory on the right side while Black tries to escape.];B[hc];W[id]LB[hd:a][gb:b][fc:c]C[W58 is originally a tempo of playing, if Black connects at 'a', White can reinforce by jumping at 'b', but White overlooks Black's good attachment at 'c', White doesn't have any good follow-up.]
;B[fc];W[hd]LB[ed:a][gf:b]C[W60: If White retreats at 'a', Black will make the diagonal at 'b', White is also very difficult.];B[gd];W[ge];B[gc];W[ed];B[fe];W[gf];B[ec];W[ee];B[dd]
;W[db];B[ic];W[jd];B[bb]C[In the game, from the push of W60 to the hane of B73, Black captures four white stones, Black obtains some profit and Black's situation is a little better.];W[pe];B[qe];W[hj];B[jo]C[The reduction point of B77 is just right.];W[iq];B[jq]C[After this move, this game was closed for the first day.];W[ir];B[jr]

;B[bq];W[bp];B[br]C[The variation up to B97 racks Black's brains in scheming.];W[ob];B[pb];W[jc];B[eg];W[ff];B[fb];W[od];B[oa];W[im]C[Through the extension of W106, the game is still slightly to Black's advantage.]
;B[lo];W[kp];B[jp];W[ko];B[kn];W[mo]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.];B[gm]LB[jn:a][kl:b][jl:c]C[B113 is somewhat conservative, Black can simply connect at 'a', if White still makes the knight's move at 'b', Black can crosscut at 'c'.];W[hl];B[jn]
;W[kl];B[en];W[dn];B[el];W[pk];B[dm];W[cm];B[pj];W[oj];B[ln];W[lp];B[jl]C[After the exchange of B125 and W126, then Black attaches with B127, it seems weird. If Black decides to crosscut at 127, the exchange should be reserved.];W[jm]

;B[fg];W[mm];B[mn];W[nm];B[ks];W[sm];B[sl];W[lm]LB[kr:a]C[Because Black has many local ko threats, with W188 White doesn't initiate the ko fight by playing at 'a'.];B[gg];W[hf];B[gj]C[But in the game the attachment of B191 is also not smaller then White's capturing two stones with W188, in the end Black is leading about 10 points on the board.]
