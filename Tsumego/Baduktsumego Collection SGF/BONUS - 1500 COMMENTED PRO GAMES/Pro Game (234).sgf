In the 14th Asian Cup Fast Game, Lee Sedol of Korea eliminated Ma Xiaochun 9p while coming from back in an unfavorable situation.];B[qd];W[dp];B[dc];W[pp];B[cn];W[fq]
;B[de]LB[cj:a]C[The corner-defending move of B7 is interesting, the common play is to make the extension at 'a'.];W[co];B[dn];W[dj];B[ch];W[dl];B[gn]C[Through the jump of B13, both sides are roughly acceptable.];W[gp];B[gl]C[W14 and B15 are equally good points.];W[fm]LB[gj:a][eh:b]C[W16: For White to jump at 'a' is common, but White doesn't want B 'b' to become an obviously good point.]
;B[em];W[fl];B[fn];W[gm];B[hm];W[el];B[ho];W[hl];B[im];W[hk];B[iq]C[As for Black, being able to make the knight's move with B27, Black can be satisfied.];W[kq]C[The tight checking move of W28 is unyielding, completely treating Black as lonely stones.]
;B[ei];W[jk];B[kn]LB[km:a][ko:b]C[B31: Black really puts much thought, if Black jumps to 'a', White will jump to 'b', Black's shape is defective.];W[lp];B[ej];W[gj];B[gr];W[eo];B[en];W[bo];B[nd]C[B39: Black gets to protect another corner, Black's opening is very fast.]
;W[jc];B[hc];W[nb];B[pc];W[qo]LB[lc:a]C[After two exchanges with W40 and W42, White tenukis to defend the corner with W44, it is strange, with W44 the normal play is to extend back at 'a'.];B[oq];W[pq];B[mo];W[np];B[mc]C[Since White plays somewhere else, B49 is inevitable.];W[jo]
;B[hp];W[jn]C[W50 and W52 seem no good, although separating Black's two stones and gaining some profit, but White in the lower left and center becomes weaker.];B[jm];W[km];B[kl];W[lm];B[jl];W[ml];B[eq]C[The attachment of B59 is a strong move.];W[er]LB[bn:a][fr:b][ep:c][dr:d]C[The hane of W60 is a mistake, making the block of B 'a' a sente move, White in the center suddenly has no way to retreat. White should block at 'a', if Black squeezes at 'c', White can jump over at 'd', this kind of tolerance is better.]
;B[dq];W[ep];B[fr];W[dr];B[cq];W[cr];B[bq];W[br];B[bn];W[gq];B[ij];W[ik];B[hq]
;W[aq];B[ll];W[mm];B[kj]C[The jump of B77 is a good point! Black takes the initiative on the board.];W[jj];B[ki];W[ih];B[jg];W[hf];B[gh]C[The knight's move B83 is a tempo of playing.];W[fh]LB[ig:a]C[W84: White is reluctant to attach directly at 'a', but the attachment of W84 is in fact unreasonable.]
;B[gg]LB[ig:a]C[Black elects to give way with B85, White gets time to take a break, now if Black pushes and cuts at 'a', White would be very difficult to handle.];W[ig];B[jf];W[fi];B[he];W[gf];B[fg];W[eh];B[if];W[cg];B[oj]C[Through 95, Black is clearly favorable in the game.]
;W[qi];B[pk];W[mj];B[ph]TR[nb]LB[mh:a][ql:b][mi:c]SQ[jc]C[The direction of B99 is wrong. Black should attach at 'c', only if White's two marked stones can't move out, Black will maintain the lead, in the game, due to addition of the jump at 'a', the square marked stone has some space for maneuver, what the most critical is that Black definitely thinks after the diagonal's extension at 'b' W96 is already dead, actually Lee Sedo didn't think that way.];W[mh];B[ql];W[rc];B[qb]
;W[lc]C[After the strike of W102, the attachment of W104 shows Lee Sedol's talent.];B[ld];W[kd];B[le]LB[mb:a]TR[qi]C[Being dazzled by the exchange of W102 and B103, Black plays two unvaluable moves of B105 and B107, actually now Black still should block at 'a', letting White to escape, then completely capture the marked white stone, Black is still no bad. In the game, after White makes life easily, the situation is already very close.];W[mb];B[ib];W[nc];B[md];W[ke];B[lf]

;B[bh];W[ci];B[bf];W[qh]TR[ph][ql]C[Afte White crawls out with W130, Black regrets strongly at the play of two marked stones, here Black simply couldn't capture White!];B[pg];W[rk];B[on]LB[rl:a][qk:b][rf:c]C[B133: If Black directly blocks at 'a', the squeeze of W 'b' is sente, then White can make the knight's move at 'c', White's big group would still live.];W[rf]
;B[no];W[lo];B[op];W[or];B[nq];W[nr];B[mq];W[lr];B[re];W[rl]C[In the game, it leads to an exchange, through W144, White is already a little favorable in the game.];B[qn];W[rn];B[rm]
;W[sm];B[qm];W[rp];B[hg]C[B151 is the biggest endgame on the board.];W[qf];B[sf];W[eg];B[df];W[ef];B[ee];W[fe];B[fd];W[sg]
;B[se];W[qe];B[rd];W[ng]LB[qg:a]C[W164 is unnecessary, to connect simply at 'a' would be better.];B[of]LB[ol:a]C[B165 is the last losing move, if Black makes the diagonal's move at 'a', it would be a close game and the outcome is still hard to say.];W[jr];B[bi]LB[qg:a]C[White gets to play two big endgames of W166 and 'a', Black has no enough points to give komi.];W[ck]

;B[pa];W[oc];B[mr];W[ms];B[od];W[pb];B[ns];W[ls];B[ob];W[in]C[After White pushes with W204 as a ko threat, Ma 9p failed to play the next move in time. If Black answers the ko threat, after White takes the ko and wouldn't answer any ko threat, Black is no good either.

Ma Xiachun lost the game by time, White wins by resignation.])
