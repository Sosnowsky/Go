Copyright by GoGameWorld.com and weiqi.tom.com.]RE[W+R];B[pd]C[Black is Lee Chang Ho 9P of Korea];W[dd]C[White is Hu Yao Yu 8P of China];B[qp];W[dp];B[fq]
;W[hq]C[The one-space pincer of W6 is Hu Yaoyu's favorite, I saw he played this move many times.];B[oq];W[cn];B[pj];W[kq]C[The extension direction of W10 is correct, the bottom is bigger than the top.];B[fc]C[The approaching direction of B11 is also correct.];W[cf];B[mc]LB[qc:a]C[B13: Black doesn't elect to make extension at the top, in order to guard against White's strike at 3-3 in the corner.];W[hc];B[db]C[The knight's of B15 is Lee Changho's typical "territory style".]
;W[fd];B[ec];W[gd];B[cc];W[bd]C[W20 is a thick move, but it appears slow.];B[cd];W[ce];B[dq];W[cq];B[cr];W[eq];B[dr];W[ep]
;B[cp];W[bq];B[bp];W[br];B[bs]C[Through B33, Black takes a big corner, Black is successful in the opening.];W[dj];B[jj]C[B35 is a shining good point on the board.];W[qd];B[qc];W[pc]C[W36 and W38 are Hu Yaoyu's brilliant feeling.];B[od]LB[oc:a]C[B39 is weak, if Black fights by playing at 'a', White is difficult.]
;W[rc];B[qb];W[re];B[rb];W[qg];B[qi];W[pe];B[sc]C[Through B47, White succeeds in the fight.];W[nf]LB[oe:a]C[W48: White can consider to press at 'a'.];B[rd]LB[qe:a]C[B49: Black takes happily, if White connects at 'a', Black will take tenuki.]
;W[lj];B[jl];W[ik];B[kj];W[lk];B[kl];W[hi]C[White's sequence from W50 to W56 seems incoherent, Hu Yaoyu looks a little hasty.];B[ed];W[ee];B[qe]C[After Black takes with B59, originally the single black stone in the center is alone, now the roles of defense and offense are switched. White forms a big moyo with W50, W52, W56 and W60, but Black still has a lot of tactics to reduce and White is not favorable in territory either.];W[hm];B[kh]
;W[nj];B[mm];W[nl];B[ml];W[pl];B[oi]C[B61, B63, B65 and B67 are Lee Changho's thick moves in a favorable situation.];W[lh];B[lg];W[mh];B[kg]C[Now Black is very thick, both sides' territory is about even, White is very difficult.];W[mg]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.];B[er]C[B37 breaks away from the main battle field and is unexpected. On the right side, White gets to act first, the situation becomes chaotic.]
;W[co];B[ar];W[ph];B[ok]C[Black makes diagonal-cut of B77, which is the only move. In the game, it inevitably leads to a fierce fight. After study, we thought White was dangerous, White can't make two eyes locally and has to kill Black in order to live.];W[nk];B[ol];W[om];B[nm];W[on];B[ql];W[qm];B[pk];W[rl]
;B[pm];W[pn];B[pf]C[B89 is very relentless. Black ignores his own eye shape in order to destroy White's eye shape.
];W[qf];B[oe];W[pg];B[rk];W[pl];B[qk]C[Through B95, it seems very chaotic.];W[rm];B[rh];W[rj]
;B[sg];W[rf];B[sk];W[pi]C[In the capturing race, Black is too fierce with B89. W102 is good move, if Black gets to play at 102, White's liberty is not enough.];B[rg];W[oj];B[si]C[Through B105, it forms a capturing race, Lee Changho seems to have miscalculated.];W[op];B[pp];W[np];B[nq];W[mp]
;B[mq];W[lp];B[hl];W[il];B[im]C[B113 and B115 prevent cut but are very damaging, Black is falling way behind in territory.];W[in];B[jm];W[hk];B[nn];W[no]C[White lives on both sides, Black in the center becomes thin. Black fails badly with all his territory being destroyed. Now White's situation is not bad. Who acts first on the right side makes a huge difference.];B[hg];W[bc]
;B[bb];W[ab];B[cj];W[ci];B[dk]C[White is very easy to live on the right side. Lee Changho sees his situation is hard to redeem, so with B125 and B127 he fights desperately.];W[gl]C[W128 is very steady move.];B[le];W[li]C[When W130, White is simply favorable.];B[bm]LB[ck:a]C[B131: Don't understand this move. Even if White plays atari at 'a', Black also loses.];W[bo]
;B[aq];W[ih];B[jh];W[ig];B[he];W[bj];B[ao];W[hb]TR[he][hg]C[After W140, Black's upper-left corner is ko-alive in gote. Black's two marked stones in the center are also going to be captured. Black already has no way to turn around the game.];B[ck]C[Black takes a little advantage with B139 and B141.];W[bk]C[W142: White can take tenuki and kill the corner.

;B[cm];W[ej]LB[jd:a]C[As to B143, W144 is clearly not good enough. If White kills Black's two stones by flying to 'a', White wins simply.
];B[ca]C[B145 is a good move. Since Black is difficult to find ko threats, Black has to form exchange. Black gains some points, but the game is still White's advantage.];W[ea];B[be];W[bf];B[aa];W[ba];B[bi];W[ch];B[aa]
;W[pr];B[qr];W[ba];B[of];W[og];B[aa];W[kk];B[jk];W[ba];B[fp];W[de];B[dc];W[cb]
;B[hd];W[gc];B[mf];W[mk];B[en]C[B171 is the biggest move on the board.];W[je];B[jd];W[kd];B[jf];W[jc]C[After White settles the shape simply, White is in a winning situation.];B[if];W[lc]
;B[lb];W[gf];B[hh];W[ii];B[hf];W[mb]C[W184 is severe miscalculation.];B[kb];W[kc];B[jb];W[me];B[lf];W[id];B[ib]LB[md:a]C[B191 is unbelievable mistake. If Black plays at 'a', the game becomes even closer.]
;W[md]C[After W192, Black's big dragon all die.

Hu Yaoyu 8p advances to the semi final.])
