Translation:GoGameWorld.];B[pd]C[In the second round of the 2nd CSK Cup Asian Team Contest, Japanese Team amazingly beat the "invincible" Korean Team by 4:1. There are several reasons, I think. First, it was commonly recognized that Korean Team is the strongest, but they may be not getting to the "invincible" point. Second, Korean Team is used to victories and didn't prepare themselves for this terrible defeat. Third, Lee Changho, Lee Sedol and Yoo Changhyeok all lost in the same round, which never happened in the past, this can be considered as an accident in Korean baduk history. Now I will introduce one 2nd-round game between Lee Changho and Hane Naoki.];W[dd]C[Hane Naoki is the Japanese Tengen holder, before long he lost to Lee Changho by 2:0 in the 4th Chunlan Cup final, so there are adequate reasons for Lee Changho to take the opponent lightly.];B[qp];W[dq];B[oq]

;B[ic]C[The opening from B1 to B19 is the same as the one that Lee Changho played recently in the Korean Kisung final to defeat Cho Hunhyun.];W[qf]C[In that game, White immediately entered the corner, as a result, Black won by resignation. In this game, the invasion of W20 is clearly a well-prepared move.];B[pf];W[qc];B[qe];W[nb]LB[ob:a][mb:b]C[The large knight's move of W24 is better than the small knight's at 'a', this move makes Black's tactic of checking at 'b' disappear.];B[pc];W[pb];B[nc];W[ob]
;B[mc];W[mb];B[lc]C[Although Black becomes thick with B29 and B31, but White has obtained sente and should have nothing to complain.];W[kp]LB[gd:a]C[W32 is an obvious big point, but White can also consider to play at 'a' to reduce Black's big moyo, however this may immediately lead to a fierce fight, which both sides don't want to get into.];B[go]C[B33 is a good point and absolutely can not be missed.];W[nq]C[W34: White probes Black and it's playable.];B[np];W[mp];B[op];W[mr]LB[oj:a][pk:b][qi:c]C[However, W38 is almost the losing move! White should jump to 'a', if White worries that Black may peep at 'b' later on, then White can bump at 'c' with sente, in any rate, 'a' is the vital point.]
;B[pl]C[B39 is brilliant! Black instantly forms a big moyo and White is falling behind.];W[ql];B[pj];W[pk];B[ok];W[qk];B[oj];W[qi];B[ph];W[ro]LB[rn:a][gd:b][hd:c]C[W48: In the game, White obstinately sticks to the wrong course, giving the chance for Black to strike first on the left side, early on Black has established his superiority. The reason why White ends in gote with W48 is that he worries about Black's knight at 'a', in fact White could get out of trouble by the counter-attachment at 48. It is imperative for White to play at either 'b' or 'c'.]
;B[ef];W[dh];B[ee];W[de];B[fh]LB[ei:a]C[However, just as the proverb says, good fortune always lies within bad. Being affected by the favorable consciousness, the "Stone Buddha" has begun to underestimate his opponent. First, B53 should be played as the knight's move at 'a' to seal off White, if so, White is hard to continue.];W[dj]C[W54: In the game, White takes the opportunity to attach out, the outcome of the game becomes unclear.];B[dk];W[ej];B[gj];W[ck];B[bk]LB[km:a][cl:b][ep:c][fk:d]C[The ensuing sequence from B59 and B63 shows that Black's confidence is shaking. If you want to enclose the center, you have to carry it out to the end. Black should flagrantly surround the territory at 'a', then W 'b', after the diagonal's sealing at 'c', then make the diagonal's extension at 'd', if White dares to come in, Black should have no hesitation to make the kill! Though this more fits Lee Sedol's style and is not to Lee Changho's liking, but in the situation where you don't have any other choice, you shouldn't worry about the style!]
;W[cl];B[bl];W[ci];B[bj];W[ij]C[W64: Because of Black's forbearance, White has more adequate and bold reasons to dive into Black's territory, Black now is faced with more difficult and severe choices. ];B[jm]C[B65: Black can no longer surround territory and can only make this symbolic attack, hoping to intimidate the opponent, but Hane is young and brave, plus the opponent is Lee Changho, who wants to miss this rare opportunity!];W[ih]C[W66: White dives into Black's moyo decisively, Black's territory has all been destroyed.];B[ji];W[ii];B[gh]C[B69: Because Black himself is not thick, Black has to reinforce.];W[il]
;B[hk];W[ik];B[in];W[kk]C[After White jumps out with W70 and W74, Black is already powerless to kill White's dragon.];B[nr];W[mq];B[li]LB[hl:a]C[B77: If Black blocks from outside, White can turn at 'a' to probe Black, Black is hard to succeed too; In the game after White runs out with the diagonal's extension, Black has already failed.];W[ll];B[lo]C[With the peep of B79, Black hopes to find some chances by starting a two-pronged attack, however Black himself is too thin.];W[mo];B[mn]
;W[hl];B[fk];W[kn]C[W84: After White jumps out, Black instead comes under attack.];B[km];W[lm];B[ln];W[ko];B[nn];W[gm]LB[ep:a]C[The diagonal's extension of W90 is a steady move, because the peep of B 'a' is too late, Black already can not longer kill White.];B[ip];W[ek]
;B[jq]C[With B91 and B93, Black turns to attack another White's group, but this White's big group is alive by itself.];W[no];B[oo];W[on];B[nm];W[om]LB[pm:a][or:b]C[But W96 and W98 are mistakes, White has neglected Black's push at 'a', White should simply atari at 'b'.];B[pm];W[or];B[pr];W[ns]
;B[pn];W[kr];B[ep];W[eq];B[kq];W[lp];B[jr];W[lr];B[ps];W[os];B[gr];W[el]LB[ho:a]C[Because Black has the defect of attaching at 'a', Black can no longer separate White, after White connects with W114, Black has suffered an overwhelming defeat! White wins for sure!]
;B[bo];W[bp];B[ig]C[B117: Black tries to surround territory at the maximum limit.];W[fb]LB[hg:a][jh:b][fp:c]C[W118: White wants first to take some advantages with sente and then decides whether to hane at 'a' or turn at 'b', but this is unnecessary, White only needs to simply push at 'c' to probe Black, Black will concede defeat immediately. In the game White doesn't get any advantage, instead White ends with some loss. Fortunately, White has taken such a big lead that it is still not enough for the game to be turned around.];B[gb];W[fd];B[eb];W[gc];B[fa]

;W[fe];B[gf];W[bn];B[cm];W[fc];B[rp]C[B155: If Black strengthens the left side, Black's territory on the whole board would be not enough.];W[rh];B[rg];W[fp]LB[fm:a][fn:b][gi:c]C[After White pushes with W158, Black concedes defeat. In fact, if Black attaches at 'a', White is not easy to kill Black, but White only needs to simply hane at 'b', then wedge at 'c', Black would still suffer a crushing defeat.]
