This is a huge challenge for him, since it seems that he never pass first rounds in all international games this year.];W[dp]
;B[de];W[od];B[oe];W[ne];B[pe]C[Yamashita's opening is unique.];W[ce];B[cf];W[cd];B[nd];W[md];B[nc];W[mc];B[nb]LB[ob:a]C[B17: The normal play is to make the small diagonal at 'a'.]
;W[mb];B[me];W[nf];B[le];W[jc];B[mg];W[pj];B[pl];W[of]C[After the turn of W26, a fierce fight starts.];B[pf];W[oh];B[qh];W[mh]
;B[lg];W[qg];B[pg];W[ph];B[qi];W[qj];B[rg];W[mj];B[lh];W[pc];B[nh]C[The wedge and atari of B41 is alert. Black guards against White's strategy of wrapping up and making three white stones light.];W[ni];B[mi]
;W[og];B[oc];W[na];B[pd];W[ob];B[od];W[nk];B[lj];W[lk];B[kj]LB[hc:a]C[With the extension of B53, Black forms a relatively thick influence in the center, later on forcing at 'a' will be very severe.];W[pn];B[pm]C[Black's hit of B55 is strong and unyielding! In front of Gu Li who is very famous in strength, Yamashita has no fear at all.]

;B[ni];W[kk]LB[op:a][oq:b]C[The attachment of W70 is a little far-fetched. White can consider to make the knight's move at 'a', if Black captures four white stones, White can obtain the corner territory; If Black crawls at 'b', White can capture four black stones, this way the situation would be relatively even.];B[jk]C[In the game Black is calm. With the hane of B71, Black first makes White's five stones heavy.];W[km];B[lm];W[kl];B[lo];W[no];B[on];W[pp]
;B[oq];W[nn];B[nm];W[mp];B[mn];W[qq];B[im];W[jn];B[lp]C[Black sacrifices the corner resolutely with the attachment of B87, concentrating his power to attack White on the outside.];W[mq];B[lq];W[mr];B[qp]
;W[op];B[qm];W[rn];B[qr];W[rq];B[rp]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.];W[rr];B[rs];W[jp];B[jq];W[iq];B[ip];W[io]
;B[hp];W[ho];B[gp];W[jr];B[kq];W[go];B[ir];W[sr]C[W112 is a local good move, otherwise the corner would  directly lead to a ko. However the aji in White's corner is very bad, Black can use for other purposes.];B[fp]C[After the extension of B113, White's lonely stones can't connect with the star stone and White sinks into a bitter battle.];W[en];B[eo];W[do]
;B[dn];W[fn];B[dm];W[fk];B[cq];W[bo];B[bn];W[dq];B[bp];W[co];B[el]C[The small diagonal of B127 is sente.];W[jj];B[fl]
;W[ik];B[ji];W[ij];B[ao]C[When Black crosses over with B133, White is already in a hopeless situation.];W[cr];B[br];W[er]C[W136 making a ko is the most tenacious play.]
(;B[cs]LB[rm:a][sm:b][so:c][pr:d][sn:e][sl:f][po:g][oo:h][om:i][qo:j][pk:k]C[Now the best sequence for Black is to push at 'a', next W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 'e', W 'f', B 'g', W 'h', B 'i' and W 'j', after this exchange, Black makes eyes at 'k' in sente, Black is already alive itself. Next Black can play as in the real game, the ko is worry-free for Black, this way White really doesn't know how to handle it (see var a).];W[ds];B[dr]
;W[hr];B[hq];W[cr];B[bs];W[gr];B[lr]LB[js:a]C[B145: Black should atari at 'a', this will make a big difference for the eye shape.];W[fq];B[dr];W[is];B[iq];W[cr];B[ep]

;B[am];W[fq];B[so];W[sn]C[The connection of W168 must have ruined Yamashita's plan.];B[fr];W[cm];B[cl];W[fq]LB[sq:a]C[It is obvious that a play at 'a' would form a multi-ko in the corner, but this is the trap that Gu Li set up.];B[po]LB[hl:a][jm:b][hc:c]C[B173: Black falls into the trap, Yamashita must have no time to calculate. Black's correct play is to make the diagonal at 'a', White eliminates the ko, Black's squeezing at 'b' is sente, separating White, in the big capturing race, it would be seki and Black takes sente. In the corner there is still a ko, next Black forces at 'c', White is no good.]
;W[oo];B[fr];W[bq];B[aq];W[fq];B[sq];W[fr]C[White eliminates the ko with W180, Gu Li already saw it clearly. After holding on for most part of the game, White obtains his first chance, White turns it into victory immediately.];B[ss];W[ls];B[om];W[qo];B[ks];W[ms]
;B[mo];W[pk]LB[ol:a][mm:b]C[After the atari of W188, if Black connects at 'a', White will throw in at 'b', Black is one liberty short. Gu Li  successfully kills a dragon luckily.];B[mm];W[ol];B[nr];W[np];B[ok];W[js]C[Gu Li advanced to the next round, which will take place on 8/23.])
