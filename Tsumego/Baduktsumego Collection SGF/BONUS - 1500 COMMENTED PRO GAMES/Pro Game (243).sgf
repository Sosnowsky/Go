;B[qo];W[kq];B[cq];W[dq];B[cp];W[do];B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[eq];B[cn]C[The opening up to B17 was used by Lee Changho many times before, this way White incurs some damage in territory, but White's speed is relatively fast, and White has the intention of leading this game into a simple situation and prolonged war.];W[qf]LB[nc:a]C[The inner-approach of W18 is seen very often recently, in the past to approach at 'a' is common.]
;B[nc];W[rd];B[qg]C[B21: Yu Bin has studied this variation.];W[pg];B[qh];W[ph];B[qi];W[pe]LB[rf:a][qc:b][pi:c]C[W26 is seen first time, the normal sequence is W 'a', B 'b', W26 and B 'c'.];B[qd]
;W[rc];B[oe];W[rf];B[pi]LB[of:a]C[The simple turn of B31 is the right move, to extend at 'a' is crude.];W[nh];B[oi];W[ne];B[of];W[nf];B[od];W[pf];B[kc]C[Through the extension of B39, both sides have settled, the situation is about even.]
;W[mj]C[W40 is the biggest point.];B[pm]LB[hc:a]C[B41 is a very steady move, but it seems weak, I think Black should make the two-space extension at 'a', keeping balance in the game. On the right side, Black has a solid worry-free corner and is not afraid of invasion temporally.];W[ic]C[The forcing move of W42 is very big.];B[qb]LB[lb:a]C[B43: Black has to answer one move, later on White is still left with the strike at 'a' as a follow-up tactic.];W[cf]C[Through W44, White's opening is successful.];B[fo]C[B45 is an asking move.];W[dn]LB[fr:a]C[W46 pressing out is a state of mind, to turn at 'a' calmly is also not bad.]
;B[cm];W[dm];B[cl];W[dl];B[jp]LB[ck:a]C[B51: Black wants to continue taking territory at 'a', watching how White to attack two stones, then handling lightly.];W[jq];B[hp]LB[ni:a]C[B51 and B53: Black aims at the push and cut at 'a'.];W[gp];B[ng]C[B55 is unexpected, it looks like Black has a pre-determined plan.]
;W[mg];B[og];W[oh];B[mh];W[lg]C[W60 is strong and unyielding, it is afraid that Black also doesn't have assurance of success in the fight around here.];B[lh];W[kh];B[li];W[ni]LB[kg:a];B[ip]C[B65: Black can only cut at 'a'.];W[iq]
;B[kg];W[kf];B[jg];W[le];B[ji];W[lc]LB[ok:a][pl:b][kk:c]C[W72: White can make the knight's move at 'a', next B 'b' and W 'c'.];B[lb];W[kb]C[W72 and W74: White wants to fix the shape in sente.];B[mc]
;W[kd]C[W76 is a good tesuji, Black is very painful, Black's situation is not good.];B[ld];W[jc];B[kk];W[lc];B[rb];W[ok];B[pl];W[ml];B[lk];W[mk];B[fp];W[go]
;B[fr]C[B87 and B89 are clearly desperate plays.];W[gn]C[W90 is steady.];B[fn];W[gm]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.];B[fm]C[With the push and cut of B93, Black is very difficult to take advantage.];W[fl];B[gl];W[fk];B[hl];W[gq];B[es]
;W[ck]C[The hane of W100 is huge.];B[mq]C[Black makes the two-space extension with B101, threatening two white's groups which are all not alive completely.];W[mr];B[nr];W[mp];B[nq]C[Now Black is falling behind a lot, Black has to wait for chances slowly.];W[oj];B[qk];W[ig]C[W108 is a good move, at the top White is not dangerous at this time.];B[jf];W[if]
;B[je];W[ie];B[cc];W[cd]C[W114 is a very surprising move, Lee Changho goes for the kill, as to Black, it is already a good chance.];B[dc];W[eb];B[ec];W[fc];B[ed]C[Black turns with B119, it seems White is difficult to kill.];W[bd];B[ch]C[Black invades with B121, making the game as chaotic as possible and trying to win the game in a chaotic situation.];W[co]
;B[bo];W[bl];B[bm];W[bj]C[The sequence from W122 to W126 is the simplest play, now let's see how Black to make life.];B[dj];W[am];B[bn];W[dk];B[fd];W[gc];B[eg];W[dh];B[dg]
;W[cg];B[bh]LB[eh:a]C[B137: Black wants to turn and capture at 'a', but Black may end in gote. In the game, B137 is a surprising move, Black perhaps wants to live by sacrificing.];W[di];B[bc];W[ff]LB[ee:a][fe:b][de:c][ef:d][ci:e]C[W140 is not good, White should hane at 'a', followed by B 'b', W 'c', B 'd' and W 'e'.];B[db];W[fb]
;B[de]C[After Black's hane of B143, because Black's descent on the first line is sente, Black's already hard to be killed.];W[bg];B[ac]C[After B145, Black is basically alive, Black's situation takes a better turn.];W[ik]C[W146: White has to open another battle field.];B[ih];W[jl];B[ke];W[md];B[lf]C[B149 and B151 are steady, White needs a great courage to connect two stones.];W[da];B[fg]
;W[ci];B[gf];W[lp]C[W156: White starts to play endgame.];B[hj];W[hk];B[lm];W[km];B[ll]C[Through B161, the situation has been turned around, Black is favorable. In this fight, White incurs a heavy loss, it looks like Lee Changho is not good at killing.];W[lj];B[jk];W[hh];B[hi]
;W[mf]C[White connects bravely with W166, now it is Lee Changho's turn to fight desperately.];B[nd];W[kf];B[ki];W[gh];B[fi];W[ij];B[ii];W[fh];B[ca];W[jd];B[lf];W[an]
;B[ao];W[kf];B[il];W[im];B[lf];W[al];B[bq];W[kf];B[gk];W[jh]C[Through W188, in terms of the ko result, White takes advantage, with B159, for Black to take two stones at 166 is simple and clear.];B[kn];W[ar];B[aq]
;W[ln];B[jn];W[jm];B[mm]C[Through B195, the game is over.];W[nm];B[nn];W[mn];B[nl];W[nk];B[hm]C[Yu Bin 9p advanced to the final, the final game 1 will take place on 3/28.])
