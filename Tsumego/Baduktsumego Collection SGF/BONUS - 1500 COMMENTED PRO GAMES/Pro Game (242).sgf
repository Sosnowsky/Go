;B[bd];W[cc];B[ci];W[po];B[qo];W[qn];B[qp];W[pn];B[nq];W[qj]C[Both sides elect to play the two most common josekis.];B[cn];W[fq];B[bp]
;W[cq];B[qf]C[B21: Black takes tenuki, it is interesting, clearly Black is not afraid of invasion.];W[dk]LB[dl:a]C[However as to White, since Black doesn't elect to make the knight's move at 'a', W22 making two-space pincer is inevitable.];B[do]LB[en:a][dm:b][dn:c][cm:d]C[The diagonal of B23 is a common tactic to fix shape, if Black jumps to 'a', then W 'b', B 'c' and W 'd', Black is heavy.];W[fo]LB[cp:a][bq:b][co:c][bo:d][dn:e]C[W24: White can also consider to wrap at 'a', followed by B 'b', W 'c', B 'd' and W 'e', to fight with Black, White is not worried.]
;B[cp];W[dq];B[dm]C[B25 and B27: Black's shape is very thick.];W[ej]LB[fm:a][el:b]C[W28: White can first jump to 'a', after exchanging with Black's diagonal at 'b', for White to play W28 is better.];B[fm];W[dh];B[ch];W[dg];B[cg];W[df]LB[kc:a]C[Locally White gains a little from W30 to W34, but Black is left with an excellent extension at 'a', the overall situation is not to White's advantage.]
;B[kc];W[mc];B[oc];W[ld];B[kd];W[ke];B[je];W[kf];B[jf];W[kg];B[hc]LB[id:a]C[B43 and B45 are not appropriate. With B43 Black should hang at 'a', how White to utilize his thickness is a difficult problem. In the real game, clearly the defect at 'a' is left, White can play.

;B[ic];W[qc];B[qd];W[ob]LB[jd:a][lc:b]C[W48 and W50 are good moves! If White simply cuts at 'a', Black can squeeze at 'b'.];B[pb];W[jd]
(;B[jc]LB[lc:a][he:b][md:c][le:d][nc:e]C[In the real game with B53 if Black still squeezes at 'a', then W 'b', B 'c', W 'd' and B53, now White can bump at 'e' (see var a).];W[ie]C[After this move, it is time for lunch break.];B[fd]LB[fb:a]C[B55: For Black to attach at 'a' is the original move.];W[gc]C[W56 is a strong move.];B[gd];W[if]LB[ed:a]C[But W58 is soft-hearted, to bump at 'a' is much better, Black has no special good move. In the game, it forms a big exchange, both sides are acceptable.]

;W[hp];B[gq];W[gp];B[jq];W[mq];B[me];W[le];B[ql]C[The invasion of B103 is a game-deciding move. Black perhaps feels although it is a close game, but Black's situation is a little inferior.];W[rn];B[pj]
(;W[pi]LB[pk:a][qk:b][oj:c][ok:d][ol:e][rh:f]C[W106: White seems to make compromise. In fact for White to play hane at 'a' is still better, next B 'b', W 106, B 'c', W 'd', B 'e' and W 'f', this variation is not to White's advantage.];B[qi];W[pk];B[oj]C[Through B109, Black still gains a big profit.];W[qk];B[ro]LB[ok:a][pl:b][ih:c][jg:d]C[But Black makes life right away with B111, Black loses the chance to turn the game around. Black should first exchange B 'a' and W 'b', then extend at 'c' to exchange W 'd', next Black can come back and play B111, this way Black's situation is a little better.]
;W[ih]C[The counter-sente endgame of W112 is very big.];B[hf];W[ig];B[no];W[hi]C[White is very happy to play the sequence following W116, here Lee Changho's play in the endgame is very beautiful, the situation is still close and slightly to White's favor.];B[gi];W[cd];B[gf];W[gh];B[fg];W[ok];B[nj]

With W156, White should hane at 'a', because there is no exchange of W156 and B157, Black's descent at 'b' is not working, White plays hane and connects in sente, then play W158, there will be no problem this way.];B[rh]LB[rk:a]C[B159: If Black plays hane at 'a', the game would be turned around.]
