;W[hc];B[oc];W[cf];B[qj];W[kc]C[The opening from B1 to W10 is popular recently.];B[fq]C[B11 is big point for sure.];W[cn];B[dr];W[dc]C[W14 is also very big, making B5 a completely damaging move.];B[cq];W[dj];B[fo]LB[nq:a][np:b]C[B15 and B17 are not coherent. Black takes territory with B15, with B17 Black should play at 'a' or 'b' to continue taking territory.]
;W[nq];B[or];W[nr];B[kq]C[As to the approach of W18, with B19 and B21, Black wants to take both sides.];W[pq];B[qq];W[oq]LB[qp:a]C[After W22, White is left with the cut at 'a'.];B[qr];W[kp]C[W26 first pressing Black is the playing tempo.];B[jp];W[jo]
;B[lq]LB[lp:a][ko:b][ip:c]C[B29 is the last move in the morning. They had played only 29 moves in two hours, enough to show that both sides see this game very important. However B29 is the first bad move.

With B29 Black should play atari at 'a', after W 'b', then Black connects with B29, this way White's atari at 'c' is not absolutely sente.];W[qp];B[qo];W[rp];B[pn];W[ro];B[rn];W[ip];B[jq]C[In the lower right corner, White is left with the tactic of making life.]
;W[fn]C[W38 is light and nimble.];B[io]LB[oo:a][no:b]C[B39 is a big questionable move, since here White is very light. Black should make knight at 'b' to fix shape before White peeps at 'a'.];W[go];B[jn];W[qm];B[qn];W[oo];B[po]LB[rq:a]C[In the process, with B45 at any rate Black should take tenuki and play at 'a', not allowing White to live completely.];W[pr]
;B[rq];W[fp];B[gp];W[eo]C[White takes one stone in sente.];B[hp];W[eq];B[er];W[hg]C[Then White gets to enclose territory with W54, White establishes superiority very early on.];B[lr]C[B55 is a hasty move.];W[on];B[om];W[nm]
;B[nl]LB[ol:a]C[B59: Black should retreat at 'a'.];W[mm];B[ml];W[mo]C[After White lives completely, ...];B[ld];W[kd];B[le];W[qe]C[..., White only needs to attach in with W66 to destroy Black's moyo.];B[rd]C[As to White, it is too easy.];W[pm]
;B[ol];W[rm];B[sp];W[qi];B[rj];W[mh];B[kh];W[ne]C[Following W76, White handles lightly.];B[ke];W[nc];B[od];W[nd];B[lc]

;B[jd];W[pa];B[qb];W[he];B[ib];W[hb];B[pg]C[B101: Black has to try to kill, since Black is already way behind in territory.];W[mf]C[W102: White aims at Black's weak points.];B[ng];W[mg];B[ie];W[if]C[Following W106, White is not soft-hearted.]
;B[hd]C[Black's damage becomes bigger.];W[ic];B[gd]C[But as to Black who can only kill to win, there is no other choice.];W[jc];B[lb];W[id];B[je];W[fb];B[jg];W[li];B[kj]LB[jj:a]C[B117: If Black makes knight at 'a', White will make diagonal at 117, Black is also not good.]
;W[oi];B[ge];W[hf];B[ph];W[lk];B[ll];W[ki]C[White counterattacks with W122 and W124.];B[ji];W[jj];B[jk];W[ij];B[ii]C[Since the liberty of Black's big dragon is very tight, it can't form a capturing race.]

;B[rh];W[og];B[oh];W[nh];B[of];W[lj];B[jm];W[nj]C[White connects in sente with W148 and makes life with W150, Black can only concede the game.];B[eb]LB[la:a][ri:b][pj:c]C[If Black continues to destroy eye at 'a', after W 'b', White can turn at 'c', making another eye.]
