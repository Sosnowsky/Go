;W[qj];B[cf];W[di];B[fc];W[df];B[cc]LB[dg:a]C[B11 emphasizes territory, the hane at 'a' is common.];W[dc];B[cd]LB[dg:a]C[If B13 hanes at 'a', it will lead to a complex variation, which Black does not like.];W[de];B[ce]
;W[cg];B[bg];W[bh];B[ch];W[dg];B[bi];W[ci];B[ah]C[Through 23, it becomes a typical representative of white's thickness versus black's real territory.];W[jc];B[qf];W[qm];B[ie]C[B27 reduces immediately to take the initiative.]
;W[nc]LB[je:a][jf:b][if:c]C[W28 would like to attach at 'a' right away, if Black hanes at 'b', White can fight by cutting at 'c'.];B[ke]C[B29 is a good move, White is not comfortable.];W[pc]C[The sequence following W30 appears rather unconvincing.];B[qc];W[qb];B[qd];W[ob];B[kc];W[gd]C[W36 is worth more study.]
