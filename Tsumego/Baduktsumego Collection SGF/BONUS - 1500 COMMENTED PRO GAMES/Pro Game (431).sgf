Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[In the game 3, Gu Li 7p killed one dragon and defeated Park YuongHoon 9p by resignation, winning the series by 2:1 and keeping his invincible record in this event.];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[fc]
;W[cf];B[kc];W[po];B[pl];W[qj]C[W10 is positive.];B[qm];W[qg]C[W12 is the right move, settling W10 is more urgent than settling W8.];B[od];W[lp]LB[mp:a][pp:b][iq:c]C[W14 appears a little unreasonable, if White plays at 'a', next B 'b' and W 'c', this is more simple and clear.]
;B[nq];W[np];B[mq]LB[mp:a]C[B17: For Black to wedge at 'a' is just the strongest counterattack.];W[qq]LB[qo:a][mp:b][lq:c]C[W18: White is reluctant to allow Black to cross over at 'a', W18 is more attack-oriented! But B9 and B11 are not easy to be attacked, therefore with W18 for White to connect at 'b' is better, next B 'a' and W 'c'.];B[qr];W[pp];B[oq];W[rp]
;B[rq];W[qp];B[rr];W[nn];B[ok];W[oh]C[The knight's move of W28 is the shape.];B[mk];W[mp];B[kq];W[mh];B[db]LB[kk:a]C[B33 fully shows Park YuongHoon's ardently love to territory. Black should jump to 'a' and make himself smooth, and also aim to attack White, isn't this more dignified?]
;W[cc];B[hd];W[mc]C[W34 and W36 are not consistent, due to the addition of B35, then White invades with W36, White inevitably will get into a bitter battle, with W34 for White to invade directly at 36 is relatively better.];B[me];W[kk]C[W38: White handles W36 by tangling with Black's big dragon, this is much more clever than directly escaping W36.];B[lj];W[ld];B[kf];W[kh];B[kj];W[ob];B[pc]
;W[ke];B[lf];W[jc]C[The attachment of W48 is a good move, fixing the shape by sacrifice!];B[jd];W[jb]LB[kd:a][ic:b][kb:c][je:d][id:e][he:f]C[But not clear with W50 why White doesn't cut at 'a', if B 'b', then W50, B 'c', W 'd', B 'e' and W 'f', White is very easy to handle. During the process, if Black doesn't capture two stones at 'c' and cap at 'd' instead, then by playing at 'c' White can live much bigger than the real game.];B[kd];W[kb]
;B[ri]LB[je:a]C[B53: Black snatches away White's base to gain profit by attacking. Because B 'a' is sente at the top, White is not very easy to deal with his big dragon, afterwards Black already makes life by attacking, Black's profit is not small.];W[qi];B[rh];W[rg];B[rj];W[qk];B[qh];W[ph];B[rk];W[oj];B[ql];W[of]
;B[je];W[nc];B[re]C[B67: Black continues to tangle, White is very uncomfortable.];W[mf];B[nf]C[B69 is a strong move! Because White is not alive at the bottom, White is not favorable in ko threats, White can't win the ko.];W[ng];B[mg];W[ne];B[nd];W[mf];B[op];W[oo]
;B[nf];W[kp]C[W78: White has no choice but to give up the ko, Black again scores.];B[oe];W[nj];B[nk];W[mj];B[jq]LB[pf:a]C[B83 is of favorable consciousness, otherwise why not continue to chase and attack at 'a'?];W[lk];B[jj];W[pf];B[km]C[However, even if White gets to strengthen with W86, because the cut of B87 is severe, White is still in a bitter battle.]
;W[jk];B[ik];W[jl];B[mm];W[il];B[jo]C[After Black seals off with B93, White lives inside very painfully, Black is favorable for the game.];W[qn];B[mn];W[rm];B[rl];W[ro];B[sm];W[om]C[After this move, it is time for lunch break.]
;B[in];W[ho]C[W102: White wants to take advantage before making life.];B[hl]C[But B103 is severe!];W[hm];B[hk];W[im]C[W104 and W106 are heavy, White's situation has deteriorated further.];B[jp];W[rn];B[gm]C[Now it is the best moment for Park YuongHoon, if we can say he is now in heaven, then after one move, he immediately sinks into hell.];W[hn];B[dg]LB[ll:a]C[The shoulder-hit of B111 is a beautiful move originally, however Black forgets to make an exchange. With B111, originally for Black to hang at 'a' is absolutely sente, this way Black's situation is indeed not bad.]
;W[ln]C[W112 is sharp! Black's big dragon is immediately ko-killed by White, Black instantly collapses! When Park YuongHoon sees W112, I think the only thing he can do is to regret! ];B[lo];W[ko];B[kn];W[ml];B[nl];W[ll];B[nm];W[lm];B[mo];W[no];B[pm];W[pk]
