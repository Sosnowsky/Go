(;W[md]LB[od:a][oe:b][ne:c][me:d][nd:e][nc:f][mc:g]C[The attachment of W14 is a good move. The usual play for White is to block at 'a', then Black can cut strongly at 'b', followed by W14, B 'c', W 'd', B 'e', W 'f' and B 'g', due to shortage of liberties, White would be hard to move (see var a).]
(;B[le]LB[od:a][kd:b][mc:c][me:d][ne:e][mf:f][nd:g]C[B15: Since White doesn't block at 'a', Black should push out at 'a'. Therefore, White would hane at 15, then B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f' and W 'g' (see var a). In the game, because White's shape is resilient, Black is not easy to attack.];W[od];B[qe];W[pf];B[qf];W[pg];B[qg]

(;B[nf];W[ne];B[me]LB[mf:a][oe:b][ph:c][pk:d][ng:e][mc:f]C[B27 and B29 are vulgar plays! This ends in the exactly same shape as if that Black first make the crude turn at 29, then W28 and B27. These two moves help White make life, after White cuts at 'a', Black's liberty is also very tight. Black should first strike at 28! Then W 'b', B 27, W 'c' and Black then can start a two-pronged attack by attaching out at 'd' (see var a). Moreover, when B28, if White counter-attacks at 27, Black's tiger at 'a' would be a good move, then W 'e' and B 'f', White has no answer (see var b). Perhaps Yoo Changhyeok wants badly to play the tiger move at 'c', in fact even though White extends at 'c', Black can attach out at 'd' and still would maintain his attacking posture.];W[nc];B[ph];W[mf];B[og]
;W[ng];B[of];W[oe];B[oh];W[on];B[mp]LB[je:a]C[B39 is too conservative. Black certainly should reinforce at 'a'! This move is huge itself and will help the moyo in the center, it also threatens White's large-knight corner.];W[kd];B[lf];W[jd]C[W42: After White has captured the two black stones, Black already takes the lead in the game.];B[pm];W[pn]

(;B[mn]LB[ro:a][fq:b][cn:c][rl:d][qm:e][rk:f][op:g][oq:h][ko:i]C[With the exchange of B45 and W 'a', Black has suffered some losses in territory. Black should approach at 'b', then W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f', W 'g', B 'h', W45 and B 'i', maintaining a slow attack on White (see var a).];W[ro];B[fq];W[cn];B[fo]
;W[dr]C[W50 is a "vicious" move! Facing with Black's big moyo, Yoda still wants to obtain territory first.];B[er];W[kq];B[mq];W[hq]
(;B[ho]LB[dq:a][cq:b][ep:c][do:d][cr:e]C[B55 is not the right shape, Black should wedge at 'a', then W 'b', B 'c', W 'd' and B 'e', initiating a ko (see var a). Because Black has ko threats on the right side, Black should have no problem to win the ko fight.];W[gp];B[fp];W[gr]C[W56 and 58 are good move! White still threatens Black while making eyes.];B[hp];W[gq];B[go];W[cq]LB[ir:a][cr:b][ck:c][fr:d]C[W62 is again very vicious! Actually White can make eye at 'a', White would enter the corner at 'b', White then makes the two-space extension at 'c', White should be very satisfied. However Yoda still wants to get the corner at 62, forcing Yoo Changhyeok to play at 'd', then makes life at 'a', it is really irritating!]
