;B[pj];W[dj];B[fq];W[nc];B[pf];W[dn];B[jp];W[jd]C[In the opening up to W14, it is a mirror-go situation.];B[jj]C[After Black takes the tengen with B15, the imitation ends. The tengen point is the vital point of both sides' moyo, now let's see how White to reduce.];W[mo]C[There are many variations following W16, the play in the game is one of them.];B[mq];W[ql]
;B[qj];W[ok]LB[oo:a][qo:b]C[But White sticks head out with W20, next White can attach at 'a' or at 'b', this way White is not difficult to handle.];B[om]C[B21 is the urgent point.];W[ol];B[pm];W[qk];B[ml]C[B25 is good tempo, White appears a little heavy.];W[oj];B[ph]LB[mj:a][pg:b][qh:c]C[B27: Black wants to attack at 'a', but worries White may attach at 'b' or invade at 'c', however, in the real game Black also takes initiative.]
;W[oh];B[og];W[nh];B[le]C[Following B31, Black chases and attacks on the crest of a victory, showing the vigor of young players.];W[lk]C[W32: White certainly should pound on Black.];B[mk];W[li];B[kk];W[mf];B[nd];W[ll];B[lj]
;W[mj];B[kj];W[mm];B[lm];W[kl];B[nm];W[jl];B[mn]C[Next, up to B47, Black makes ponnuki with B47 and can adequately fight.];W[hl];B[kg];W[kf];B[lf];W[lg]
;B[lh]C[For B49 or B53, there are many more other ways to play, but they are all relatively complicated and difficult to select.];W[mg];B[jf];W[ke];B[ld];W[kh];B[jg];W[jh];B[ih];W[ii];B[hh];W[hi];B[gi]
;W[ik];B[gj];W[ij]TR[jj][kj][lj][kk]C[However, through W68, Black's four key stones are being captured, Black clearly fails in the attack and the situation is not clear.];B[id];W[kd]C[As to B69, W70 is a strong move.];B[fd]C[B71: Black takes chance to turn the body around.];W[ie]LB[ee:a][lc:b]TR[jd][kd][ke][kf]C[But W72 is questionable, White should extend at 'a', White's moyo on the left side is magnificent and hopefully can form territory, however White still doesn't have any good way to attack White's four stones. With W72 White also should play hane at 'b', Black is painful.]
;B[ee];W[dd];B[hd];W[ig]LB[lc:a]C[After White cuts with W76, White can no longer play hane at 'a'.];B[ff];W[hg];B[ec];W[dc];B[eb];W[db];B[gh];W[dg]
;B[oc]C[Through B85, the local variation comes to an end and the situation is still not clear.];W[dr]LB[hq:a]C[W86: White also can consider to invade at 'a' to attack in order to defend.];B[cl]C[The invasion of B87 is alert!];W[cj];B[cn]C[The attachment of B89 is a good move!];W[dm];B[cq];W[cp]LB[dq:a]C[As to the peep of B91, with W92 White should connect at 'a', as for the result in the real game, White incurs loss.]
;B[dq];W[eq];B[er];W[ep];B[cr];W[fr];B[ds];W[gq];B[bp];W[bo];B[eh];W[dh];B[de]
;W[ce];B[nj];W[mi];B[oi];W[ni];B[pi];W[nk];B[aq];W[bn];B[ek];W[ej];B[fk];W[dl]
;B[he]LB[fc:a]C[B119 is to guard against White's cut at 'a' and also Black has favorable consciousness. In fact now the situation is still unclear.];W[jr];B[iq];W[ir];B[kq];W[ro];B[rn]LB[qg:a]C[As to the attachment of B125, White should first peep at 'a' to probe Black.];W[qn];B[qm];W[rm]

;W[ne];B[oe];W[ja]LB[hb:a]C[White's last losing move is W170, White should bump over at 'a'.];B[fa];W[fb];B[fc];W[ga];B[hb];W[qd]C[Finally, the crawl of W176 is to take endgame advantage.];B[nb]C[But following B177, Black's calculation is accurate and kills White's big group, so far Black wins the game for sure.];W[ri]
;B[rj];W[or];B[oq];W[rg];B[rf];W[re];B[qe];W[sf];B[qf];W[qb];B[rc]C[Hope starting from this point, Li Zhe 4p wins more champions.])
