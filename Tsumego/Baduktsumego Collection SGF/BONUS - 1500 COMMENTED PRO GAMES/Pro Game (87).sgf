Translation:GoGameWorld.];B[pd]C[After exactly one week, here comes the second game of the 37th Korean Paewang final, because Yoo Changhyeok 9p won the first game, so in this game he elects to play solidly, it is a psychological factor in serial games.];W[dc];B[pp];W[cp];B[eq]
;W[do];B[ci];W[ck];B[ce];W[ed]C[The two small diagonal's extensions of W6 and W10 would be quite normal plays from Lee Changho rather than Yoo Changhyeok.];B[ic]LB[cg:a][ee:b]C[B11 is a positive move, if White invades at 'a', Black can fight by attaching at 'b', recently Lee Changho has changed his style gradually.];W[kc]C[W12: White is one step slow but still wants to counter-pincer, reflecting the style of "the strongest attacker".];B[bc]LB[ie:a][ef:b]TR[ic]C[B13: It seems that Black feels wronged and acts rashly, the normal play is to jump at 'a' or make the knight's move at 'b', looking after the marked black stone.]
;W[je];B[he];W[df];B[cf]LB[de:a][ge:b]C[B17: Black can't consider to push and cut at 'a', after being attached by Black at 'b', White would suddenly have no answer.];W[dg];B[cg];W[dh];B[di];W[ei];B[ej];W[fi]
;B[fc];W[de];B[ch];W[gd]C[W26 and W28 are severe!];B[ie]C[Black has to play a crude move at 29 in order to get out, it can't be good for Black.];W[jf];B[hg];W[nc]LB[ig:a][hh:b][gf:c][gc:d]C[W32 is slow! Now White certainly should diagonal-bump at 'a' to continue attacking. If Black extends at 'b', then White can happily peep at 'c' in sente, then separate one stone at 'd', Black would have to escape on his own, White should have nothing to complain.]
;B[gc]C[B33: Black connects back one stone and secures eye space.];W[qf];B[fg]C[After the peep of B35, White instead comes under attack.];W[gh];B[fd]TR[gd]C[B37: Black can push and capture the marked stone with sente to obtain safety, and White's stones come under attack, White has suffered a big defeat.];W[gg];B[ff];W[fh];B[nd];W[od];B[oe]
;W[oc];B[pe]
(;W[qi]LB[pc:a][rd:b][ph:c][md:d][lb:e][qc:f][pb:g]C[The two-space extension of W46 is slow, White should crawl at 'a', then B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f' and W 'g', Black is still not alive (see var a).];B[md];W[mc];B[ld];W[jc];B[pc]LB[nb:a]C[In the game, after Black blocks at 51 with sente, although White can turn at 'a' tenaciously, but Black still can make life with one move, White hasn't achieved much by attacking, Black is favorable for the game.]
;W[ig];B[eb];W[nb];B[qk]LB[dk:a][hh:b][og:c][ng:d]C[B55: Black excessively seeks efficiency, in fact now Black only needs to simply hang at 'a', later on White has to guard against the push at 'b' and it would be hard to White to attack Black fiercely in the upper right. If White knight-attacks at 'c', Black can live by attaching at 'd', White would be harder to play for the whole game.];W[og];B[ph];W[pg];B[rc];W[nf]
;B[ne];W[gf];B[ge];W[dj]C[W64: After White separates one black stone, White has formed an overwhelming outside thickness, the board becomes bigger.];B[hq]LB[bl:a][fp:b]C[B65: Black has given too high estimate on the tactic of destroying territory at 'a', I think Black should make the diagonal's extension at 'b'.];W[fp];B[fq];W[ho]C[W66 and W68: In order to win the game, White battles Black by expanding his center moyo.];B[qh]LB[qq:a][jp:b]C[B69: Because there is an excellent point for White to enter the corner at 'a', Black can't make the knight's move at 'b', but being pressed by White with sente, Black is very painful.]
;W[ni];B[pi]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.];W[iq];B[ir];W[hp];B[gq];W[jq];B[jr];W[ml];B[lm]C[B79: Black invades fiercely.];W[ll];B[km]
;W[kq];B[mm];W[nl];B[on];W[il];B[jl];W[jk];B[im];W[hm];B[nj]LB[bl:a]C[B91 is not good, Black should simply play at 'a'.];W[mj];B[mi]
;W[mh];B[li];W[nh];B[ik];W[hl];B[kk];W[jj];B[kl];W[oj];B[in];W[hn];B[bl]LB[pl:a][bj:b][pr:c][dr:d]C[B105: If Black makes the diagonal's extension at 'a', then W 'b', B 'c' and W 'd', Black has no assurance of success.]
;W[pm]TR[oj]C[Due to the addition of the marked white stone, the counter-attacking after W106 is severe, however now Black has more territory and can win the game by simply settling his two groups.];B[rm];W[pn];B[oo];W[rn];B[qg];W[pf];B[qm];W[qn];B[pl];W[om];B[lj]
;W[nk];B[ji]LB[mq:a]C[B119 is unnecessary, settling himself by playing at 'a' is important.];W[rf];B[rd];W[qq];B[pq];W[qp];B[sn]LB[ri:a][rl:b]C[But Black couldn't read clearly under the time pressure and elects to hane at 125, the game becomes complicated. In fact, there would have no problem if Black tenukis! If White stands at 'a', Black can block. If White clamps at 'b', Black can hane in the first line to get out of trouble.];W[pb]
;B[qb];W[qe];B[qd];W[kr];B[cr];W[mo];B[nn];W[ij];B[ko]C[After B135, Black still can make life.];W[nq];B[lp];W[jn]C[W138 is a strong move.]

(;B[mq]LB[mr:a][nr:b][jo:c][oq:d][lq:e][qr:f][ps:g]C[B139 is the losing move! Black should make the knight's move at 'a', then W139, B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', White can only connect at 'e', after Black hanes at 'f', then hangs at 'g', Black is alive, thus the game would be still a little favorable for Black.];W[nr];B[np];W[mp];B[lq];W[lo]C[After the cut of W142, W144 is a good play! Black already can't live unconditionally.]
;B[kp];W[jo];B[mr];W[ms];B[ls];W[ns];B[kn]LB[or:a][qr:b][bk:c]C[B151: If Black diagonal-bumps at 'a', then hangs at 'b', although Black can live, but White can capture six stones at 151 in sente, then block down at 'c', Black would still suffer a crushing defeat.];W[lr];B[lh];W[lf]

;W[kf];B[hh];W[kj];B[lk];W[ki];B[jg];W[if]LB[po:a]C[Finally, Black could play at 'a', although it is a ko-kill, but this is picnic ko for White, also White has an infinite ko threats on the right side, so after White cuts at 174, Black can only concede defeat.
Yoo Changhyeok 9p leads 2:0, the game 3 will take place on 6/13.])
