(;SZ[19]EV[1st Ing Cup final game 5]DT[1989-09-05]PC[Singapore]PB[Cho Hunhyun]BR[9p]PW[Nie Weiping]WR[9p]RE[B+R]C[The most regrettable game: In the final of 1st Ing Cup, after losing a good game regrettably in the game 4, Nie Weiping's play in the game 5 can't compare with Cho Hunhyun's. Before this game, although Nie Weiping also lost in the 4th China-Japan SuperGo match, but overall he always seemed to have stayed in an up trend. However after he lost this match, even if he also won some games occasionally but couldn't turn the tide in his favor any more. On the other hand, since he won the champion, Cho Hunhyun not only started a new chapter in Korean Go history, he also becomes vigorous for a long time and never seems to decline. One game had changed the destiny of two high hands, luck really makes fun of human! Just because of this, Nie Weiping said more than once that this game made him deeply sorrowful for a life time!];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dc];B[de];W[po];B[oo]
;W[qq];B[pp];W[qp];B[on];W[qn];B[qm]C[The attachment of B13 and the hane of W14 are same as we played in the final game 2.];W[rm];B[pn];W[qo];B[ql];W[rl];B[qk];W[fd]C[W20 is the only move to keep balance for the whole game.]
;B[cc];W[cb];B[cd];W[eb];B[ch];W[cn];B[nd];W[jq];B[hc]C[Black forces tightly with B29, but it seems a little unreasonable.];W[kd]C[White elects to invade with W30, I have spent 20 minutes on this move.];B[ge];W[kf]C[Through W32, inside Black's moyo White basically becomes immune for attack with a simple jump, White's opening is not bad.]
;B[ed];W[fc];B[fe];W[bc];B[bd];W[bb];B[rk];W[qd]C[W40 is unexpected.];B[qc];W[rc];B[qe];W[rd];B[pc]
;W[re];B[qf]C[B47 is questionable.];W[rf];B[qg];W[qb];B[pb];W[rb]C[Through W52, Black's territory is being ruined, White's corner territory is not small, especially making B39 a small move. White is very successful.];B[kh]C[The cap of B53 is inevitable to attack White's two stones.];W[jc]C[However the diagonal of W54 is very calm, Black couldn't continue attacking Black temporarily.];B[io]C[With the sequence following B55, Black starts to cultivate the center.];W[lp]
;B[pr];W[np];B[op]C[When White peeps with W58, after Black spends a lot of time thinking, eventually Black still connects with B59, but being blocked by W60, Black has incurred a 3-4 point damage.];W[qr];B[kn];W[hp];B[gn];W[mf]LB[fp:a]C[White takes time to strengthen weak stones at the top with W64, it shows White is very optimistic about his situation, otherwise White certainly should defend at 'a'. However, this move causes White to lose all his earlier advantage, it is a huge slow move.];B[le];W[lf];B[mh]C[Black first peeps with B65 then seals off with B67, Black is alert. This makes White not able to play somewhere else.]

;W[gk];B[ej];W[em];B[fl];W[ek];B[fk]LB[fi:a][hd:b]C[B125: Black should take at 'a', allowing White to connect at 125. Black can take tenuki to connect back one stone at 'b', this way Black would be favorable for the whole game.];W[fj];B[gj];W[fm];B[gl];W[hd]C[However White separates one stone with W130, White's profit is huge. Now the game again is to White's advantage.]
;B[ao];W[am];B[do];W[co];B[bm];W[bn];B[an];W[rg];B[bp]C[White crawls with W138, in order to gain some time, Black elects to peep with B139.];W[bq]LB[rh:a][ap:b]C[The block of W140 was regarded as the most terrifying impulsive move in modern Go history! In fact, B139 is not a sente move at all. Normally with B139 Black should hane at 'a', White plays atari at 'b'. However in order not to give the opponent any thinking time, I unexpectedly blocks with W140. With the exchange of B139 and W140, Black takes a 3-point advantage. White sinks into a losing situation instantly.]
;B[rh];W[mn];B[mm];W[nr];B[sl];W[me]C[W146 is perhaps the last losing move.

Later on, although there were still complicated ko fights, but White already can't redeem his defeat. This game makes me regret for my whole life.];B[rn];W[ro];B[sm];W[of];B[oe];W[nf];B[md]
