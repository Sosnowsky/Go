;B[cf];W[ch];B[dn];W[cl];B[dp];W[ep];B[cq];W[er];B[cp];W[eo];B[cr]LB[fq:a][eq:b][do:c][co:d]TR[dp]C[B13 and 15 seems a little heavy, B13 can consider to place at 'a', W 'b' will connect, then Black descent at 15. Later if White atari at 'c', Black can sacrifice the marked stone and instead atari at 'd'.]
;W[jq];B[en];W[fn];B[fm];W[gn];B[dk];W[ck];B[dj];W[cj];B[di]LB[fd:a]C[In the postgame analysis, B17 to B25 moves seem not good, it's better if Black clamp at 'a'.];W[dh];B[ef]
;W[fh];B[fd];W[fc];B[cc]C[The moves after B31 finalized the shape, neither were dissatisfied.];W[dc];B[bg];W[bh];B[cd];W[gd];B[fe];W[hc];B[bm]C[Able to snap 39, Black can keep balance in territory.]
;W[cn];B[do]LB[cm:a][dl:b][em:c][fk:d][qo:e]C[But B41 connection seems hard to understand now by myself, this move is almost a single point in the endgame ! B41 should push at 'a', then W 'b' turn, B 'c' connect and W 'd' make the knight move. Black can then protect the corner at 'e', this way Black is not bad. In the real game, after attached by W40 in sente, Black has no good follow-ups locally. What the most important is, White got the chance to approach at 'e', the speed is fast.];W[qo];B[mq];W[qf];B[qh];W[of];B[nc]
;W[rd];B[qc];W[qk];B[oh];W[mf];B[mh];W[gm];B[fl];W[dl];B[fj];W[bn]C[W58 blocks and captures one stone, it's huge, White is active and better.];B[ip]C[B59 is a move that waits for so long, actually it's not that severe as expected.]
;W[iq];B[hp];W[hq];B[gp];W[gq];B[fp];W[eq];B[in];W[im]LB[gl:a][gk:b]C[The moves from W68 to 76 appear heavy and awkward, W68 should press at 'a', Black make a tiger move at 'b', White then jump at 68, it's much better than real game.];B[jm];W[gk]
;B[fk];W[il];B[gl];W[hl];B[hn];W[hm];B[gh];W[kk];B[kp];W[jp];B[ko];W[kq]LB[nk:a]C[W80 and 82 are too slow, it should jump at 'a' to connect, this is related to thickness and thinness for both sides.]
;B[mk]C[After B83 capping in the game, the situation was reversed.];W[lq];B[mp];W[pm]LB[qm:a]C[W68 can't be omitted, otherwise invasion at 'a' is very severe.];B[bo]LB[qp:a]C[B87 should immediately make the diagonal move at 'a' to exchange with White, then play somewhere else.];W[an];B[kd]LB[pe:a]C[B89 is almost the losing move ! this move should first peek at 'a' to exchange with White's connection.];W[pe]C[In the game, after W90, White is basically alive.]
;B[ib]LB[qp:a]C[B91 still need to play the diagonal move at 'a'.];W[cb];B[bb];W[eb];B[ca];W[md];B[mc];W[jd];B[kc];W[gg];B[hh];W[rq]C[In the game, White snapped the knight move, W102 is fierce and tough ! this move is not just big, but also Black becomes thin as a whole, and it's not easy for Black to kill White.]
;B[ah];W[bi];B[hb];W[gb];B[pn];W[qn];B[om]LB[lp:a]C[After B107 and 109 strengthen, Black already incurred some loss in territory, and also has to guard against White's push at 'a'.];W[fo];B[pl];W[qm];B[ge]LB[qd:a]C[B113 should play at 'a' to attack White on the right.];W[he];B[je];W[hg];B[fg];W[ig];B[eh]LB[rc:a]TR[fh]C[In the game, although Black captured the marked White stone and becomes very thick, but being crawled by White at 'a', a small margin loss for Black is hard to change.];W[rc];B[po];W[pp];B[op];W[qp]
