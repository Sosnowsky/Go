Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[In the round 1 of Samsung Cup, the game between Hu Yaoyu and Lee Changho is considered to be the most important one.];W[dd];B[pq];W[oc];B[cp]
;W[qo];B[pe];W[mp];B[op];W[pm];B[qp];W[po];B[no]LB[rp:a]C[Not sure whether the diagonal of B13 is a novel play that Hu Yaoyu has studied, Liu Xiaoguang 9p (Hu's teacher) said Hu used this before in national games. The normal play is to descend at 'a'.];W[qi];B[jp];W[eq];B[mo]LB[gq:a][pp:b][kp:c]C[B17: Black badly wants to pincer at 'a', however Black is worried that White will first squeeze at 'b' then attach at 'c' to dodge himself. Because Black's shape in the lower right is defective, White has no good answer to this tactic.]
;W[dp]C[W18 is an old trick that Lee Changho used against Hu, he used it in Chunlan Cup and defeated Hu.];B[co];W[cq];B[bq];W[iq];B[ip];W[jq];B[kq];W[kr];B[kp];W[gq];B[lr];W[cr]C[White first handles himself with the sequence from W22 to W30 and also obtains some points, White should have nothing to complain. However in the process Black also becomes thicker, maybe Lee Changho didn't pay much attention to Black's thickness here?]
;B[cl];W[kc];B[pl]TR[no][mo]C[The attachment of B33 is the "knife" move! This is also the reason of the diagonal of B13 and the press of B17.];W[ql];B[qk];W[pk];B[pj];W[ol]C[White makes ponnuki with W36 and W38, White seems very happy, but because Black is already very thick at the bottom, White's ponnuki is not that valuable as it appears, besides White is still not completely alive yet.];B[qj];W[oh];B[oj]
;W[qg];B[mj];W[ml];B[ne];W[mh];B[mk];W[ll];B[kj];W[kh];B[mc];W[qb]LB[le:a]C[W52 is territory-oriented and Lee's style, Chang Hao 9p's opinion is to make the knight's move at 'a', connecting White himself and also aiming at the tactic in the corner. In the postgame analysis, we can see this move indeed affects the thinness and thickness afterwards.];B[le]
;W[ic];B[jd];W[rc];B[ih]C[With the cap of B57, Black seeks the tempo of playing.];W[ji];B[jk];W[rp];B[rq];W[pp];B[qq];W[ii]LB[re:a]C[The crawl of W64 is unnecessary, to cross over at 'a' directly is better.]
;B[gh];W[jc]LB[id:a][re:b][lg:c][ng:d][mb:e]C[The connection of W66 is a surprising move! Why not attach up at 'a'? At least to crossover directly at 'b' should be better than the real game play!. Because B 'c' and B 'd' are all absolute sente, White not only loses the attach-over at 'e' and also makes himself very heavy.];B[jf];W[re];B[qc];W[ra];B[lg];W[lh]
;B[gc]C[The invasion of B73 is very severe!];W[ie]C[With the sequence following W74, White has to make life in a hurry, but it only helps Black to play on the outside and White himself didn't get any substantial profit, White suffers a big defeat.];B[if];W[he];B[fd];W[je];B[ff];W[kf];B[kg];W[ke];B[ng];W[nh]
;B[jh];W[lf];B[mg];W[ki];B[ld];W[mb];B[nb];W[lb];B[nc];W[ob];B[cc]LB[cf:a]C[B95 at 3-3 is better than approaching at 'a', it is more attack-oriented! Hu is not soft-hearted in a favorable situation.];W[cd]
;B[dc];W[ch];B[cf];W[df];B[bf];W[ec];B[bd];W[ed];B[dg];W[gb];B[hb];W[bc];B[bb]
;W[gd]TR[ch]C[With the clever moves of W106, W108 and W110, although White connects back safely, but the corner is already taken over by Black, and the marked stone on the outside is also separated by Black. White is already hard to escape a defeat.];B[ge];W[hc];B[hd];W[fb];B[ri];W[qh];B[nm];W[nl];B[rn]C[With B115 and B119, Black pushes on in the flush of victory, White can only hold his own.];W[ro]
;B[rl];W[rm];B[sm];W[qm];B[sj]C[B125 is a good move! Leaving himself a tactic of making life.];W[be];B[ac];W[ce];B[ae];W[jl];B[kk];W[kl];B[il]
;W[ik];B[rh];W[rg];B[ij];W[hk];B[hj];W[im];B[gj];W[ck];B[rd];W[sd];B[sb];W[sc]

;W[lo];B[lp]C[Through B161, even if White's two groups are all alive in the end, White's territory would be still inadequate. In this game Hu gives a full play to his talent, it is his complete game!])
