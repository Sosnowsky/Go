;W[cf];B[kc];W[po];B[pl];W[mp]C[After the two-space high pincer of B9, White elects to play the very complicated "demon sword" joseki.];B[oo];W[on]C[Recently this joseki is seen more often, mainly because there are some new studies.];B[no];W[pp]C[As to both sides, this joseki is double-edged sword.];B[nq];W[qq]C[If handling not well, you will fall behind.]

;W[qp];B[om];W[rk];B[qk];W[rl];B[rq];W[rr];B[sr];W[sn];B[de]C[In the past, Black attaches with B39 to serve as ladder breaker, which was considered not good for White, not it has new variations.];W[ol];B[nm];W[mn]
;B[ln];W[mm];B[nl];W[lm];B[ce]LB[km:a]C[B47: Black can also play double-hane at 'a', the following variations are also very complicated.];W[jp];B[km];W[lo];B[ll]LB[kn:a][mk:b][ko:c][lp:d]C[B51 is not good, Black should connect at 'a', next W 'b' and B 'c' (White can't connect at 'd', since White is short in liberties), this result is better than the real game.]
;W[kn];B[ml];W[ln];B[lq]C[Following B55: Black lives very inconveniently!];W[lp];B[kq];W[jr];B[kr];W[jq];B[pr]LB[sm:a][sl:b]C[Black also has another major mistake, Black forgot to exchange B 'a' and W 'b'.]
;W[sq]LB[rj:a]C[White throws in with W62, later on Black's hane at 'a' is also gote, this makes a big difference.];B[mr]C[Through B63, the local variation comes to an end, Black already loses lot of points, which is enough to impact the outcome of this game with these two high hands.];W[cd];B[bd];W[ee];B[df];W[bc];B[be];W[ec];B[fd];W[fb]
;B[gb];W[eb]LB[ed:a][bb:b]C[W72 and W74 are right moves, if White connects at 'a', B 'b', White is painful.];B[fe];W[cb];B[dk];W[cm];B[pf]LB[qi:a][sm:b][sl:c][rj:d]C[B79: Originally Black can jump to 'a', if Black exchanges B 'b' and W 'c', since B 'd' is sente. Now Black can only make knight with B79 as in the game.]
;W[qi];B[ph];W[ok]LB[lf:a]C[The extension of W82 is Gu Li's unique style. Normally White will think to reduce at around 'a'.];B[nj]LB[oi:a][oj:b]C[The jump of B83 is not tight enough, and it helps White pierce through at 'a'. Black should attach at 'b'. As to Black, even if making some sacrifice, Black has to cultivate the top moyo, this way Black may have a chance to win.];W[oi];B[nh];W[ni];B[mi];W[mh]
;B[lh]C[B89: Black plays atari inward, Black's territory will be not enough unless Black can capture White.];W[mg];B[lg];W[mf];B[lf];W[me];B[oh];W[le];B[mc];W[jc]C[The attachment of W98 is good move to dodge, the winning move!];B[kd]C[Black has no other choices.];W[li]C[Following W100, White makes life easily, which also means White will win.]
