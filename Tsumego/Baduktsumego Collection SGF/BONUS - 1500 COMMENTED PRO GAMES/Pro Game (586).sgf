Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[In the best-of-3 challenger final, because Teacher Nie already lost game one, in this game he has to win in order to have a chance of winning Mingren Title.];W[dc];B[pq];W[dp];B[de]
;W[po];B[pl];W[oq];B[op]C[The fight starts from the lower right corner when White attaches down with W8 and Black hanes out with B9.];W[pp];B[nq];W[or];B[qq];W[nr];B[oo];W[on];B[mq]C[Because Black is favorable in the ladder, the extension of B17 is working.]
;W[pm];B[mr]C[After W18, Black turns and captures White's three stones with B19, Black has nothing to complain.];W[qp];B[rp];W[rq];B[rr];W[qr];B[sq];W[pr];B[rq];W[ro];B[qn];W[pn]
;B[rn];W[so]LB[rs:a]C[As to the block of W20, White didn't achieve anything with the sequence from B31 to B33. Therefore with W32, White must fight by playing hane at 'a'.];B[rs];W[mo]LB[qm:a]C[W34: Because White can only reinforce at 'a' unhappily, so he hopes to seek some variations by striking first.];B[nn]C[Black hanes out with B35, White again ends in gote with his counterattack, White incurs loss again.];W[mm];B[np];W[nm];B[ql]C[In the opening up to B39, White is already in a big losing situation.]
;W[jp];B[cn];W[fp]LB[dn:a][cp:b][kr:c]C[With W42, in an unfavorable situation, White should instead attach at 'a' or stand at 'b', in the game after the simple jump of W42, the value of W 'c' becomes smaller.];B[dk];W[ci];B[ei]C[After the invasion of W44, Black caps with the knight's move of B45, Black takes the chance to reduce White's thickness.];W[bk];B[ch];W[bh]
;B[dh];W[bg];B[cc];W[cd];B[dd];W[be];B[ec];W[db];B[cf];W[cb]LB[eb:a][fc:b][fe:c]C[The turn and atari of W58 allows Black to take one stone in sente with B61, White incurs loss in territory, with W58 White should turn at 'a' instead, if Black retreats at 'b', then W 'c', this is better than the real game.]
;B[bf];W[af];B[bc];W[bb];B[bd];W[ac];B[ce];W[ae];B[jr]C[When Black turns back and jumps with B67, Black's advantage becomes more clear.];W[fd]C[As to the peep of W68, the attachment of B69 is a feeling, White didn't gain anything.];B[gd];W[fc]

;W[qo];B[qi];W[qh]LB[pf:a]C[The sequence of W78 to W86 is a tempo of playing, it seems with B79 Black instead should make the knight's move at 'a', which is simple and clear.];B[rd];W[pi]LB[ri:a]C[W88: White has missed a chance, now White can only hane at 'a', this way Black is not completely alive, White would still have a chance of winning.];B[rh];W[ri];B[qj];W[rg];B[ph]
;W[qg];B[rj];W[oh];B[si]C[Through B97, all Black on the board is settled down, and Black is leading in territory, White is already in a hopeless situation.];W[ej]C[The crosscut of W98 is a game-deciding move! But it is far-fetched, because this black group is not lonely originally.];B[dj];W[di];B[fh];W[fj];B[cl];W[bj];B[cp]
;W[cq];B[bq];W[bp];B[co];W[br];B[dq];W[aq];B[cr];W[eq]C[White initiates a ko tenaciously with W112 and W114.];B[bq];W[hf];B[if];W[cq]
;B[ag];W[ah];B[bq];W[ie];B[he];W[cq];B[ab];W[aa];B[bq];W[gf]C[But in the process, White is damaging in the first place with W116, W122 and W128, even if White wins the ko fight, White's profit is still limited.];B[gg];W[cq];B[fk]
;W[dr];B[gk];W[dm];B[cm];W[kr];B[kq];W[jq];B[lr];W[fi];B[eh];W[hj]C[The sequence following W142 is the last game-deciding moves, but as to Black, it is easy to ensure his own safety, White is way behind in terms of territory. In this game, Teacher Nie didn't give a play to his talent.];B[gj];W[gi]
