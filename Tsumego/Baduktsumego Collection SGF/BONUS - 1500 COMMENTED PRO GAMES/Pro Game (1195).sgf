;B[cn];W[cl];B[cq]LB[fq:a][fp:b]C[B9 is a simple play, the counter-pincer at 'a' or 'b' is more popular recently.];W[cp];B[dq];W[ep];B[bp];W[bo];B[bq];W[co];B[fq]
;W[fc];B[qh];W[qn]LB[qm:a][qo:b]C[W20: If White makes the two-space extension at 'a', then Black would play the diagonal's extension at 'b'.];B[ql];W[on];B[nq];W[pk]LB[rp:a]C[W24: If White plays the knight's move at 'a', then Black would make the diagonal's extension at 24, the ensuing variation would be more complicated.];B[rp];W[pl]C[Through 26, Black has gained some territory, and White has obtained the outside influence.]
;B[en];W[fp];B[gq];W[dm];B[cg]LB[cf:a][ce:b][df:c][di:d]C[B31: If Black approaches the corner at 'a', then W 'b', B 'c' and W 'd', Black would come under attack.];W[cf]LB[ce:a][cj:b]C[W32: If White makes the diagonal at 'a', then Black would be very happy to make the two-space extension at 'b'.];B[bf]
;W[ce];B[dn];W[bm];B[cj];W[di]C[The attack after W38 is very fierce and relentless.];B[ci];W[dh];B[dg];W[dj];B[eg];W[ck];B[fi];W[eh]C[The push and cut of W46 is inevitable.]
;B[fh];W[fg];B[be];W[bd]LB[bh:a]C[After W50, White is left with the striking move at 'a'.];B[cc];W[cd];B[ff];W[gg];B[ee];W[hf];B[gd];W[id]LB[fd:a][gf:b]C[W58: If White plays at 'a', then B 'b', White is no good.]
;B[ec]C[B59 is the tesuji to fix Black's shape.];W[dc]LB[ed:a][fd:b]C[W60: If White pushes at 'a', then Black would sacrifice by playing at 'b', White can not be satisfied.];B[eb];W[db];B[ed];W[hd];B[da];W[ca];B[ea];W[bb]
;B[hb]C[Through 69,  from the whole board point of view, Black is leading in territory, but White's outside influence is strong, the key for the game lies in how White will manage his center.];W[gj]LB[gp:a][ek:b][dk:c][hi:d][jh:e][hq:f]C[W70 is the fatal mistake, White coverts small advantages, this is rarely seen in Lee Sedol's games, in this situation White certainly should press at 'a', if Black peeps at 'b', then W 'c', B 'd' and W 'e', this way White can utilize his thickness on the right side, White could also seek the chance to hane at 'f',  only by playing like this White would have a chance of winning.];B[ho]C[B71 is an excellent move, it has two purposes, reducing White's moyo and expanding his own, White instantly sinks into passivity.];W[kp]C[W72: White has no other choice.];B[gl]C[B73 is a good move, White is very painful.]
;W[fj];B[hh]C[The sequence after B75 has driven White crying without tears!];W[gh];B[hj];W[hi];B[ii];W[gi]C[Through 80, White is too horrible to look at.];B[oh]C[After B81, it is only a matter of time as to when White will concede defeat.];W[mh];B[nf];W[qc];B[pc]
