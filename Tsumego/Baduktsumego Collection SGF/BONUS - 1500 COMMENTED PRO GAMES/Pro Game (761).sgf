;W[cn];B[kq];W[qj];B[qk];W[pk];B[ql];W[pj];B[pl];W[qf];B[ok];W[nc];B[oe]C[Through B17, the opening is same as one game of Nong Shim Cup earlier this year between Zhou Heyang and Lee Changho, in that game, Zhou took Black and Lee took White.];W[ph]LB[qc:a]C[Lee Changho makes some improvement as to W18, in that Nong Shim Cup game, Lee Changho plays at 'a' to take 3-3 point.]
;B[qe];W[pf];B[ob]C[B19 and B21 taking the corner base are correct moves.];W[oq];B[pq];W[pp]LB[mq:a]C[W24: White aims to obtain sente and make one-space extension at 'a'.];B[qq];W[mq];B[op];W[np];B[po]
;W[on];B[or]C[Black's sequence from B27 to B31 is very simple and clear, White is not comfortable.];W[kr];B[jq]LB[jr:a]C[B33: If Black plays hane at 'a', then White will cut at 33, Black is not easy to handle.];W[jr];B[iq];W[ir];B[hq];W[nr];B[nq];W[lq]C[Through B40, both sides are roughly acceptable.]
;B[cq]C[B41: Black enters the corner and focuses on territory.];W[dq];B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[eq];B[bo];W[bn];B[co];W[do];B[dn]LB[cp:a]C[B51: Normally Black will directly connect at 'a', the play in the real game leads to a fierce fight.]

;B[fk];W[hm];B[jm];W[ei]LB[fs:a]C[W68 is the vital point for attack and defense, since having crossover at 'a', White has nothing to fear of.];B[gj]LB[hk:a]C[B69 is better than jumping at 'a'.];W[il];B[ij];W[jl];B[km];W[kl]
;B[lm];W[gh]C[W76 is a mutual good point.];B[kj];W[ll];B[mm];W[lj]LB[hi:a]C[W80: White has the mindset to peep at 'a'.];B[hh];W[hg];B[li];W[mj];B[ih]
;W[mi];B[lh];W[jd]C[The play of W88 is worth study.];B[gg]LB[cc:a]C[B89: To enter the corner at 'a' is also an enticing choice, but it seems a little insipid.];W[cc];B[fg]LB[gf:a][gi:b][hi:c][eg:d]C[B91 is the correct move, if Black extends at 'a', then W 'b', B 'c' and W 'd', Black is not good.];W[dg]
;B[hc];W[ib];B[he]C[B95 is the original move.];W[oc];B[pc];W[nb];B[lc]C[B99 is Cho Hunhyun's style.];W[pb]C[With the play of W100, White takes a big risk.];B[qb];W[oa];B[le];W[ld]C[Whether W104 is a good or bad move, we can only judge from the result.]
;B[md];W[lb];B[kb]LB[kd:a]C[B107 is relentless, for Black to take at 'a' is normal, the play in the real game makes both sides have no way to retreat.];W[kd]C[Following W108, White gets out of trouble by accurate calculation.];B[mc];W[mb];B[kc];W[me];B[nd];W[od];B[pe]

(;W[jb]LB[ne:a][nf:b][mf:c][mg:d][lf:e][kf:f][ke:g][lg:h][jc:i]C[W116: If White cuts at 'a' strongly, then B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f', W 'g', B 'h', W103 and B 'i', White will collapse (see var a).];B[mf]LB[ka:a][id:b][gc:c]C[If B117 at 'a', then W 'b', B117 and W 'c', Black's loss outweighs his gain.]
;W[ka]C[Through W118, in terms of result, White at the top already lives completely but ends in gote, and also Black becomes very thick, and it has a direct impact on the ko fight later on in the lower right corner, so Black has nothing to complain.];B[df];W[ef]C[W120: White aims to obtain sente.];B[eg];W[dh];B[ee];W[cf]C[Through W124, Black can take tenuki.];B[gn];W[gm];B[mr]C[B127 initiating the ko gives White a fatal blow, Black is clearly favorable in ko threats.];W[oq]
;B[eo];W[fo];B[nq];W[ns];B[os];W[oq];B[la];W[nq]C[After White eliminates the ko with W136, although Black at the top is ko-die, but White's loss at the top is even bigger.];B[ma]C[After Black captures White cleanly with B137, Black's advantage becomes clear.];W[in]C[W138: White makes the last-ditch effort.];B[go];W[fn]
;B[fp];W[ep];B[ko];W[hb];B[ja];W[gc];B[gd]C[Through B147, Black proceeds safely.];W[fc];B[pr]C[B149 is declaration of victory, White has to concede defeat. Cho Hunhyun is leading by 1:0, the game 2 will take place on 4/4.])
