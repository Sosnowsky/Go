;W[ce];B[dd];W[cd];B[ec];W[cf]LB[cc:a]C[In game 1, Yoo Changhyeok took Black and won the game by his favorite "Chinese Opening". In this game, W10 is rarely seen, most players think later on the fight will be to Black's advantage, so for White to play at 'a' is more common.

;W[ic];B[if]C[Through B45, both sides are roughly acceptable, but the result seems to favor Black.
];W[ke]C[W46: White wants to attack Black on the left side, but it is not easy, so in the real game White extends steadily.];B[cn]LB[gh:a]C[B47 is not good, Black can consider to play at 'a', this way Black's shape is relatively smooth.];W[gf];B[ff];W[gh];B[gg];W[hg];B[fg];W[hh]
;B[hf];W[jg]C[From W48 to W56, White is relatively thick.


];B[fq]C[B57 is inevitable.];W[eo];B[el];W[gl]LB[dn:a]C[W58 and W60 are slack, with W58 White can consider to press and attach at 'a'.];B[hp]C[After Black makes the knight's move of B61, Black's stone efficiency is not bad.];W[eq];B[fp]C[B63: For Black to make extension on the right side is better.];W[bo]
;B[bn];W[fr];B[ep]LB[gr:a]C[B67: For Black to hane at 'a' is common.];W[er];B[do];W[cp];B[gj]C[After Black squeezes and cuts White, Black starts to pound at White's thinness, it is a little hasty.];W[hj];B[hk];W[gk];B[fj]
;W[ik]C[After W76, Black doesn't take any advantage, White is favorable.


];B[fh];W[hl];B[qf];W[nq]LB[gq:a][gp:b]C[W78 and W80 appear a little careless, if White first exchanges W 'a' and B 'b', the exchange will favor White.];B[gr];W[qn];B[cr];W[bq];B[br]
;W[ar];B[np];W[mp];B[no];W[oq]LB[pq:a]C[When B87 and B89, with W90 White certainly should attach at 'a'.];B[pq];W[jq];B[pk];W[op]LB[ek:a][pm:b]C[Following W94, White aims to pull out at 'a', but White's fighting strategy is wrong, at least White should first play at 'a', but since Black originally shouldn't capture White's five stones, so White has no reason to escape his stones in the center. With W94 for White to make the diagonal at 'b' is common.

;B[po];W[oo];B[pn];W[on];B[pm];W[ek];B[jp]C[B101: If Black captures White's several stones in the center, White can take chance to separate and attack Black at the bottom.

];W[iq];B[ip];W[kq];B[fn]C[B105 is calm.];W[ob]C[White thinks to connect back several stones is not big, so White invades the top with W106, this way White clearly incus loss with the exchange from W94 to B99.
