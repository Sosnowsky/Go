;W[rh];B[pj];W[pe]C[W20 is a novel play, not sure whether Cho Chikun prepares it or not. As for as the result is concerned, it is not to White's advantage, however this has at least ruined Hu Yaoyu's original plan, making White spend a lot of time.];B[pd];W[ph];B[qg];W[rg];B[oh];W[qe];B[pg];W[re];B[od];W[ql]
;B[pk];W[rm];B[eb]LB[fd:a][ic:b]C[The descent of B33 is a little unreasonable. To hang at 'a' is the original move, if White still invades at 'b', then after Black's tiger's move at 'a', Black would be clearly favorable, for Black to enclose territory without invasion is much better.];W[ic]C[W34 is inevitable.];B[ie];W[gc]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.];B[ge];W[kc]C[With the attachment of W38, White settles himself easily.];B[lc]
;W[lb];B[kb];W[jc];B[mb]LB[ld:a][jb:b]C[B41 and B43: Black has no other choice but to destroy eye like this, if Black connects at 'a', then after W 'b', White would be already alive, Black can't tolerate.];W[ld];B[la];W[mc];B[lb];W[je];B[ke];W[fd]
;B[ed];W[fe];B[ff];W[if];B[hf];W[jd];B[le];W[kf]C[In the game, after the tiger's move of W58, Black doesn't gain any clear benefit by attacking.];B[ig];W[jf];B[kh]
(;W[lh]LB[me:a][lf:b][lg:c][mf:d][jh:e]C[W62: If White ataris at 'a', then B 'b', W 'c', B 'd' and W 'e', this variation is very complicated, both sides have no assurance of success (see var a).];B[ki];W[lf];B[me];W[li];B[lj];W[mf];B[of]LB[kj:a][do:b]C[B69 is a mistake and can be regarded as the losing cause of this game. Because the purpose of separation is to kill, but in fact it is already impossible, then using a dame move to separate White is meaningless, instead it makes Black itself thin. Black is better to connect at 'a', letting White to connect in gote with W69, then Black plays the high approach at 'b', this way the game is far from over.]

;B[om]C[After Black strengthens in gote with B83, Black is still not thick.];W[hg]LB[kg:a][kj:b]C[W84: The purpose of separating and sacrificing two stones is to make sure that W 'a' is sente, also later on the atari at 'b' is also sente, Black's outside is a little bit thin.];B[dg]LB[hh:a][gg:b][gh:c][fg:d]C[B85: Black should simply atari at 'a', then W 'b' and B 'c', this can test whether White dare pull out at 'd' or not, because Black is in an unfavorable situation, making the situation as complicated as possible can bring Black some chance.];W[ch]C[The exchange of B85 and W86 makes White very happy.];B[hh];W[gg]
;B[gh];W[ih];B[jg];W[kg];B[jh];W[jq]C[The extension of W94 is the last big point.];B[lq];W[gp];B[cn]LB[co:a]C[B97: For Black to approach tightly at 'a' is better.];W[cp];B[ck]
;W[nq]LB[qq:a]C[The invasion of W100 fully shows Cho 9p's style, in fact to enter the corner at 'a' is already adequate, the game is much easier for White to play.];B[oq];W[np];B[kq]LB[qq:a]C[B101 and B103 are crude moves, Black should make the diagonal's extension at 'a' to fight with White.];W[ml]C[The cut of W104 is again a good move! Black is very difficult to handle.];B[mm];W[kj];B[ii];W[ll]
;B[kk];W[po]TR[ll][ml]LB[nn:a]C[Because of the two marked stones, W 'a' is sente, as to the attachment of W110, Black couldn't counterattack.];B[qo];W[pn];B[jp]LB[qp:a][nn:b][nm:c][lo:d]C[B113: For Black to strengthen at 'a' is the original move, but after W 'b', B 'c' and W 'd', either Black's big group or the two stones at the bottom will die, Black is no good.];W[kl]
;B[jk];W[qq]TR[qo]C[The strike of W116 is severe! White captures the marked stone in sente, the game actually is already over.];B[nr];W[qp];B[qk];W[rk];B[pr];W[nn];B[nm];W[iq];B[qr];W[jl]LB[rr:a]C[W126: For White to hane at 'a' is already enough, the following brilliant variation reminds us the Cho Chikun in his prime time, his calculation is very accurate, he is not soft-hearted even in a favorable situation, this is my deepest impression to this game.]
