Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[Black is Yoo Chang hyuk 9P of Korea];W[dc]C[White is Zhou Heyang 9P of China];B[dq]C[Both Yoo Changhyeok and Zhou Heyang are not in a good state recently, don't know who will be the first to walk out of it.];W[pp]
;B[de];W[ce];B[cf];W[cd];B[dg];W[fc];B[cl]C[The play of the sequence from B1 to B11 was once used by Yoo Changhyeok in the past.];W[jp];B[hp];W[el];B[do]C[As to the cap of W14, Black's answer with the simple jump of B15 is correct.];W[qn]LB[oc:a][in:b]C[The play of W16 is worth study, to approach the corner at 'a' or make the knight's move at 'b' are all vital points.]
;B[oc];W[pi];B[in]C[Black gets to protect the corner and also take the vital point with the knight's move of B19, Black's opening can be satisfied.];W[ei];B[ci];W[cq];B[cp];W[hj];B[ko];W[lq];B[jj];W[hh]LB[kn:a]C[White's moves from W20 to W28 are over carefree, here even if Black strikes first, Black doesn't have any severe tactic, White certainly should consider to grab big points. Moreover, White has the state of mind to make the knight's move at 'a', because being pressed in sente by B25, White is painful.]
;B[qg];W[nc]C[The attachment of W30 allowing Black become thick is not good, however in this situation, due to White's earlier questionable moves, obviously White is already difficult to play.];B[nd];W[mc];B[md];W[ob];B[pc];W[kc];B[ld];W[pk];B[om]LB[pm:a][nq:b]C[The play of B39 makes White painful, if White answers at 'a', then Black will invade at 'b', White would be also difficult, White has no choice but to strike back bravely.]
;W[mm];B[mp];W[mq];B[qm]C[After pressing with the knight's move of B41, Black attaches down with B43, Black's play is not risky.];W[pn];B[pm];W[nk];B[on];W[np];B[no];W[oo];B[mn]LB[rn:a][nq:b][qo:c]C[Next  B51 is a product under a favorable situation, if Black hanes at 'a' instead, White can only block, Black cuts and ataris at 'b', then cuts at 'c' to fight, Black can fight.

After this move, it is time for noon break.]
;W[rn]C[White gets to play the descent of W52, White already slips out of one trouble.];B[km];W[jc]LB[rl:a][oq:b][nq:c]C[But next although W54 is big, it is the losing move, White can only jump over at 'a' grievously, this way when Black peeps at 'b', White can connect at 'c', Black temporarily can do nothing in the corner.];B[rm]C[After Black blocks down with B55, White becomes thin on the whole board.];W[mi];B[oq];W[op]LB[nq:a]C[When Black peeps with B57, the play of W58 is inexplicable! White certainly should connect at 'a', although the aji is bad, but White himself would be fine, in the game, Black lives in the corner, White's situation has deteriorated.]
;B[pq];W[qq];B[qr];W[qp];B[rr];W[nr];B[or];W[os];B[ps];W[ns];B[rs];W[dr]C[The sequence following W70 is common maneuver.];B[cr]C[So far, Zhou Heyang has used 2 hours and 30 minutes and Yoo Changhyeok 1 hour and 30 minutes.]
;W[hq];B[gq];W[gp];B[iq];W[hr];B[ip];W[fq]LB[ir:a][jq:b][eq:c][go:d]C[W78: White should turn at 'a', if Black turns at 'b', then White can atari at 'c' then directly extend at 'd'.];B[er];W[go]
;B[ir];W[fr];B[gm];W[fm];B[gl];W[gn];B[il]C[In the game, Black has protected the side and corner, and Black also has strengthened the center with B87, White's territory is already clearly not adequate.];W[ef];B[en];W[fn];B[eg];W[dk];B[ck]
;W[bf];B[bg];W[df];B[cg];W[ff];B[gg];W[fg];B[gh];W[fh];B[gi];W[pg]LB[if:a]C[W104: White should play at 'a' to enclose a big territory, this way White perhaps still have a chance.];B[qh]
;W[ph];B[gf];W[jh];B[fi];W[eh];B[je];W[id];B[gd];W[gc];B[lh]C[After Black presses down with B107, Black separates White with B115, it is severe, even if White makes life, White would still lose the game.];W[jf]C[Later on, Zhou Heyang's play is even worse!];B[mh]
