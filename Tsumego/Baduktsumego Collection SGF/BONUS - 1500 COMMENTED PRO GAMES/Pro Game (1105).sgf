;W[jc];B[ck]C[Through B21, I feel that Black's opening is successful.];W[de]LB[ei:a]C[W22: Normally White should jump to 'a'.];B[df];W[dd];B[cg];W[ef];B[fe];W[eg];B[dh];W[gg]
;B[di];W[jg];B[jd];W[kc];B[kd];W[cd];B[bd];W[bc];B[dg];W[fi];B[ld]C[B41 is a thick play.];W[qm];B[nq]
;W[mb]LB[qe:a]C[W44 is clearly small, I will elect to attach at 'a'.];B[ic];W[ib];B[lb]LB[lg:a]C[Black's sequence following B47 seems to fall into a trap, at this time Black should consider to cap at 'a'.
];W[lc];B[mc];W[kb];B[nb];W[mg]LB[md:a]C[W52 stresses at the cut point at 'a', White instead gains some profit with the sequence following W44.]
;B[qh];W[qe]LB[ph:a]C[The attachment of W54 is Gu Li's style, but it seems a little unreasonable, now to attach at 'a' should be good enough.];B[oh];W[pd];B[qc];W[md];B[ma];W[nd];B[ka];W[jb];B[nf]C[B63 is a good move, hitting White's vital point.]

;B[rg];W[od];B[pc];W[qf];B[sh]C[B81 is a clever move, White is painful.];W[se];B[sc];W[pi];B[ph];W[sd];B[mh];W[lg];B[lh]
;W[kh];B[sf];W[sg];B[lf]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.];W[dk];B[cl];W[kg]LB[rh:a]C[W96: White should take the ko at 'a'.];B[sf];W[dj];B[re]C[After Black takes with B99, White fails.];W[cj]

;W[ad];B[be];W[bo];B[gn];W[ip];B[in]C[Through B119, Black's shape is immune to attack, White is losing the game.];W[il];B[ep]C[B121 is a good move.];W[eo];B[do];W[fo]C[W122 and W124: White is tenacious.];B[cp]
;W[dq];B[co];W[cq];B[bp];W[bl];B[bq];W[br];B[ar];W[cr];B[bm];W[qq]C[White enters the corner with W136 desperately, playing regularly equals to waiting for death.];B[qp];W[pq]
;B[oq];W[rp];B[ro];W[rq];B[qn];W[pn];B[pm]C[B145 is a strong move, Choi Cheolhan's style is very strong and tough, whenever he gets a chance to exert power, he rarely makes compromise.];W[on];B[rm];W[ql]C[Through W148, the game is still to Black's advantage, but it is still to early to say Black will win the game.];B[op];W[pr]
;B[om]C[B149 and B151 are relentless.];W[nm]C[Now White wants to sacrifice the right side and aims to kill Black's left side, Black on the left side is not completely alive yet.];B[ol];W[nl];B[ok];W[nk];B[oj];W[ln];B[rl]C[B159: Black strengthens the right side completely, this perhaps gives Gu Li a chance.
];W[en]C[W160: White starts to strike.];B[fm]
;W[hm];B[hp];W[go]C[Now most likely Gu Li can turn the game around, Black has given White a chance. Gu Li's sacrifice from W150 to W158 is very beautiful, now White is very optimistic.];B[hn];W[jo]C[Now Black's dragon has 80% chance of dying. B159 gives Black himself a poison pill.];B[jl];W[jk];B[lm];W[jm]C[W170 is a clear play, now we can't see how Black to make life, I think this game will be over soon.];B[jn];W[kn];B[km]
;W[kl];B[im];W[jl];B[ko];W[kp];B[lo];W[mn]C[Choi Cheolhan lost such a good game, he must be very painful.];B[hq];W[ho];B[io];W[jp];B[hl];W[gl]
;B[lp];W[lq];B[mp];W[ir]C[Gu Li is the winner of this confrontation.])
