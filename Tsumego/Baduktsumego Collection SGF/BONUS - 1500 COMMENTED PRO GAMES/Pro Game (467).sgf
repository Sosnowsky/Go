;B[bd];W[cg];B[dg];W[ch];B[cc]LB[dh:a]C[B11: For Black to press at 'a' again is also playable.];W[bf];B[ce];W[dh];B[ef];W[ic]LB[dc:a][be:b]C[W16: Normally White will first exchange W 'a' and B 'b'.]
;B[cn];W[cl];B[fq]LB[cq:a][cp:b]C[B19: if Black enters the corner at 'a', White will block at 'b', in this joseki Black will end in gote and can't be satisfied.];W[fp];B[gp];W[fo];B[cq];W[eq];B[cp];W[gq];B[cm]LB[bo:a]C[B27: Black aims to prevent White from striking at 'a' in sente.]
;W[dl];B[qo];W[dr];B[cr];W[kq];B[mq];W[qi];B[qk];W[qf];B[qe];W[pf];B[nc]C[Through B39, the moves from both sides are very steady.];W[qc]C[W40 is unexpected, it seems Lee Changho is well-prepared, this is definitely not a on-the-spot idea.]
;B[re]C[B41 is an inevitable counterattack.];W[ob];B[oc]LB[nb:a]C[B43 is a thick play, if Black blocks at 'a', then White probably will push and cut at 43, Black has no assurance of success.];W[pc];B[nb];W[od]C[After White cuts with W46, the fight becomes white-hot.]
(;B[rf]LB[oe:a][pe:b][qd:c][nd:d][rc:e][rb:f][sb:g][qb:h][rg:i][pa:j][sd:k][sc:l][qa:m]C[If B47 at 'a', then W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 'e', W 'f', B 'g', W 'h', B47, W 'i', B 'j', W 'k', B 'l' and W 'm', Black is no good (see var a).];W[rg]

;W[pi];B[nd];W[ne];B[me];W[nf];B[mf];W[ng];B[ld]C[Through B69, it appears Black is favorable, in fact that's not the case, because Black still doesn't completely kill White in the corner.];W[dc];B[mg]C[With the sente move of B71 Black is very happy, from territory's viewpoint, White can fight, the key is how many points Black can enclose in the lower right.];W[nh];B[be]
;W[kc];B[lc];W[rb];B[pb];W[qb];B[oa];W[rd];B[se];W[sc];B[kp]C[B83 is the vital point for both sides' moyo.];W[jp];B[lp];W[jq]
;B[ol];W[kn]C[B87 and W88 are miai good points, each side gets to play one.];B[rl]LB[si:a][sj:b][nj:c]C[B89 looks small but big in reality, because W 'a' and 'b' are all sente, so Black not only fixes his own defect here and also aims to attack White's dragon by playing at 'c'.];W[nk]C[W90: White has to defend here.];B[lm];W[sj];B[sh];W[qm]C[W94 makes Black not comfortable.]
;B[nl];W[pk];B[pl];W[ql];B[rm];W[rk];B[qn]C[Through B101, White gains a little.];W[km];B[mk];W[mr]C[W104 is good timing.];B[nr];W[lr]LB[or:a]C[After W106, White is still left with the clamp at 'a', now we can see Black's territory in the lower right is not that big.]
;B[im]C[B107 is a game-deciding move.];W[in];B[hn];W[hm];B[jn];W[io];B[hl];W[gm];B[jm];W[jo];B[ko];W[kl];B[il]C[Through B119, both sides have some profit.]
;W[pm]C[The play of W120 is just right timing.];B[gl];W[fm];B[eh]C[B123: Black seeks a chance of fighting.];W[ei];B[fi];W[fh];B[eg];W[fj];B[gi];W[gj];B[ej]
;W[di];B[hj]LB[ek:a]C[If B133 at 'a', then W133, Black is no good.];W[hi];B[gh];W[ij];B[hk];W[ek];B[jk];W[kk];B[hh];W[mj]C[W142 is tesuji, Black already can't separate White.]
;B[ok];W[nj];B[oj];W[mh];B[ii];W[on]C[Through W148, White succeeds in the fight, Black is already not optimistic.];B[nn];W[oo];B[np];W[om];B[jb]C[B153 is alert.];W[ib]
;B[jc];W[jd];B[kb];W[id];B[cb];W[db]C[Through B160, Black gains a little.];B[ml];W[ki];B[jj];W[kj];B[bl];W[bk];B[op]C[B167 appears a sure-winning move, otherwise it is a slow move, Chang Hao's situation judgement seems wrong.]
;W[bm]C[The value of W168 is huge.];B[bn];W[al];B[bg];W[bh];B[af];W[ca];B[ba];W[da];B[ah];W[kd]LB[bi:a]C[W178 is better than retreating at 'a'.]
;B[bi];W[ci];B[gd];W[le]C[The play of W182 is very cunning.];B[qd];W[sd];B[gc];W[gb];B[fb];W[lb];B[mc];W[fd]C[W190 is strong and unyielding.]
;B[ge];W[hb];B[la];W[fe];B[gf]C[Through B195, Black ends in gote and can't be satisfied.];W[an];B[ao]TR[op]C[B197: Black blocks strongly, it contradicts with the play of the marked stone.];W[bo];B[am];W[ln]C[Through W200, it forms a complicated ko fight.];B[mn]
