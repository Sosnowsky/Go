;W[qn];B[pr];W[qq];B[kq];W[eq];B[dq];W[ep];B[do];W[jq]LB[iq:a][gq:b]C[The attachment of W14 is a common maneuver in this shape, if White makes extension at 'a', Black may invade at 'b'.];B[jr];W[ir]
;B[iq];W[jp];B[hr]
(;W[ip]LB[kr:a][is:b][lq:c][kp:d][in:e][no:f]TR[nq][pr]C[W20: If White plays at 'a', then B 'b', W 'c', B20, W 'd', B 'e' and W 'f', since the two marked black stones still have room for action, White is not easy to take control of the situation (see var a).];B[is];W[hq];B[gq]LB[ir:a]C[B23: Black is not falling behind, Black's connection at 'a' just fits White's intention.]
;W[ir];B[cf]C[The opening up to B25 is the same as that of 13th Kisung title match 1 held on 1/4 between Lee Changho and Mok Jinseok.]
(;W[hp]LB[fc:a][iq:b][gp:c][gr:d][go:e][fr:f]C[W26: White starts to vary first, in that game, Lee Changho played the small knight at 'a', followed by B 'b', W26, B 'c', W 'd', B16, W 'e' and B 'f' (see var a).];B[iq];W[gr];B[fc]C[Through B29, White is one step ahead at the bottom, Black gets to double-approach and attack White in the upper-left corner, Black has nothing to complain.];W[fd];B[gd];W[fe]
;B[ec];W[dc];B[ge];W[gf];B[hf]LB[ff:a][df:b]C[B37: If B 'a', then W 'b'.];W[df];B[dg];W[ce];B[ef];W[de];B[hg]LB[ff:a]C[B43 is a steady move, if Black cuts at 'a', the variation will be complicated, Black has no assurance of success.]
;W[ff];B[jc];W[ir];B[lr];W[cm]C[W48: White aims at Black's weakness in the lower-left corner.];B[cj]C[B49 is both a defensive and offensive play.];W[bo]C[The attack following W50 is White's privilege.];B[bp];W[dr];B[cr];W[dp];B[bn]
;W[cq];B[bq];W[bm];B[ao]C[Through B59, both sides are roughly acceptable.];W[bf]C[W60 is the vital point for attack and defense.];B[fj]C[B61 is light.];W[fl];B[pf]LB[qf:a]C[Comparing B63 with 'a', each has its advantage and disadvantage.

After this move, it is time for lunch break.];W[kc]C[W64: White seeks a breakthrough over here.];B[kd]LB[jd:a][jb:b][hb:c]C[B65 forces White to make a choice now, if Black plays at 'a', then later on White can consider to play hane at 'b' and strike at 'c'.]
;W[lc];B[jb];W[pc]C[White's dodging sequence following W68 is common tactic.];B[oc];W[ob];B[od];W[qb];B[nb];W[nc];B[mc];W[nd];B[mb];W[qd]
;B[qe];W[rd];B[oa];W[pb];B[re];W[rb];B[mg]LB[ne:a]C[B85: Black seeks high efficiency, to atari at 'a' is rather common.];W[gh]C[W86: White wants to destroy Black's moyo by attacking.];B[cg];W[bg];B[fh]
;W[hh]LB[gg:a]C[W90 is a strong move, to connect at 'a' is weak.];B[bh];W[jh];B[kg];W[bi];B[ci];W[ah];B[ch]C[Through B97, Black basically lives.];W[oq];B[or];W[np]
;B[mq];W[pj]LB[pk:a][qi:b]C[W102 is a mutual good point, now if White makes extension at 'a', then Black will make extension at 'b', White will be a little dissatisfied.];B[ql]C[The invasion of B103 is very strong and unyielding, here leads to a fierce fight.];W[rj]C[W104 is the strongest counterattack.];B[ol];W[rl]C[W106 is the right move to ensure White's own safety.];B[qk];W[rk];B[qm]
;W[rm];B[ml];W[nk];B[nl];W[br]LB[aq:a]C[W114: White aims to force Black to make life at 'a'.];B[dq];W[ng];B[nf];W[cq];B[cs];W[mh];B[lg]

;B[hb];W[eb]C[Through W136, it forms an exchange, White takes advantage in territory, but in terms of thickness and thinness, Black is favorable.];B[fr];W[hs];B[eo];W[fp];B[go]C[Black's sequence from B137 to B141 is very clever.];W[gp];B[em]C[B143: Black pounds at White's weakness, it seems Black takes initiative.];W[qr]LB[bk:a]C[W144: White takes tenuki to grab big endgame, it is very fierce and relentless. On the left side, White can jump over by fighting a ko, however Black's well-being on the lower right and right side is White's good ko threats.]
;B[qo];W[rn];B[qj];W[qi];B[pi]C[B147 and B149: Black counterattacks, not giving White any chance to take a breather.];W[of]LB[ph:a][oi:b][qh:c]C[The play of W150 looks like miscalculation, W 'a', B 'b' and W 'c' are general thinking.];B[nh]LB[og:a][ph:b][oi:c][oh:d]C[B151 is a good move, if Black plays at 'a', then W 'b', B 'c' and W 'd', Black falls into White's trap.]
;W[ph];B[oi];W[og];B[qh]C[Following B155, Black's calculation is accurate.];W[ne];B[pe];W[ld];B[md];W[mf];B[ri];W[ke];B[le];W[jd]
;B[kf];W[el];B[dl];W[dk];B[ck];W[dm];B[cl];W[hd];B[id];W[he];B[ie];W[en];B[fm]C[Through B177, White already has no mindset to continue the game. Lee Changho won Guksu champion by 3:1.]
