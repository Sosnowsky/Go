;W[cf];B[kc];W[qj];B[qm];W[qg];B[pi];W[qi];B[pf]C[The opening up to B13 was very popular several years ago.];W[ph]LB[pg:a]C[W14: White can also attach at 'a'.];B[fq];W[cn]LB[hq:a]C[W16: White can consider to pincer at 'a', this way Black's right corner is thin and White can fight.]
;B[dr];W[cq];B[iq]C[After B19, Black's configuration at bottom is not bad.];W[ic]C[The invasion of W20 is Black's weak point at top and can't be missed.];B[db]LB[dc:a]C[B21: Black normally will attach at 'a'.];W[cc];B[ed]C[As for the result in the real game, Black's shape is good and Black certainly can fight.];W[ie]LB[dc:a]C[But with W24 for White to play at 'a' is relatively better, this way Black is not easy to form a good shape.]
;B[de];W[ce];B[dc];W[cd]C[Hu Yaoyu perhaps feels he can turn to fight on the right side, so he handles the left side simply.];B[ff];W[mc]C[But White's play on the right side is not severe enough.];B[ld];W[pc];B[qc];W[pd]C[With W30, if White first plays W32 and W34 and aims to cap at 31, White's situation would be better.];B[qf]C[Here the key point is not allow Black's two groups at top to connect together.]
;W[re]C[W36 is good tesuji locally.];B[rf];W[qb];B[pe];W[rb];B[md];W[nc];B[od];W[oc];B[mg]C[B45 is calm. After Black strengthens himself, White on both sides appears thin.];W[oi]C[W46: White is difficult to play.];B[ig]C[It is obvious for Black to cap with B47 is very severe, but to allow Black to play at 46 makes White uncomfortable as well. However, as to White, the top is more urgent. So with W46 for White to jump at 47 is better.]
;W[ke];B[lf]C[It is said White took one hour to consider where to play W50. This shows White faces a very difficult choice.];W[jg]LB[gd:a]C[W50: White sticks head strongly and elects to fight directly with Black. But here Black's stones are clearly strong ......, White can first probe Black at 'a', then decide how to make life or stick head out, this is more steady.];B[jh];W[kg];B[kh];W[ih];B[if]C[B55 is strong and unyielding, here White is very dangerous.];W[fe]C[W56 is good move for dodging.];B[ge]
;W[gd]C[W58: White sets up a trap.];B[hd]LB[fd:a][gf:b][hf:c]C[B59 is good move! If Black simply plays atari at 'a', Black will fall into the trap. This way White will play atari at 'b', Black takes, White can stick head out at 'c'.];W[kd]LB[he:a][jd:b]C[W60: If White plays atari at 'a', after Black connects, Black can peep at 'b', so White has to squeeze first.];B[he];W[lc];B[kf];W[og]
;B[nf];W[kb]C[Through W66, Black forms influence, White steps over a crisis, the situation is still about even.];B[pk];W[qk];B[oq];W[jf];B[lh];W[fg]LB[gg:a]C[Although W72 is tesuji, for White to play at 'a' is better.];B[hc];W[hh];B[id]
;W[jd];B[gg];W[gh];B[eg];W[fh];B[ef];W[dh]C[Through W82, White fails to seal off Black completely, and Black is also left with the tactic of connecting together by a ko, White incurs loss.];B[dg];W[cg];B[eh];W[ei];B[di];W[ch]
;B[fo]C[B89: Black clearly takes the whole game into account.];W[ej];B[pl]C[Now Black's focus is the moyo at bottom, no need to tangle with White at top.];W[rm];B[rn];W[rl];B[el]C[B95 is good move and the reduction/expansion point for both sides. So far Black establishes superiority.];W[jo];B[kp];W[ko];B[lp];W[gl]LB[il:a]C[W100 at 'a' is better.]
;B[hm];W[gp];B[do];W[co];B[ho];W[kl]C[When B101, White escapes with W106, White's tempo is chaotic.];B[ik]C[B107: Black separates, White sinks into a bitter battle.];W[lo];B[ml];W[mp];B[mo];W[mm]

;W[jj];B[jm];W[gn]C[W128: White starts to fight desperately.];B[gm]C[B129 is correct move, Black is not soft-hearted.];W[go]C[W130: White has no other choice but to push into Black's territory, the decisive fight starts.];B[fn];W[jq]C[White's dodging sequence following W132 is brilliant.];B[hp];W[jp]C[White looks dangerous, but Black is also difficult to kill all.];B[mq];W[km]

;W[jn];B[gk];W[cr];B[jr];W[kr];B[ir];W[ln];B[mn];W[kk];B[lm]LB[ii:a]C[Through B159, they make compromise, next White only needs to connect back by fighting a ko at 'a'.];W[lq]LB[ii:a]C[W160: If White connects back at 'a', White's situation is still not favorable, but White will have more chances.]
;B[mm];W[hj]C[W160 and W162 are impulsive!];B[ii];W[ji]C[It forms a capturing race, but White's liberty is clearly not enough, it equals to suicide.];B[fl];W[kq];B[fi];W[fj];B[gj];W[hi];B[il];W[hf]
