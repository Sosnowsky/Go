Translation:GoGameWorld.];B[pd]C[In the semi-final game of the 10th Japanese Agon Cup which ended on 9/8, the defending champion Cho Chikun 9p meets again with his old opponent after defeating Kobayashi Koichi 9p, however this time, he is not that lucky.];W[dc];B[dq];W[pq];B[ce]
;W[dh];B[fe];W[fc];B[dj];W[fh];B[ed];W[ec];B[he];W[hh]C[As to the jump of B13, W14 is the vital point, here if Black gets to play the cap, White will definitely sink into passivity.];B[ic];W[ef]LB[ee:a][cd:b]C[The ensuing W16 is an asking move before reinforcing, if Black answers at 'a', then White will hit at 'b'.
]
;B[ff]C[As to the press of B17, White can tenuki, here Black is no good.];W[co];B[eg];W[dg];B[bc];W[bb];B[fj];W[eh];B[cm];W[eo];B[fp];W[em];B[dl]TR[fj]C[When Black already has the marked black stone, after White gets out with the good moves of W26 and W28, Black still need to strengthen with the diagonal's extension of B29 and is very painful.]
;W[cn];B[bq];W[hp];B[go];W[el];B[ek];W[ck];B[cj]LB[bm:a]C[When White strikes with W36, I can't agree with the play of B37, B39 and B41, it is too painful! Furthermore, Black's big group is still not completely alive. Black should descend at 'a' instead with B37, this way Black is still left with a route to go back and will not sink into passivity.];W[bm];B[cl];W[bl];B[bk]
;W[cc]LB[gm:a][ee:b]C[W42: White certainly should jump out at 'a', reserving the squeeze at 'b', this way White's big dragon would not come under attack.];B[ee]LB[gm:a][gl:b][hl:c][gk:d][gi:e]C[B43: In the game, Black has missed a good opportunity, Black should jump to 'a', which is the vital point for shape! If White attaches out at 'b', then B 'c', W 'd' and B 'e', White couldn't take care of both.];W[gm];B[ho];W[jp]LB[hk:a][bi:b]C[W46: White should first seal off with the knight's move at 'a', Black will not take some damage first, so Black can only reinforce at 'b', then White jumps out at 46.]
;B[hk];W[im];B[jh]C[After the caps of B47 and B49, White becomes passive.];W[ii]C[W50: White has no alternative but to get out with the diagonal's extension.];B[jk];W[ji];B[lh];W[ki];B[lk];W[kh];B[kg];W[li]C[Afterwards, White presses all the way with the sequence after W58, helping Black to build territory, White has clearly incurred some losses.]
;B[mh];W[kl];B[kk];W[mi];B[nh];W[ni];B[oh];W[oi];B[ph];W[pi]LB[il:a][if:b]TR[kh]C[W68: White should first peep at 'a', in the process, the push of the white marked stone is a big crude move! White has lost the tactic of invading at 'b', Black has established his superiority.]
;B[bi];W[il];B[qo]C[B71: When White peeps with W70, Black tenukis alertly.];W[qm];B[pm]LB[qd:a][ik:b]C[Black is clearly under a favorable consciousness with the sequence after B73, it would be most relentless that Black defends the corner at 'a' with B73, because White can't push at 'b' to kill Black, Black's advantage would be clear.];W[ql];B[oo];W[np];B[qn];W[pl]
;B[qq]LB[rq:a]C[B79 is a damaging move, Black should simply make the knight's move at 'a'.];W[qr];B[rq];W[pp];B[rr];W[pc];B[oc]C[The play after B85 is also very weak.];W[ob];B[od];W[pb];B[nb]
;W[qd];B[qe];W[rd];B[re];W[mb];B[nc];W[rb]C[Through W96, White lives in the corner, it already becomes a very close game.];B[hq];W[iq];B[hr];W[om];B[on];W[pr]
;B[rm]LB[mn:a]C[B103: If Black should jump at 'a', Black has no life and death problem.];W[rl];B[sm];W[ir];B[na]C[The descent of B107 is a huge move! However, White feels that he is already optimistic in the game.];W[hs];B[fr];W[ik];B[mn];W[bg];B[al]
;W[qh];B[qg];W[if]C[W166: White delivers a hidden killing move, but in fact White also takes a considerable risk.];B[ig];W[jf];B[jg];W[hf];B[hg];W[gf];B[gg];W[ge];B[gd];W[fd]
;B[id];W[fg];B[de]C[The sequence from B117 to B129 is one way street.];W[kf];B[lf];W[ke];B[ld]LB[kd:a][le:b][be:c]C[B133: If Black hits at 'a' instead, then White turns at 'b', Black descends at 'c' and Black has seven liberties, this way the capturing race would be quite complicated. However, Cho Chikun, who has little time left in the regular time, is hard to make this decision.];W[le];B[md]
;W[be]TR[bc]C[In the game, White captures the marked stone by reducing liberties and has gained a small profit.];B[me];W[gc];B[hd];W[cf];B[kd];W[dm];B[dk];W[rh];B[lp];W[lq];B[ll]LB[lo:a][mp:b][op:c][mq:d][hb:e][ml:f][nl:g]C[The turn of B147 is the last losing move, Black should retreat at 'a' instead, then W 'b' and B 'c', Black can make sure the cut at 'd' is sente, Black can gets to play the big endgame at 'e', when White jumps at 'f' to capture three stones in the center, Black can attach at 'g', this way the outcome of the game is hard to imagine.]
