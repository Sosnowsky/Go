;B[co];W[oc];B[de];W[ce];B[cf];W[cd];B[df];W[fc];B[ep]C[Following B13, Black expands his moyo.];W[eq];B[fp];W[gq];B[gp]
;W[hq];B[hp];W[iq];B[dj]LB[ip:a][jq:b]C[Before the extension of B21, Black still should press one more move at 'a' to exchange with W 'b', this will help the fight later on.];W[jo]C[The knight's move of W22 is good point!];B[nq]C[This way White contains Black's moyo development.];W[lq];B[ge];W[cl]C[The invasion of W26 is alert.]
;B[el]C[Black couldn't capture W26 one stone.];W[ci];B[cj];W[bj];B[di];W[bh];B[ch];W[bi]C[Through W34, White makes life easily.];B[hc]C[It seems Black fails in the fight.];W[ld];B[jc]LB[pe:a][pj:b]C[The play of B35 and B37 is too slow! At any rate with B37 Black should make diagonal at 'a', if White forces at 37 next, Black can connect the moyo all together at 'b', which will echo Black's thickness on the left side, it would be still a balanced situation.]
;W[pf]C[W38 is good move!];B[od];W[pd];B[pe];W[pc];B[qe];W[oe];B[of];W[ne];B[pg];W[nf];B[og];W[ql]C[Through W50, Black's earlier play comes to nothing, Black's territory appears inadequate.]

;W[le];B[je];W[kj]LB[jl:a]C[W102 is really unnecessary, to extend simply at 'a' is just fine.];B[pj]C[The striking move of B103 is game-deciding.];W[oi]LB[pi:a]C[The diagonal of W104 is mistake. White should connect at 'a', the situation wouldn't get overturned.];B[pi];W[oh];B[nk];W[ok]
;B[mj]C[Although White captures B103, B107 and B109 are sente.];W[qj];B[jl]C[Then Black can capture W102, White clearly incurs loss.];W[fe];B[ff];W[kl];B[kk];W[lk];B[jk];W[mr];B[dd];W[ec]
