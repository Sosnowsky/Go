;B[oo];W[qq];B[pp];W[qp];B[on];W[qn];B[pl];W[pe];B[pd]C[The push and cut of B15 is a little unreasonable, the fight here is relatively to White's favor.];W[od];B[oe];W[pf];B[ne]

;B[kh];W[lj];B[hc];W[kg]LB[ng:a][om:b]C[W36 is questionable, perhaps White doesn't notice Black's counterattack at 'a', White should attach at 'b', this way White is very favorable.];B[ng]C[After the attachment of B37, White doesn't have any good follow-up.];W[nh];B[lg];W[lh];B[mg];W[jg]
;B[oh];W[oi];B[ph];W[pi];B[qh];W[qi];B[ri];W[rj];B[rg];W[si];B[rh];W[qk]C[Through W54, White has no choice but to sacrifice four stones, Black's territory is huge.];B[mc]
;W[mb];B[kc];W[kb];B[ld];W[lb];B[qr];W[rr];B[cf]LB[or:a][qs:b][kp:c]C[I can't agree to the play of B63, with this move, Black should hang at 'a' to exchange with W 'b', then make an extension at around 'c', this is simply and clear, and Black is favorable.];W[np]C[W64: White starts to counterattack, the situation becomes complicated, but Black relatively has more territory, Black is still easier to take control of the game.]
;B[pn];W[qo];B[op];W[nq];B[ln];W[kp];B[or];W[qs];B[ll];W[hp];B[fq];W[im];B[jk]C[B77 is a light and clever move. Now Wang Xi (White) tries to complicate the situation, but White at the top is still not completely alive, Black's advantage is obvious.]
;W[kl];B[jn];W[fp];B[in];W[gq];B[eq];W[gn]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.];B[hm];W[fr];B[er];W[pa];B[qe];W[ic]
;B[id];W[hb]C[W90 and W92 are necessary, otherwise if Black descends at 92, White locally is not alive.];B[gc];W[be]C[W94 is a good move, settling down with just one move.];B[cn];W[km];B[kn];W[nr];B[kk];W[il];B[jm];W[ch]
;B[bf];W[ee];B[dg];W[ge]C[Now the situation is relatively chaotic, but the most surprising is: now White's situation is not bad.];B[ff];W[gf];B[gd];W[fg]LB[fe:a]C[W110 is a bad move, this is almost the losing move, White can only connect at 'a'.];B[fh]C[White perhaps overlooks Black's counter-clamp of B111, after Black's clamp, White already can't move at all.];W[gg];B[eg]
;W[gk]C[White loses common senses with W114, perhaps because White is not feeling well with the early play of W110 and W112. If White connects with W110, although White is still a little inferior, but I feel the outcome of the game is still hard to judge, now White is already very difficult to turn the game around.];B[jp];W[jq];B[kq];W[kr];B[iq];W[jr];B[ip];W[ir];B[fe]LB[cj:a]C[B123: For Black to clamp at 'a' is rather simple and clear.];W[jl]
;B[lm];W[ik];B[lk];W[ei]C[White starts to attack Black in the upper left corner with W128, it is a desperate play.];B[gh];W[hh];B[hi];W[ih];B[eh];W[ii];B[hn];W[cj];B[fj]
;W[cm];B[bm];W[cl];B[gb];W[dn];B[nc];W[eb];B[ce];W[cd];B[bd];W[bc];B[ae];W[ef]
;B[ga]C[The simple descent of B151 is a good move, White's top group has been cleanly captured.];W[bh];B[ac]C[B153 again is a good move to make life, after this move, this black group already can't be killed.

I feel Wang Xi doesn't give a full play to his talent in this game, hope he plays better in the second play.];W[bb];B[fd];W[dc];B[dk];W[ck];B[di];W[dj];B[ej];W[jc]
;B[if];W[hg];B[fl];W[gl];B[gm];W[fk];B[ek];W[el];B[fm];W[hj];B[dl];W[he];B[hd]C[The final game 2 will take place on 12/9.]
