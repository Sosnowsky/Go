];B[qd]C[In this year's Nong Shim Cup Ring Contest, Chinese players' performance is not bad, so far each Chinese player won at least one game. On 28th, Luo Xihe 9p challenges successfully, now Chinese team is in a favorable position.];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[fc]

;B[oo]LB[np:a]C[The press of B19 is an old joseki, because most players think Black is damaging, so nowadays very few players will play this variation, the recent popular play is to connect at 'a' and the following variation is very complicated.];W[on];B[mq];W[lq];B[no];W[mr];B[pn]C[Through the cut of B25, Black ends in gote and there is still a lot of aji, Black incurs a little loss.];W[kc];B[cc];W[dc];B[cd]
;W[de];B[db];W[eb];B[cb];W[ec];B[cf];W[qf]C[The invasion of W36 is a good point.];B[qh]C[The forcing move of B37 is not bad itself, but because Black's lower-right corner has a lot of aji left, for Black to attack White is not that easy.];W[pd];B[pc];W[qc];B[rc]

;B[rb];W[qj]C[White's handling sequence from W38 to W56 is very clear and fast.];B[ph]C[B57 prevents White from crossing over, showing Cho Chikun 9p's tenacious style. However, it seems White doesn't fear of fight.];W[oj];B[nh];W[kf];B[lh]LB[mi:a]C[B61: For Black to make the diagonal extension at 'a' is a little better.];W[mi]C[White gets to strike with W62, Black appears heavy.];B[mh];W[jf]
;B[nn]LB[kj:a]C[Although the reinforcing of B65 is the original move, but making the knight's move at 'a' is still better.];W[rl];B[qm];W[oi];B[oh];W[lj]C[After White makes the diagonal extension with W70, it is already not smooth for Black to stick the head out.];B[kj]LB[jh:a]C[The attachment of B71 is unreasonable, Black can only jump to 'a', although for Black to near White's thickness is also not comfortable, but Black has no other choice.];W[ki]C[The hane of W72 is a strong move, Black is difficult.];B[li]

Choi Cheolhan 9p thinks: B75 is a fatal mistake, Black should play at 'b', next W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'a', W 'f', B 'g', W 'h', B 'i', W 'j' and B 'k', Black is favorable (see var a). Moreover, when W 'c', for Black to play at 'a' is also possible, followed by W 'f', B 'l', W 'm', B 'n', W 'o', B 'g', W 'h' and B 'p', Black can also fight (see var b).]
;W[ri];B[qi];W[qk];B[rh];W[kk];B[jj];W[jk];B[ij];W[jh]C[In the real game, Black ends in gote, after the atari of W80 and the press of W82, White makes the diagonal extension with W84, Black is completely in an inferior position.];B[ik];W[ll];B[jl];W[ln]
;B[id]C[The knight's move of B89 is a desperate move in an unfavorable situation.];W[je]LB[ig:a][kh:b][mc:c]C[White turns and cuts with W90 and doesn't give an inch, it is very strong and unyielding. In fact if White makes the diagonal extension at 'a', preventing White from playing at 'b' then the wedge and cut, Black is also no good. Luo Xihe must feel White's attachment at 'c' is very happy, so he decides to push and cut White.];B[jd];W[kd];B[hd];W[mc];B[nd];W[ib];B[ig]C[With the sequence following B97, both sides have no way to back down, it seems Black is still a little far-fetched.]

;W[gm]C[Finally White blocks Black with W134, Black's several groups in the center, at the top and on the right all will be killed, Black can only concede defeat. In this game, Luo Xihe's play is very brilliant.

The game 10 will take place on 11/29.])
