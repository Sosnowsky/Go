;W[co];B[qj];W[nc];B[pf];W[jd];B[jp];W[cf];B[gq]C[In the opening up to B13, both sides enclose their own moyo, this is relatively popular nowadays.];W[ne];B[pb]LB[ng:a]C[Black turns direction with B15, as to this, Wang Xi had his unique understanding. The common move is to cap at 'a'.];W[ng]
;B[nj];W[lo]C[W18: White starts to reduce Black's moyo.];B[kn];W[oo];B[po];W[lq];B[kq];W[pn];B[on];W[pp]C[W26 playing atari first is necessary.];B[qo];W[no]
;B[op];W[om]C[Through W30, White is favorable in ladder breaker, it seems White can be satisfied.];B[dc]C[B31 serves as ladder breaker.];W[ec];B[ed];W[fc];B[de];W[cd];B[ce];W[cc];B[bf]C[Through B39, it forms a weird variation, the gain or loss is unclear.];W[qn]
;B[cm];W[pg];B[rn]LB[rm:a][pm:b]C[B43 is an asking move, if White blocks at 'a', Black can play at 'b'.];W[qf];B[of];W[qh];B[qe];W[re];B[rd];W[pq]C[W50: White sacrifices several more stones in order to guard against Black's above variation.]
;B[pr];W[qq];B[rq];W[ro];B[rp];W[rm];B[nf];W[oj];B[ok];W[pk];B[me];W[rf];B[fd]C[Following B63, Black is not satisfied and continues to seek ladder breaker. However, the situation is different, running out is not that severe as before.]

;B[hg];W[dh];B[nn]C[B79: Black finally pulls out the ladder-breaker stones.];W[mm]C[W80 is a good move, locally, for Black to capture two white stones is not necessarily to Black's favor.];B[oi]C[After B81, Black has to take action on the other side. Overall, White can fight.];W[pj];B[pi];W[pl];B[qi];W[og];B[mg];W[nh]
;B[ni];W[mh];B[lj];W[lg];B[mf];W[rc]LB[ki:a]C[W94 is a local good move, Black already has no answer. However White's timing is questionable, White should first make the knight's move at 'a' to reinforce the cut point, this way White is favorable.];B[lh]C[B95: Black counterattacks alertly.];W[qc]C[After W96, White has no other choice but to give up stones.];B[qd];W[pc];B[sd]

;B[lf]C[Luckily, in terms of the sacrificing result up to B113, White still can be acceptable.];W[bh];B[bc]LB[ch:a][ci:b][bg:c]C[B115 is a mistake. Black should push at 'a', next W 'b' and B 'c', this way making life is clearly better than the real game.];W[bg];B[cb];W[db];B[bd];W[dc];B[bb]
;W[ji]C[After the connection of W122, White turns to be favorable for the game.];B[mc];W[mb];B[lc];W[lb];B[ob]C[B127 is a good move to continue provoking.];W[oc];B[nb];W[kb];B[qb];W[rb];B[ra]
;W[qa];B[pa];W[na];B[ma];W[nd];B[sb]LB[kc:a][jb:b]C[B139 is a mistake. Black should push at 'a', now White can only extend at 'b', Black takes some advantage in points and also extends one more liberty. If the game still proceeds as in the real game, this one liberty is very important.];W[sc];B[kc];W[ke]C[W142 is a good move.];B[md]
;W[jc]C[Through W144, since Black's liberty is tight, although there is a ko fight in the corner, but it makes no big difference from dying unconditionally. White is taking a big lead.];B[hi];W[sg]LB[ih:a]C[W146: For White to simply connect at 'a' is also possible.];B[se];W[si];B[sj];W[rk];B[sh];W[ih];B[si]C[B153 reinforcing himself is very big. Black already has no tight-liberty problem. the ko fight in the corner becomes reality. Following W146 White shouldn't give Black this kind of chance.];W[em]
;B[dk];W[nq]LB[fk:a]C[W156 is inexplicable and the turning point for the game. White should cap at 'a'.];B[fk]C[After White jumps out with B157, the situation becomes chaotic.];W[go];B[fr];W[ej];B[ek];W[cl];B[ci];W[ch];B[bl]

;B[ep];W[iq];B[jr];W[in]C[W182 is White's wishful thinking, Black wouldn't respond again.];B[gm];W[fn];B[hk];W[ip];B[ir];W[ko];B[np];W[mo];B[gl]
;W[fo];B[gg];W[eo];B[di];W[bi];B[dp];W[dn]C[Through B198, it forms a ko fight.];B[cn];W[bo];B[en];W[hh];B[gh];W[dn]
;B[gc]C[The cut of B205 is a very good ko-threat reservoir, Black takes the upper hand.];W[hc];B[en];W[hf];B[gf];W[dn];B[gb];W[fb];B[en];W[eq];B[fp];W[dn];B[ib]

;B[en];W[hj];B[gj];W[dn];B[ga];W[hr];B[cr]LB[hq:a][fq:b]C[The descent of B237 is the winning move. If Black cuts at 'a', White will capture four stones at 'b' and is thick on the board, White can win the ko fight in the upper-right corner, this way White will win the game by a small margin.];W[hq];B[dr];W[en];B[da]C[In the real game, after Black captures one white group with B241, White can't easily win the ko fight in the upper-right corner, White's territory is inadequate.]
