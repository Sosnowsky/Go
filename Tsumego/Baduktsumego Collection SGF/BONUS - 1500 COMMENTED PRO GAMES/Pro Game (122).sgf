(;W[fb]LB[dh:a][ad:b][ae:c][bi:d][ca:e]TR[oc][qn]C[The crawl of W28 is a old joseki. Nowadays the popular play is to connect at 'a', then B 'b', W 'c', B28, W 'd' and B 'e', forming an exchange (see var a). In the past, if there is no exchange of B5 (the marked black stone) and W6 (the marked white stone), White will surely approach the corner at 5 with the next move, but not Black has already taken the excellent point with B5, therefore White should not select this joseki.];B[ci];W[dh]
(;B[fe]LB[di:a][fh:b][ei:c][dk:d][ej:e][cn:f][ck:g][dj:h][dl:i][ek:j][dn:k]C[B31: Black will usually connect at 'a', then W 'b', B31, W 'c', B 'd', W 'e' and B 'f'. However later on White is left with the maneuver of W 'g', B 'h', W 'i', B 'j' and W 'k', Black is still not safe (see var a).];W[fh];B[cl]

(;B[hd];W[id];B[ie]LB[he:a][hf:b]C[B37 and B39 are over-steady. For Black to jump at 38 lightly is the shape, if White pushes at 37, then B 'a', W39 and B 'b', fixing his own shape and putting more pressure on the center white as well, White doesn't gain anything.];W[je];B[hf];W[ii]LB[hi:a]C[The shape of W42 is light but seems over-aggressive. For White to make the small knight's move at 'a' is relatively steady.];B[ig];W[jd];B[ae]

(;B[qp]LB[gi:a][gh:b][hi:c][hh:d][ih:e][gk:f]C[B47: Black clearly breaks away from the main battle field. Black should take the opportunity to cut at 'a' when White's step of W42 is too wide, followed by W 'b', B 'c', W 'd' and B 'e', no matter which direction White extends to, Black will jump to 'f', this way White's two center groups will be definitely constrained by Black (see var a).];W[pj];B[qh];W[on];B[mp];W[jf];B[jg]

(;B[ge]LB[af:a][ab:b][gi:c][eh:d][eg:e][fj:f][fd:g][gj:h]TR[ii]C[Black doesn't want to give up anything with B63, it is not right! Black should retreat at 'a', after W 'b', then Black attaches out at 'c' by sacrifice, followed by W63, B 'd', W 'e', B 'f', W 'g' and B 'h'. This way although White will get a territory of about 20 points , but Black not only has gets rid of the heavy burden and also has built influence in the center, separating the marked stone is also valuable, this variation is clearly better than the play in the real game (see var a).];W[gi];B[kh];W[kj];B[oi]LB[mh:a][ph:b][pg:c][qg:d]C[The original move for B67 is to jump at 'a', but Black is worried about White's attachment at 'b', then B 'c' and W 'd', White can cut and kill Black's big dragon by sacrifice.

(;B[ik]LB[ij:a][hi:b][hg:c][gl:d][cn:e]C[B81 is "hypocritical", Black should play the tight hane at 'a', forcing White to connect at 'b', then B 'c' and W 'd', Black can take tenuki and grab the excellent one-space extension at 'e' (see var a).];W[gl];B[lk]LB[cn:a][kk:b][if:c][jj:d][ij:e]TR[ik]C[In the game, if Black takes the vital point at 'a' with B83, then White will cap at 83. As for the shape, Black must cut and capture White's stones at 'b', but after White plays the atari at 'c' in sente, next White can kill Black at 'd' instead! If the original marked black stone was played at 'e', White has no way to escape.]
;W[cn];B[el];W[ij]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.];B[il];W[jj];B[kl];W[bj];B[bi];W[bl]C[W90 and W92 is very relentless. White has gained a lot of territory and Black is still not alive.];B[ck];W[bk];B[cm]

;W[ho];B[qj]LB[rl:a][oj:b][nm:c][mn:d][lp:e]C[B117 is the losing move! Black certainly should fight desperately with White by jumping to 'a'. If White connects at 'b', Black can attach at 'c' and separate White strongly; If White strengthens at 'd', Black capture White's stones at 'b', after White attaches at 'e', Black would have no way to make life in the center. Although this way we can't say Black is good, but at least the game would still be very complicated.];W[qk];B[pk];W[rj];B[qi];W[ql];B[pm]
