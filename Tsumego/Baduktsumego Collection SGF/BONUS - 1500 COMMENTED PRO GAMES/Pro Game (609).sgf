;W[cn];B[fc]C[Black continues to approach corner with B5 and B7, it is Yamashita's style.];W[id]LB[df:a][pj:b][ec:c][kd:d]C[W8: For White to answer at 'a' is also possible, but White is worried Black may form the "sanrensei" by playing at 'b', then when White makes the diagonal-hit at 'c', Black will take tenuki and play at 'd', in the game White directly attacks with the pincer of  W8, it is a positive move.];B[pj];W[ec];B[fd]C[B11: Black can't ignore it.];W[df];B[kd]C[The counter-pincer of B13 is very strong and unyielding.]
;W[if];B[gg]C[B15 is a good move, sticking head out fast.];W[eg];B[ge]LB[ih:a]C[W16: Normally White will directly jump to 'a', in the game,White makes the exchange of W16 and B17, it is hard to judge whether the exchange is good or bad.];W[ib]LB[ic:a]C[W18 is to guard against Black's attachment at 'a'.];B[hh]C[B19: Black sticks head out very smoothly, Black's first-playing effect is quite obvious.];W[ih]C[The attachment of W20 is inevitable.];B[ii]
;W[jh];B[ji]C[So far, Chang Hao uses 20 minutes and Yamashita Keigo uses 24 minutes.];W[kh];B[ki];W[lh]C[Through W26, both sides' moves are very tight.];B[fi]LB[nd:a][hi:b]C[B27: If Black strengthens at around 'a', White will cut at 'b', Black has no assurance of success.];W[nd]LB[md:a]C[W28: If White plays at 'a', White is worried that Black may fight by sacrificing.];B[me]
;W[ne];B[mf];W[nf];B[mg]C[From B29 to B33, both sides are not willing to retreat.];W[pf]C[W34 is a good point for both sides.];B[jc]LB[lc:a]C[B35 is to guard against White's knight's move at 'a'.];W[hd];B[og]LB[mj:a]C[B37 is an asking move, seeking the playing tempo and also clearly aiming to seal off by the knight's move at 'a'.];W[ng]
;B[mh];W[nh]C[Although White is very happy by pushing out with W38 and W40, White must pay some price.];B[mi];W[gb];B[fb]C[The exchange of W42 and W43 is clearly damaging to White.];W[hf];B[gf];W[md]LB[lc:a][mc:b]C[W46: If White makes the knight's move at 'a', Black has the good move of crosscutting at 'b'.];B[ld];W[kf]

;B[rb];W[ph]C[Through W74, White makes life in gote, Black is clearly favorable.];B[pq];W[kq];B[hg];W[lg];B[iq]C[B75 and B79 are steady moves in a favorable situation.];W[no];B[dh];W[lc]C[W82 is hard to understand and may be a product under time pressure.];B[bh]LB[db:a]C[B83: For Black to jump in at 'a' perhaps will be more severe.]

;B[lb]C[Black strengthens with W161 in sente and is very happy.];W[mc];B[kc];W[gc]LB[hb:a]C[W164: If White takes tenuki, Black will wedge at 'a', White dies unconditionally.];B[dm];W[cm];B[dl];W[bj];B[bo];W[bn];B[bp]C[From B165 to B171, Black forces White to make life.]
