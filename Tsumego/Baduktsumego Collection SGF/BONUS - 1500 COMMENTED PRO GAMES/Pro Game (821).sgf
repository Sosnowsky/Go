;B[ce];W[ed]C[The moves W6 and W8 are rarely seen, Song 3p tried these moves before in his usual practice.];B[kq];W[fq];B[hq];W[cq];B[dq];W[cp];B[do];W[dr];B[er];W[cr];B[eq]
;W[cn];B[rq];W[pn];B[qn];W[pm];B[qm];W[pl];B[qk]C[Through 27, from configuration, Black can be satisfied.];W[nc];B[pc]LB[jd:a]C[B29 can also be considered to pincer attack at 'a' directly.];W[ne]
;B[jd]LB[pf:a]C[The play of B31 is uncommon, the normal move is to jump at 'a'.];W[pf];B[md];W[nd];B[of]C[B35 is a related conception to the previous several moves.];W[hp]C[W36 seems to serve also as a ladder breaker.];B[ip];W[oe];B[pe];W[og];B[qf]
;W[nf];B[qg]C[Through 43, it forms a positioin of Black's territory vs White's outside influence.];W[gp];B[gr];W[io];B[jp];W[pk];B[qj];W[hd];B[jf];W[cd];B[oi]C[B53 separating White into two parts is a good move.]
;W[lc]C[W54 is a mutual good point.];B[po];W[oo];B[nn];W[on];B[ch]C[Through 59, it seems Black can fight.];W[jh]C[W60 is a good move.];B[lh];W[kg];B[he];W[ge];B[hf]
;W[id];B[hh];W[cj];B[ji]C[B69 is worth study, it is the source of the ensuing chaotic fight.];W[fh]C[W70 is brutal and relentless, Black on the left looks thin instantly.];B[gf];W[eg];B[di];W[dj];B[ei];W[gi];B[ej]
;W[hi];B[ld];W[ii];B[mc];W[jc];B[ke];W[lg];B[kc]C[Through 85, White has gained some profit.];W[ek];B[fk];W[el];B[bd];W[cf]
;B[cc];W[de]C[Through 92, it leads to a complex ko fight.];B[dd];W[lb];B[kb];W[cd];B[fl];W[mb];B[ie];W[em];B[dd];W[fr];B[fs]
;W[cd];B[co];W[be];B[fm];W[en];B[fn];W[bo];B[dn];W[cm];B[dm];W[cl]C[For the result up to 114, White has some gains in territory, but Black obtains sente, the situation is still not clear.];B[mg]C[The sequence following B155 starts pounding at White's thinness.]
;W[nh];B[mh];W[ni];B[jj];W[mf];B[ih];W[kh]C[It is time for lunch break.];B[lj];W[mj];B[li];W[kf];B[oj];W[mk]
;B[km];W[hk];B[il];W[hl];B[hm];W[ic]C[W134 forces Black to seek life.];B[gd];W[gc];B[fe];W[fd];B[gh];W[fi];B[fg]
;W[ik];B[jl];W[ll];B[jk];W[fj];B[ob];W[nb];B[ig]C[Through 149, although Black makes life, but the four stones on the left are captured, the territories for both sides are very close. However, White on the right is still not completely alive, so the key for the game is how to settle the shape on the right.];W[mn];B[nq];W[lo];B[kn];W[lq]
;B[mq];W[lp];B[lr];W[kr];B[jr];W[ql];B[rl];W[rm];B[rk];W[jb]C[The play of W164 is not favorable.];B[bp];W[bn];B[ja]
;W[ia];B[ka];W[la];B[kd];W[eo];B[fo];W[gq];B[hr];W[ep];B[fp];W[dl];B[es];W[ds]
;B[gs];W[rr]LB[qp:a][rp:b][ro:c][rn:d][hb:e][or:f][nm:g][pr:h]C[W182 is unreasonable, if White loses the game, this would be the losing move, now it can only diagonals at 'a', followed by B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f', W 'g' and B 'h', thus it is still a half-point game.];B[qq]LB[mm:a][lm:b][nl:c][nk:d][oq:e][pp:f][mo:g]C[B183 has missed a winning opportunity, Black should hane at 'a', followed by White's block at 'b', Black's tiger at 'c', White's push at 'd' and Black's squeezing at 'e', making a miai of the cut at 'f' and the atari at 'g', Black will certainly get to play one, Black wins the game for sure.]
;W[qp]C[W184 is excellent timing.];B[rp];W[pp];B[rn];W[pr];B[or];W[no]C[After White reinforces with W190, the outcome of a small-margin loss for Black can not be altered.];B[ha];W[fb];B[ib];W[hc];B[fa]
