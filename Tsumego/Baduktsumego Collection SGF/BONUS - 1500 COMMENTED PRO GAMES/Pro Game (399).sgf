;W[mn];B[lo];W[qr]C[After the exchange of W20 and B21, the following descent of W22 is the right move. Because Black already exchanges B5 for W6, later on playing the ladder breaker is very severe.];B[co];W[jq]LB[gq:a][iq:b][ns:c]C[W24 is an overplay, White aims to attack Black's seven stones at the bottom, but it is not practical. Now to make a two-space extension at 'a' is appropriate. For Black to enclose territory at 'b' is not big, White is still left with the big endgame with the knight's move at 'c'.];B[gp]C[The invasion of B25 is inevitable, however playing one line lower would be more initiative.];W[ip]C[W26 is a correlated move of W24.];B[ln]
;W[qn];B[ep];W[lm]C[W30 is a strong move.]
(;B[jo]LB[km:a][kn:b][jm:c][kl:d][jn:e][ko:f][io:g][kr:h]C[B31 is weak, from the state of mind, Black wants to play the hane at 'a', then W 'b', B31, W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f', W 'g' and Black makes life at 'h', Black can fight adequately (see var a).];W[gr]C[W32: White handles lightly as planned.];B[eq];W[er];B[dp]C[B33 and B35 are thick moves.]
;W[cq];B[dr];W[fq];B[es];W[fr];B[cr];W[fp];B[km];W[kl];B[ll];W[mm];B[jm]C[Through B47, the local exchange comes to an end, Black is a little favorable.];W[kk]
;B[qi];W[cf]LB[ph:a]C[W48 should be reserved, White should directly make the knight's move at 50, later on White still can attack Black with the pincer at 'a'.];B[kc]LB[jc:a][oc:b]C[B51: Black should pincer tightly at 'a', either way White can make life in the corner by attaching at 'b', so one space wider would be better.];W[db];B[nh]LB[fe:a]C[Although Black strengthens with one move B53, the corner still has a loophole. Black is better to simply jump out at 'a'.¡£];W[he];B[ef]
;W[oc];B[nd];W[qc];B[pd];W[dh]LB[fe:a][cg:b]C[The counterattack of W60 is the right move, if Black captures B5 by playing at 'a', then after Black attaches at 'b', Black's loss will outweighs his gain.];B[ed];W[de];B[gf];W[rd];B[re];W[hf]
;B[gg];W[ih];B[hi];W[hh];B[gh];W[gi];B[eh];W[di];B[ej]C[After the sequence from B71 to B75, both sides are roughly acceptable.];W[pi]C[The attachment of W76 is a good move.];B[hj]LB[qh:a][ph:b][oi:c][rc:d]C[Perhaps Black feels difficult to answer and takes tenuki unexpectedly. Here it is so urgent, Black still should answer at 'a'; If answering at 'b', White will cut at 'a', Black is painful; If making the diagonal's extension at 'c', then White's connection at 'd' in the corner will become sente.]
;W[qh];B[ph];W[rc]LB[ri:a]C[In the game, Black is one step slow, before W80, White should atari at 'a' first.];B[qg];W[nb];B[jf]LB[eb:a][ee:b]C[B83 may come to nothing. Black should first make the diagonal's extension at 'a', Black perhaps has neglected White's tactic of pushing at 'b', White basically has connected already.];W[oh];B[rh];W[ni]
;B[og];W[ee];B[gd];W[ec]C[So far, White is leading in territory.];B[go];W[fo];B[gn];W[lr];B[hq];W[hr];B[kq];W[kr];B[iq]

;B[oe];W[ob];B[nj]C[B115 is a game-deciding move, if playing the endgame normally, Black is hard to win the game.];W[mk]LB[oi:a]C[However White retreats with W116, the difference between both sides has been dramatically narrowed down, White should connect at 'a', Black doesn't have any severe tactic.];B[nl];W[ml];B[mi];W[pe];B[ne];W[qe];B[pf]
