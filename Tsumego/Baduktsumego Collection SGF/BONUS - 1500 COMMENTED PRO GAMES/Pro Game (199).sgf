Translation:GoGameWorld.];B[qd]C[The final match of the 2nd Jeongganjang Cup Women Go Contest is held in China, but no Chinese players participate, hope this kind of situation ends as earlier as possible. In the first game on Jan. 5th, Park JiEun 4p turned the game around in an inferior situation and defeated Yun Yeongseon 3p, leading the series by 1:0.];W[dd];B[fc];W[cf];B[pq]
;W[od];B[oe]C[As to the corner-approach of W6, the upper-attachment of B7 is one special conception.];W[qc]C[W8: For White to attach underneath in the corner is always far-fetched when the ladder is not favorable.];B[pd];W[pc];B[oc];W[nd];B[ob];W[rd];B[re];W[rb];B[sd]
;W[rc];B[qe];W[mc]C[The sequence from B9 to W20 seems inevitable.];B[mb]LB[pb:a]C[B21: If Black turns at 'a' instead, then White will play at 21 to initiate a ko fight, the attachment of B21 in the game is a variation.];W[pb]C[As to this, White counterattacks with W22, not allowing Black to capture the fives stones in the corner completely.];B[nc]C[B23 is a strong move with an inefficient shape.];W[md]LB[lb:a][kc:b][lc:c]C[The connection of W24 is clearly a very bad move! After being extended by Black at 'a', White's corner needs to make life in gote, on the outside the jump at 'b' is not working either, Black has established her superiority very earlier on in the game. With W24, White certainly should extend at 'c', this way Black can't help but to crawl on the second line painfully, the situation would be complicated.]
;B[lb];W[pa];B[kc]LB[kd:a]C[However, next Black has made bad mistakes consecutively. First, B27 is slow! Black certainly should make the knight's move at 'a'.];W[mf];B[oh];W[oa];B[nb];W[je];B[id];W[ie];B[hd];W[dp]
;B[qn];W[ec];B[fb];W[jq];B[lq];W[fp];B[ok];W[qh]TR[oh][qn][ok]C[Then B29, B37 and B43 (the marked stones) are really impractical, after being invaded by W44, Black has too many defects, Black can't attack White strongly.];B[nf];W[mg]
;B[le];W[me];B[ng];W[qk];B[rl]C[Even like this, when Black attaches with the knight's move of B51, White still has no absolute assurance of success.];W[qo]C[In the game, White attaches with W52, seeking an exchange.];B[rn]LB[pn:a][po:b]TR[qh][qk]C[As to this, B53 is a fatally bad move! Black certainly should extend at 'a' or hane up at 'b', allowing White to live the corner in gote, this way, Black will capture the marked two stones naturally, Black would be definitely favorable for the game.];W[op]
;B[oq];W[np]C[After this move, it is time for noon break, to be continued on 1pm.];B[nq];W[pl]C[In the game, after White gets out with the diagonal's move of W58, Black already can't chase and kill White.];B[po]LB[on:a]C[However B59 again is slow, Black should jump to 'a'.];W[ol];B[mk];W[nl];B[mi];W[pf]C[In the process, White takes the chance to peep with W64 in sente, Black is very painful!]
;B[pe];W[mh];B[ni];W[lm]C[When White stalks off with W68, the game has already been turned around.];B[jp];W[iq]LB[ip:a]C[Then White starts to give way, W70 should be played as the hane move at 'a'.];B[kp];W[kl]LB[rk:a]C[W70: For White to play at 'a' is also a living shape.];B[ki]
;W[jg];B[ip];W[hq];B[qj];W[rk];B[rj];W[pj];B[pi];W[sj];B[si];W[sk];B[qi];W[pp]
;B[qp];W[mp];B[mq];W[co];B[on];W[nn];B[il];W[jk];B[ld]LB[ii:a][ik:b][hg:c]C[B95 is no good, Black should jump to 'a', then W 'b' and B 'c'.];W[ji]
;B[cg]LB[kh:a][jh:b][kg:c][dj:d]C[If Black extends to 'a', then W 'b', B 'c' and W 'd', Black is no good.];W[df];B[bf];W[be];B[cj];W[cl];B[bg];W[dg];B[bk]LB[bl:a][ck:b][bj:c][bi:d][bm:e][dl:f][cm:g][di:h][kh:i][db:j]
;W[bl];B[bd];W[ae];B[kg]C[When Black tries to obtain sente and captures several stones with B109 in the center, the situation is already not clear.];W[kh];B[lh];W[jh];B[kf];W[bi]C[W114: White certainly should attack strongly.];B[ci];W[dh];B[ai]LB[ej:a]C[B117 is the losing move! Here there is always a sente eye, Black certainly should directly jump to 'a' to fight with White, because White is not that very thick on the outside as imagined, Black can fight.]
;W[ah];B[bj];W[aj];B[ak];W[ej]C[White grabs the vital point with the knight's move of W122, on the side the ko is worry-free for Black, Black is losing the game! ];B[ai];W[qq];B[rp];W[aj];B[ce];W[cd];B[ai];W[ke]
