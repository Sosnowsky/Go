;W[ci]C[The three-space lower pincer of W6 is Choi Cheolhan's favorite.];B[fc];W[ed];B[fd];W[ee];B[fe];W[ef];B[ff]C[Following B7, Black presses consecutively with great momentum, Gu Li's fighting spirit is high.];W[lc]LB[eg:a]C[W14 is weird, for White to take tenuki is always not appropriate, to retreat at 'a' is relatively better.];B[cb];W[db]
;B[eg]C[B15 and B17 are severe!];W[cf]LB[dg:a][dh:b][cg:c][bc:d]C[W18: White is very inconvenient, but if White plays hane at 'a', Black's double-hane at 'b' will be a good move! Next W 'c' and B 'd', White's shape will collapse.];B[df]C[B19: Black fights directly and simply takes advantage, Gu Li easily obtains initiative.];W[dg];B[de];W[cc];B[cg];W[dh]
;B[bd];W[bc];B[bf];W[bh];B[bg];W[fg]C[W30: To win the game, White has to cut.];B[eh];W[ei];B[fh];W[gg];B[fi];W[fj];B[gi]
;W[ig];B[id];W[bb];B[ej];W[di];B[fk]C[B41 and B43: Black captures one stone in a ladder, White's outside is in tatters and White sinks into a bitter battle.];W[je];B[jd];W[ke];B[dl];W[ck];B[cm];W[bm]
;B[bn];W[ek]C[W48, W50 and W52 are good moves locally, to just make life is not good, White must separate Black in order to have a chance.];B[gj];W[el];B[dk];W[dj];B[em];W[fl];B[fj];W[gl];B[bj];W[jb];B[ib]
;W[jc];B[hf];W[hg];B[ic];W[kd];B[ec];W[dd];B[eb];W[bi];B[ij];W[bk];B[co];W[aj]
;B[fo];W[il];B[kj];W[fq];B[ho];W[kl];B[ca];W[ba];B[if]LB[mj:a]C[B85: If Black jumps to 'a', Black can still keep advantage.];W[jg];B[lh]C[B87 is unnecessary, White is very thin everywhere, now the most important is to make yourself thick.]
;W[mk]C[W88: White's consciousness of win-and-lose is very intense! Now White must strike back. Although to strengthen the upper side is the original move, but that way Black's center will also become thick, White is difficult to turn the game around.];B[mi];W[lj];B[ki];W[pn]LB[ll:a]C[W92 is to guard against Black's severe cross-cut at 'a', Choi Cheolhan is very sensitive to cut points.];B[nc]C[B93 is big, White's situation is still not good.];W[me];B[nf];W[kg];B[mf];W[ne]
;B[of]LB[pf:a]C[B99 is an impulsive move! Black should jump to 'a', this way locally Black wouldn't end in gote and can first act in the lower right corner.];W[ie];B[he];W[ia];B[ha];W[ja];B[hb];W[od];B[pb];W[pe]C[W106 and W108: White tangles with Black.

After this move, it is time for lunch break.];B[qg]
;W[qe];B[re];W[ob];B[pd];W[oc]C[Through W114, White lives with 14 points, White is successful.];B[oe];W[np]C[After W116, the situation becomes very close.];B[cq];W[iq];B[pq];W[dq];B[hm]
;W[hl];B[cp]LB[cr:a]C[B123: Black connects thickly and it is probably of favorable consciousness, in terms of points, to descend at 'a' is clearly better.];W[or]LB[nn:a][nr:b]C[W124 is a game-deciding move, normally White will jump to 'a', but after Black's knight's move at 'b', White's territory will be inadequate.];B[oo];W[om];B[no];W[mp];B[mo];W[lp]C[In the real game, White ignores the well-being of his center big dragon and takes lead in territory with W128 and W130, forcing Black to attack White. And then the outcome of the game will be decided by dodging and making life his big group in the center, Choi Cheolhan fights tenaciously.]
;B[mm];W[ml];B[ok]C[B133 is the vital point, at first glance White seems very painful, but since Black's corner is still not alive, now White is not that easy to be defeated.];W[nm];B[lm];W[lo];B[mn];W[kk];B[kn];W[jo];B[jn];W[pk];B[pj]
;W[qk];B[ol]C[Black has to bump with B145, otherwise White will live very happily, Black is not good.];W[oj];B[nj];W[oi];B[pl];W[ql];B[pm];W[li]LB[qm:a]C[W152: If White descends at 'a', it will be also a very complicated fight, however comparing with the real game, this is relatively better.];B[kh];W[mh]
;B[nk];W[nh];B[qm];W[lg];B[lk];W[ll];B[mj];W[lk];B[ii]C[B163 is the key point.];W[rm];B[qn];W[qi]LB[ik:a]C[W166: If White reduces liberty at 'a', locally White will ko-kill Black, but the sente diagonal of W166 is too big, the real game play is better.]

;W[ph]LB[ro:a][rq:b]C[After W104, due to tight liberty, W 'a' and W 'b' are working, Black incurs a little loss. Now if the endgame is played normally, White will win the game with a small margin.];B[ri];W[rj];B[og];W[ni];B[pg];W[pa];B[qa];W[oa];B[qb];W[ro]

;W[ih];B[gm];W[hh];B[km];W[bl];B[cs];W[qp];B[po];W[ko]LB[dn:a]C[But W236 is the fatal mistake! White should strike at 'a', the value of these two endgames is close, but when it is half-point game, this can decide the game.
