];B[qd]C[Since 2003, Chinese players again fail to advance to the final eight. In this game, Wang Lei deals with Lee Changho using his own play, but the opponent is also well prepared and happy to face the fight.];W[dd];B[pq];W[oc];B[md]
;W[qo];B[qk];W[ne];B[pf];W[me];B[ld];W[qc]C[W10 and W26: White elects to first press then attach in order to seek variations, the following sequence from W18 to W26 is the reason why White chooses this kind of play.];B[pd];W[pc];B[nd];W[od];B[oe];W[le]
;B[kd];W[ke];B[jd];W[of];B[pe];W[og];B[pg];W[oh];B[qi]LB[nb:a][ph:b]TR[qk]C[B27: Black hopes he can jump to 'a', but White definitely will take tenuki and sacrifice the corner by turning downwards at 'b', this way the marked black stone will get captured and an exchange would result, this is not to Black's advantage.];W[mb]
;B[fc]LB[lb:a]C[When W28, B29 is a mistake! Although being taken advantage, Black still can only block at 'a'.];W[kb];B[jb];W[if]C[In the game, White takes a big profit in sente with W30 and W32.];B[hd];W[ec];B[fd];W[fb];B[gb];W[cf]C[When White proceeds safely with W34 to W38, Black is already falling behind.];B[dp]
;W[fq]LB[jq:a]C[White's joseki selection from W40 to B53 is questionable. With W40, White should play steadily with the splitting move at 'a'.];B[ip];W[cn];B[fp];W[gp];B[fo];W[dq];B[eq];W[er];B[ep];W[gr];B[cq]
;W[dr];B[go];W[dj];B[hp];W[cp];B[gq]C[Black takes one stone in sente with B57, after Black's outside becomes thick, White's outside influence at the top is also subject to attack.];W[fr];B[co];W[bp];B[bo];W[bq];B[qp]C[B63: Black gets to attack White first.]
;W[oo];B[nk]C[B65 sticking the head out is a good move!];W[rp];B[rq];W[pp];B[qq];W[oq];B[mg]C[Next the striking move of B71 is too severe.];W[lh];B[lg];W[kg];B[mh]
;W[mi];B[ni];W[li];B[nh];W[jh]C[White can only tolerate with W72 to W80, White's original outside influence becomes thin instead, White's advantage in the opening stage all disappears.];B[mq]LB[ch:a]C[B81: Black should directly invade at 'a', this way all kind of possible variations would be reserved.];W[nq];B[ro];W[rn];B[sp];W[mp]
;B[qn];W[lq]LB[ef:a]C[In the game, a lot of variations are lost, and With W88 White can also take tenuki to grab the excellent point by jumping to 'a', White is not difficult to handle, this way White would be favorable.];B[ch]C[The invasion of B89 is an absolute move! The fight over here probably will decide the game.];W[dm];B[dn];W[eh]LB[dg:a][rc:b]C[The cap of W92 is feeling, but this is a mistake. White should make the diagonal extension at 'a' instead, forcing Black to make life at the top in gote, after strengthening the center in sente, White can stand at 'b', this way White is not bad, this is probably also the choice White made when reinforcing with W88 and thinking White's situation is not bad.
];B[dg];W[fg];B[cj]
;W[dk];B[eg]C[Black's sequence following B97 are consecutive good moves, Lee Changho is forced to only parry Black's blows painfully.];W[ff];B[de];W[cd];B[ce];W[be];B[bf];W[bg];B[bd];W[af];B[bc];W[bb]
;B[cb];W[ee];B[df];W[cg];B[dh];W[ed];B[bh];W[cc];B[ab];W[ba];B[ca];W[ad];B[aa]
;W[db];B[ah];W[ag];B[ei];W[fj];B[fa];W[bb];B[ba];W[eb];B[fh];W[gh];B[bl]C[Through B133, White incurs a heavy loss, Black is already clearly favorable for the game.];W[fi]
;B[br]LB[cm:a][rc:b]C[B135 is a big mistake! Only if Black simply cuts and captures one stone by playing at 'a' or grabs the biggest endgame at 'b', Black would achieve an overwhelming victory.];W[cr];B[aq];W[bm];B[cl];W[cm];B[ck];W[ir];B[ap];W[cq];B[di]
;W[en];B[do];W[gm];B[hm];W[gl];B[im];W[al];B[ak];W[am];B[bj];W[rc];B[gi]C[In the game, B135 suffers White's tenacious resistance, and Black suddenly plays several bad moves in a row, especially the cut of B157 to start a ko! Finally Black ruins this good game.

Afterwards, White performs an almost perfect show, we can easily see Lee Changho's excellent talent in the second half of the game. Even if Black plays the endgame normally, Black can't avoid his defeat.];W[eh]
