Translation:GoGameWorld.];B[qd]C[Black is Lee SeDol 9P of Korea];W[dc]C[White is Hu YaoYu 7P of china];B[pp]C[Before commenting on this game, I invited Hu Yaoyu to explain what he has learned from this game. Hu Yaoyu told me that the content of this game is very simple, so it means he won this game pretty easily. Taking a general view of the whole game, Hu Yaoyu's style of "firmness cloaked beneath gentleness" didn't give the opponent any chance to utilize power, comparing with Lee Sedol's undisguised strength, what Hu Yaoyu demenstrates is another kind of strength.];W[dp]
;B[de];W[ce];B[dd];W[cd];B[ec];W[cf]C[The large avalanche joseki is the one which has the biggest divergengence of opinions among Chinese and Korean players. Most Chinese players think this variation is to White's advantage, however Korean players consider it is even result, therefore in the games between Chinese and Korean, this joseki is seen with the highest frequency.];B[df];W[dg];B[cc];W[db];B[bc];W[cb];B[cg]

;B[ca];W[oc];B[md];W[qk]LB[mc:a]C[The purpose of the splitting move of W34 is to break up the situation. In most cases, White will attach at 'a', but according to the most recent study, Black has strong moves locally, so in the game Hu Yaoyu avoids a direct confrontation.];B[qi];W[qn];B[qo];W[pn];B[np];W[lq];B[oj];W[ol]
;B[mo];W[ml];B[pc]LB[kp:a][jq:b][io:c]C[B45 is a slow move, which is the reason that causes Black to sink into passivity in the opening. Black should press with the knight's move at 'a', then W 'b' and B 'c'.];W[qq];B[qp];W[lo]C[The attachment of W48 is a good move! Hu Yaoyu excerts power first.];B[ln];W[ko];B[nm]
;W[ok];B[kn];W[jn]C[The hane of W54 is strong and unyielding, Black feels constricted in getting his head out.];B[jo];W[jq];B[io];W[jm];B[kl]LB[mm:a][ll:b]C[The jump of B59 is an obvious mistake. After the game, Lee Sedol is overcome with regret about this move, he said he misread a simple variation, in the game he thought Black doesn't need to connect at 'a'. With B59, Black should attach at 'b', this way White is not that easy to separate Black.];W[km];B[lm]
;W[ll];B[kk];W[il]LB[oo:a]C[After the diagonal's extension of W64, Lee Sedol sees clearly the tactic of the diagonal at 'a', but it is already too late. After White separates Black, White takes control of the game at one stroke.];B[mm];W[lj];B[iq];W[ir];B[hr];W[ip];B[jp];W[hq];B[hp]LB[lp:a][ho:b][co:c]C[The atari of B73 is in disorder, the proper move for Black is to capture two stones at 'a', but the hane of W 'b' is very simple, White can sacrifice three stones in sente, then make the diagonal at 'c', White's corner would be huge, Black can't tolerate.]
;W[kq];B[iq];W[oq];B[pq];W[ip];B[ik];W[hl];B[iq];W[pr];B[qr];W[ip];B[cp]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.];W[iq]C[After thinking in the noon break, Hu Yaoyu decides to simply eliminate the ko with W86, not leaving Black any chance.]
;B[dq];W[co];B[do];W[ep];B[cn];W[bo];B[bn];W[eo];B[dn];W[cq];B[bp];W[bq]C[An exchange has resulted in the corner, although Black takes two white stones, but White has enclosed a side territory of nearly 45 points, Black's territory is clearly not adequate.];B[ao]
;W[dr];B[bj];W[ci];B[li]C[B103: Black tries to enclose territory at the maximum limit.];W[kj];B[ki];W[jj];B[mj];W[mk];B[ih]LB[od:a]C[The knight's move of B109 is clearly unreasonable, the proper move is to hang at 'a', but that way Black's territory is still not enough, so Black has to play this game-deciding move.];W[pb]
;B[qb];W[pd];B[qc];W[mc];B[nd];W[lc];B[jc];W[od];B[ob];W[nc];B[nf]C[In the game, Lee Sedol has been pondering for several times in order to kill, but the room for White to live is too big and Black itself also has many weak points, therefore in the whole process Black failed to contain White in the dead corner.

;W[of];B[ng];W[ld];B[ne];W[qf];B[oh];W[ke]C[In this crucial moment, Hu Yaoyu's play is steady and accurate, W130 is the vital point for eye shape.];B[jf];W[nb];B[pa];W[kc];B[je];W[re]
;B[rg];W[qg];B[rh];W[og];B[qe];W[rf];B[jb];W[nh]C[Next the cut of W144 gives Black the final blow, in the end White instead has captured Black's ten stones, Lee Sedol is forced to concede defeat. (In this move, W144 was regarded as a clever and famous cut by some pros)];B[mh];W[ni];B[nj];W[pi];B[pj]
;W[ph];B[qj];W[oi];B[jk];W[lk];B[hk];W[mi];B[ql];W[ji];B[kg];W[rk];B[pk];W[rl]C[Hu Yaoyu advanced to the semi final, which will take place in 11/4-11/7.]
