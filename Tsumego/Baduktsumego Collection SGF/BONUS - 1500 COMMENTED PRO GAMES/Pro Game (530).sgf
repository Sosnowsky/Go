;W[dq];B[bo]C[Through B21, it is a common joseki.];W[iq];B[ql]C[Comparing with the game between Luo Xihe and Lee Sedol yesterday, this game is much slower.];W[qg];B[pq]C[B25 is inevitable.];W[lq]LB[fc:a][kq:b][mc:c]C[W26: White has state of mind to directly protect the corner at 'a', next B 'b' and W 'c', both sides expand their own moyo, this is also playable.];B[cf]
;W[fc];B[bd];W[cc];B[ef];W[ei];B[bh];W[ch];B[bc]C[Through B35, both sides proceed quite normally.];W[ic]C[After White extends with W36, the situation leads to a close-game pattern.];B[ph];W[qh];B[pj]C[The press of B37 and B39 is to prevent White from invading in the lower right corner.]
;W[pi];B[oi];W[qi];B[pk];W[oh];B[ni];W[rl];B[rm];W[rk];B[qn];W[bg];B[bf];W[mc]C[White can grab the extension of W52 and also should be very happy.]
;B[lp]LB[rf:a]C[B53: Black should make the knight's move at 'a', protecting the corner territory and also threatening White.];W[mq];B[kq];W[kr];B[kp];W[jq];B[mp];W[cg];B[cb];W[db];B[ba]LB[bb:a][ab:b]C[Black hangs with B63 to make life, however Black should connect at 'a', the play in the real game leaves the hidden trouble of White's peep at 'b'.

Through B63, White is a little favorable in territory, and Black is relatively thick, this will be a long game.]
;W[pc];B[pd];W[qc];B[nc];W[rd];B[md];W[re];B[lc];W[jk]LB[or:a][nq:b]C[W72 seems to come from favorable consciousness, White's  knight move at 'a' is worth about 20 points, Black is not easy to enclose territory in the middle, White is easy to play. After W72, B 'b', this is still a close game.

After this move, it is time for lunch break.];B[nq];W[nr]
;B[or]C[The hane of B73 and B75 is very big.];W[kl]LB[ll:a]C[The diagonal of W76 is unexpected, the common move is to make the knight move at 'a', it appears Kim MyungWan's style is very steady.];B[ib];W[hb];B[jb]C[B77 and B79 themselves are very big endgames and also related to thickness and thinness of both sides.];W[jc];B[kc];W[ia];B[ka];W[ab]C[W84 is an asking move, Black is relatively painful.]
;B[ac]C[B85: Black can only tolerate.];W[ee];B[dg];W[bm];B[fj];W[en];B[gl];W[ff]LB[eb:a]C[W92 is to guard against Black's clamp at 'a', it seems White still have some favorable consciousness.];B[go];W[dn];B[gq]C[W94 and B95 are "ideal" moves for both sides, next it leads to the first contact fight of this game, this is also game-deciding place. In this area, there are many variations, both sides are dangerous.]
;W[cr];B[io];W[hn];B[gn];W[np];B[mr];W[lr]LB[gr:a][fp:b][ep:c][fr:d][er:e]C[W102 is questionable, White should play hane at 'a', next B 'b', W 'c', B 'd' and W 'e', making a ko, this way Black is difficult.];B[ns]
;W[hp];B[gp];W[ho]LB[hq:a]C[Now we can see W100 and W102 are bait to guard against Black's sente squeezing move at 'a'.];B[br];W[er];B[do];W[eo];B[ep];W[fp];B[gr];W[bs];B[fo]
;W[hl]C[W116: White should first strengthen one move in the lower left corner to capture Black, then handle the center.];B[es];W[eq]LB[ao:a]C[W118: White again makes mistake, White should hane at 'a'.];B[fs]C[Now Black finds a loophole in the corner, Black takes a better turn, the situation is optimistic for Black. Hu Yaoyu's earlier play is relatively slow, now he starts to exert power in this local area.];W[dr];B[cs];W[ar];B[as];W[ce];B[aq]C[White must have miscalculated, here it forms an exchange which can't be considered as "exchange", White incurs a big loss. Only if Black doesn't make mistake, Black wins the game for sure.]
