Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[In the first game of best-of-5 of the 53rd Japanese Oza Title match, the defending champion Cho U 9p (Black) defeated the challenger Yamashita Keigo 9p by resignation, leading 1:0.];W[dp];B[cd];W[pp];B[qn]
;W[od]C[In the opening, both sides play on their own, showing  a strong attitude.];B[nq];W[oo];B[qq];W[ed];B[ec];W[fc];B[dc];W[fd];B[cf];W[qc];B[kc];W[ic]
;B[ke];W[rd];B[qe];W[pc]LB[re:a]C[The retreat of W22 is the correct move, if White crawls at 'a', then Black will hane at 22, White's direction is wrong.];B[ph]LB[pi:a]C[B23: Black can consider to extend one line wider at 'a', since B1 and B21 are very light and not fear of White's invasion.];W[pm];B[pq];W[qj];B[ie];W[jc]
;B[ld];W[eg];B[oj];W[pk];B[ro];W[pf]LB[ng:a]C[The knight's move of W34 is questionable, White should make the large knight's move at 'a', this is just the vital point!];B[of]C[The attachment of B35 is a good move.];W[oe];B[og];W[pi];B[qh]
;W[oi];B[re]C[Through B41, Black succeeds.];W[mc];B[md];W[mb];B[nc];W[nd]LB[nb:a][kb:b]C[The cut of W46 is really inexplicable. White certainly should turn over at 'a', this way White is left with the crossover at 'b', White's left side would be much thicker.];B[nb];W[la];B[kb]
;W[jb];B[ka];W[ob];B[mg]C[Black blocks crossover in sente then jumps with B53, Black already establishes superiority.];W[fq]LB[mp:a][pn:b]C[The original move of W54 is to make knight's move at 'a', its own value is big and also can guard against Black's push at 'b'.];B[dh];W[co];B[eh];W[gg];B[pn]LB[on:a][om:b]C[The push of B59 is severe! If White blocks at 'a', then Black cuts at 'b', White will sink into a bitter battle.]
;W[mi]C[White tries to play as nimbly as possible and hopes to be able to handle them separately.];B[om];W[lo];B[nl];W[jh];B[li];W[mj];B[lh];W[lj];B[kq];W[mm];B[cl];W[jf]
;B[je];W[fh];B[dj]LB[cq:a][iq:b][bo:c][dq:d]C[B75 is a slow move, Black should first enter the corner at 'a' to probe White. Since there is no two-space extension at 'b', White is very difficult to descend at 'c', only if White blocks at 'd', the Black strengthens with B75, 'b' and 'c' become miai, Black must get one.];W[iq];B[cq];W[bo]C[White resists tenaciously with W78, Black also has no assurance of success.];B[er];W[fr];B[eq]
;W[ep];B[br];W[aq];B[fp];W[gq];B[fo];W[dm];B[ko];W[ho];B[ln];W[lp];B[kp];W[mn]
;B[fm];W[dl];B[hn];W[io];B[hr];W[hq];B[in];W[gn];B[jn];W[gm];B[ml]C[Through W104, Black's loss is heavy and Black can only attach out with B105 to kill White's big group strongly, as to Black who is originally favorable, Black is unnecessary to take this kind of risk.];W[lm];B[ll]
;W[km];B[kl];W[jl];B[jk];W[il];B[mq];W[kk];B[kj];W[lk];B[on];W[lf]LB[mf:a][lg:b]C[The strike of W118 is a good move! If Black attaches at 'a', W 'b' is severe.]
;B[ji]C[Black can only take tenuki to hang with B119, hoping for form an exchange.];W[mf];B[nf];W[ik];B[jj];W[ii];B[kg];W[kf];B[jg];W[if];B[ih];W[nh]LB[ig:a][kh:b][ng:c]C[W130 is the losing move! White should first play atari at 'a', to exchange with B 'b', then strike at 130, this way Black's liberty is tight and also not alive yet, once White cuts at 'c', the stone B53 has to be sacrificed. Besides, if White makes life, Black will lose the game for sure.]
;B[ig];W[hf];B[ri];W[ol];B[ok];W[jr];B[kr];W[pe];B[pl]C[Through B139, Black captures White on the right side and is favorable for the game.];W[no];B[fb];W[gb];B[cm]
;W[dn];B[dk];W[ng]C[Due to the exchange of B131 and W132, the cut of W146 becomes meaningless. White's sequence following W146 perhaps is miscalculation, White clearly incurs loss again. Black finally becomes favorable.];B[ij];W[rg];B[qg];W[rj];B[qi];W[oh];B[pg];W[pj];B[rc];W[rb]
