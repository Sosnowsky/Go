;W[oc];B[md]LB[ed:a]C[B7: For Black to press with the knight's move at 'a' is also a popular opening recently, in the game the one-space high pincer is relatively more fierce.];W[oe];B[pf];W[kd];B[pc];W[ob];B[mf];W[lc]LB[of:a]C[W14: White has the state of mind to press out at 'a', in the game White elects a simple and clear play, which is a strategy to avoid a fight.];B[of]C[After Black seals off here with B15, Black is thick and has nothing to complain.]

;B[ej]C[It seems both sides are roughly acceptable with the sequence from W16 and B29, the play is very simple and clear.];W[dl]LB[jg:a]C[White is in no hurry to play W30, if I were White, I will first make the large knight's move at 'a'.];B[jf]C[B31 is a good point, Black is definitely reluctant to answer on the left side.];W[ql];B[ie]C[Black is very happy to take advantage in sente with B33.];W[ic];B[qj];W[ro];B[qp];W[pn]
;B[mq];W[dj];B[fq];W[dq];B[ip];W[bi];B[cc];W[fo];B[fm]C[Through B47, I think although the game is still very early, but Black is slightly initiative.];W[hq]LB[ek:a]C[The invasion of W48 is unreasonable, at any rate White lacks one move on the left side, to play at 'a' is normal.];B[gp]C[The counterattack of B49 is inevitable.]
;W[hp];B[go];W[ho];B[gn]C[Through B53, White is in a bitter battle.

After this move, it is time for noon break.];W[ek]LB[dn:a]C[W54 is inevitable, White has to strengthen the left side with one more, if White simply strengthens at 'a', Black will extend at 54 in sente, White can't tolerate. In the game, even after reinforcing, the left side is still left with many aji.];B[ci];W[cj];B[dm];W[cm]LB[cn:a]C[B55 and B57 are good order, Black is left with the tactic of hane at 'a' on the left side.]
;B[kq]C[Black steadily attacks with B59, now White is in a very bitter battle.];W[jn];B[el]LB[jm:a][cn:b]C[B61 is a bad move, Black should simply attach at 'a', reserving the tactic of playing hane at 'b'.];W[dn];B[fk];W[dk]C[In the game, through W64, White eliminates the hidden trouble on the left side, the battle line has been extended.];B[jm]C[B65 is a good move for attacking.];W[kn];B[im]
;W[jp];B[ll]C[Through B69, Black forms some influence in the center.];W[rj];B[ri];W[rk];B[pi];W[rp];B[rq]C[With the sequence from W70 to B75, White settles the left side in sente.];W[fj]LB[jq:a][gi:b][no:c]C[White turns back to capture two stones with W76, it is a desperate fighting attitude, if White reinforces at 'a', then Black will form a big territory in the center by playing at 'b', White's territory will be inadequate, but before playing W76, White should play at 'a' first to exchange one move with Black then come back and capture two stone, this would be more steady.]
;B[jq]C[The attack of B77 is also inevitable, White takes tenuki here, if Black can't do something to these two white groups, Black definitely is no good.];W[gq];B[fp];W[kp];B[gi];W[gk];B[fl];W[fi];B[gj];W[hn];B[hm];W[ig];B[ii]C[Black encloses territory with the sequence from B81 to B89 and also prepares for attacking at the bottom.]
;W[jg]C[After W90, Black sinks into deep thinking, if Black doesn't come up with some good play at the bottom, White would be slightly better in territory.];B[kf]C[B91: Black elects not to strike White's two groups at the bottom.];W[rr];B[qr];W[sq];B[qq];W[er]C[White strengthens to make life with W96 and also serves as endgame play, White's advantage is clear.];B[hc];W[id];B[hf];W[hg];B[hd]
;W[gf]LB[qb:a]C[W102 is a careless move, White should simply jump to 'a'.];B[kb];W[kc];B[ib];W[jb];B[ja];W[jc];B[gb];W[lb];B[db];W[eb];B[cb]C[In the game, with the sequence from B103 to B113, White clearly incurs loss.]
;W[qb];B[kh]C[Through B115, the situation again becomes unclear.];W[nk]C[White charges ahead with W116, which is inevitable, if Black gets to enclose territory, White's territory will be certainly inadequate.];B[ol]C[Black counterattacks with B117, it is a game-deciding move.];W[fc];B[he];W[mm];B[lm];W[ok]C[W122: White must have ignored that Black can strongly kill White on the left side.];B[mn];W[nm]
