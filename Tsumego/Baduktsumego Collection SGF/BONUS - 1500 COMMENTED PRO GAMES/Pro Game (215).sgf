;W[qq];B[kq]LB[rq:a]C[B7: Black aims to seek variations, playing hane at 'a' is rather common.];W[rp];B[qo];W[ro];B[pq];W[pp];B[qn];W[qr];B[pj]C[Through B15, the variation is also one joseki.];W[fq]
;B[fp]LB[hq:a][cq:b]C[B17: If Black plays pincer at 'a', then White will enter the corner at 'b', the variation would be relatively dull.];W[gp];B[eq];W[fo];B[ep];W[go];B[dn]LB[gq:a][gr:b]TR[kq][fo][go][gp][fq]C[B23: Black didn't play atari at 'a' in order to reserve the tactic of playing at 'b'. So far, the position of the marked stone is just right, however the triangle marked four white stones is still not completely stable, this clearly fits Cho Hunhyun's taste.]
;W[nc];B[qf];W[pb];B[mc]C[B27: White is also unwilling to play insipid moves.];W[md];B[lc];W[ld];B[nb];W[oc];B[jc];W[kd];B[ic];W[qc]
;B[fc];W[cf];B[qd];W[ob]C[Through W40, both sides are roughly acceptable.];B[ne]C[B41: Black wants to take advantage in sente.];W[lg]LB[nd:a]C[W42: White is unwilling to fall behind, because Black's cut at 'a' is gote, so White is in no hurry to strengthen.];B[ck]C[B43 is a mutual good point, from territory's point of view, Black is favorable.];W[ko]C[W44: White seeks to gain profit by attacking.];B[np]C[B45 is a common attack tactic.]
;W[no];B[mp]LB[mo:a][nq:b][oq:c]C[B47: If Black plays hane at 'a', then W47, B 'b' and W 'c', Black doesn't have assurance of success.];W[mo];B[oq];W[oo];B[nr];W[pr];B[iq];W[jp];B[jq]
;W[hq];B[ip];W[io];B[hn];W[ho];B[pl]LB[ql:a]C[B61: Although reinforcing at 'a' is more solid, but the pressure on the center would be different.];W[or];B[nq];W[qm]LB[rn:a]C[W64 prevents Black from turning at 'a', its value is not small.];B[pm]
;W[rn];B[ql];W[rm]C[After W68, Black's aji at the bottom is not good.];B[jn];W[jo];B[ln]C[Before strengthening, Black takes advantage in sente with B69 and B71.];W[lo];B[ir]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.];W[ci]C[The two-space extension of W74 is White's long-waited big point.];B[dg]C[B75 is an asking move.];W[ec]
;B[fd];W[df]C[W78 is strong and unyielding.];B[kg]C[B79: Black first invokes a fight, the center was originally thought to be White's territory, surprisingly Black wants to achieve something here.];W[kh];B[lf];W[mf]C[W80 and W82 are the most strong and unyielding answer.];B[kf];W[me];B[lh];W[mg];B[li];W[jh]
;B[if]C[Through B89, it forms a chaotic fight.];W[of]LB[nd:a]C[W90: White prevents Black to cut at 'a' and also aims to pound at Black's thinness on the right side.];B[di];W[pi]C[B91 and W92: Both sides play on their own, aiming to obtain the initiative.];B[qi];W[qh];B[ph];W[pg];B[rh];W[oh];B[rj]C[The sequence from B93 to B99 is the steadiest answer, White's profit is small.]
;W[dj];B[cj];W[bh];B[ei];W[jj];B[cc]C[B105 entering the corner is a surprising move.];W[eb];B[cd];W[ce];B[ee];W[de];B[fb];W[ea]LB[ff:a]C[Through W112, in terms of points, it seems Black incurs a loss, but Black has prevented White from sticking the head out at 'a', Black also has some profit.]
;B[jl]LB[lk:a][pn:b]C[B113 is fierce and relentless, jumping to 'a' is normal, the play in the game aims to connect at 'b' to attack White as a whole.];W[kk];B[ll]LB[mj:a][pn:b]C[The play of B115 is undisguised, if White captures the two black stones by the knight's move at 'a', then Black will connect at 'b' to kill White's big dragon.];W[mj];B[pn];W[in];B[hl];W[hm]
;B[gm];W[im];B[jk]LB[il:a][kl:b][jm:c][lm:d][gl:e]C[B123 is a good move, if Black connects at 'a', then White will push at 'b', B 'c' and W 'd', White would be still left with the cut at 'e', Black has many defects.];W[gl]C[W124: White has to conduct an exchange.];B[hk];W[fl];B[kj];W[fj]
;B[hi];W[lk];B[ji]C[Through B131, Black clearly gains.];W[dl];B[cl];W[ef];B[dm]C[B135 is good sequence.];W[em];B[en];W[fn];B[ej];W[fr]
;B[er];W[es];B[ds];W[fs];B[dr];W[bj];B[bk];W[hr]C[The sequence from W140 to W148 is White's privilege.];B[lr];W[lp];B[lq];W[ij]C[W152 is the remaining tactic very early on.]
;B[lj];W[ii];B[mk];W[ig];B[hf];W[hh];B[gi];W[hg];B[aj];W[fg]C[W162 is the original move, if being separated by Black, White needs to capture Black's two stones in the upper left corner by reducing liberties.];B[mb]C[The value of B163 is very big, Black's advantage becomes clear.];W[nk]
;B[ml];W[oj]C[W164 and W166 are also big endgames.];B[ni];W[pk];B[qj];W[mi];B[mh];W[nj];B[nh];W[oi];B[ng];W[nf];B[rd]
