;W[oc]C[W4 and W6: White aims to ruin Black's plan.];B[dp];W[pf]C[W8: White leads the game to complicated large avalanche variation, Lee Changho's fighting spirit is high.];B[od];W[pd];B[pe];W[pc];B[oe]C[For Black to connect at top with B13 is simple.];W[qe]C[But White gains a big profit and has nothing to complain.];B[qf];W[re]
;B[pg];W[md];B[of];W[rd]LB[cc:a]C[Next if Black directly enters the corner at 'a', White will form a good shape at top, White can be satisfied.];B[kc]C[B21: Therefore, Black destroys White's intention.];W[lc]C[However, for Black to fight inside White's influence is a little far-fetched.];B[fe];W[cg]LB[db:a]C[The big knight's move of W24 is good move, making Black reluctant to play at 'a'.];B[kd]LB[dc:a]C[And also White will be more satisfied to descend at 'a' next.]
;W[dc]LB[he:a]C[W26: Perhaps White should directly jump out at 'a', however the play in the game is Lee's style.];B[eg]LB[he:a]TR[hc]C[Even play like this, the play of B27 is still over zealous. Now Black certainly can only seal off W4 (the marked stone). This way White is not easy to stick head out on the right side, Black should have nothing to complain.];W[he];B[ch]LB[hg:a]C[The attachment of B29 is again overplay. Black still should cap at 'a', watch how White to continue.];W[dh]C[White counterattacks with W30, the game enters into White's tempo very early on.];B[dg];W[ci]
;B[cf]LB[bh:a]C[B33: If Black descends at 'a', White will retreat at 33, Black is not easy to handle.];W[bh];B[bg];W[ch];B[de];W[fb]C[The sequence from B31 to W38 seems inevitable.];B[gd]C[Following B39, Black pushes and separates White.];W[gb];B[hd];W[id];B[ic]
;W[je]C[But White hangs with W44, here White is not fearful of fight. Looking back, White takes one stone first on the left side, Black incurs loss first.];B[ld];W[ib]C[The atari of W46 makes Black painful.];B[jc];W[me]TR[lc]C[W48: White extends out and prepares to sacrifice W22 (the marked stone), which is good strategy.];B[lf];W[mf];B[kf];W[mh]LB[ig:a][pi:b]C[After White jumps out with W52, White is left with two good points at 'a' and 'b', White completely takes control of the game.]
;B[oh]LB[ig:a]C[B53: Black can only capture three stones at 'a', which is imperative.];W[ig]C[Black needs to handle both sides and sinks into a difficult situation.];B[kh];W[ii];B[eh];W[ki]LB[li:a]C[W58: White seeks simplicity. However if White makes diagonal at 'a', Black is more difficult to handle.];B[jh];W[ji];B[ih]
;W[hh];B[hi]LB[hg:a]C[B63: Black loses common sense, Black certainly should cut at 'a' instead.];W[gi];B[hj];W[gg]C[White plays atari out with W64 and W66.];B[jf];W[if];B[li];W[jk];B[lh];W[ed]
;B[ee];W[gj];B[hk];W[ej]C[Through W76, White seals off Black's big dragon, Black is already showing losing trend.];B[cd];W[cc];B[bc];W[bd];B[be];W[ce];B[gc];W[hb];B[cd]
;W[lj];B[mi];W[ce];B[ec];W[eb];B[cd]C[Black manages to ko-live, ...];W[lb]C[..., but White obtains sente and retreat with W92.];B[dl];W[el];B[em];W[fl];B[ck]
;W[ei];B[ad];W[mj];B[oj];W[fm]C[White again obtains the vital points with W100 and W102, White's advantage is obvious.];B[po];W[kp]C[Afterwards, White proceeds safely and wins the game at the end.];B[kn];W[in];B[jl];W[il];B[kk]
