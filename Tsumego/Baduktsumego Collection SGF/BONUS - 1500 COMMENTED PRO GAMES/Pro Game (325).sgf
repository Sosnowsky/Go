Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[pd]C[In the game 3 of 41st Wangwi title match held on 6/20, Lee Changho lost to Yun Junsang 6p by 3.5 points, trailing the best-of-5 series by 1:2.];W[dd];B[qp];W[dq];B[nq]C[Recently Lee Changho often uses the opening of B1, B3 and B5.]
;W[qj];B[ql];W[qf];B[mc];W[rd];B[qh];W[of]LB[pi:a]C[Generally, when Black makes big knight of B9, with B13 Black will play at 'a'.];B[qc]C[B13 is novel and Lee Changho's unique play.];W[pi];B[do];W[co]
;B[dp];W[cp];B[eq];W[cn];B[dr];W[cq];B[fp]C[With the joseki from B15 to B23, Lee Changho puts more emphasis on bottom.];W[ol]C[W24 is good point, if Black takes this point, Black's moyo at bottom would be more significant.];B[qn];W[kc];B[rc];W[fc]
;B[em];W[dl]LB[ch:a]C[B29 is kind of "high hand" style, but it seems after exchanging with W30 Black loses the chance to split the left side, for Black to split at 'a' is common.];B[qg]C[The sequence following B31 is "command style" play, White has no room to elect other variations.];W[pe];B[og];W[od];B[oc];W[nd];B[nc];W[oh];B[ng]
;W[pg];B[ph];W[pf];B[qi];W[nh];B[pj];W[oi];B[rj];W[mg];B[md];W[me];B[le];W[qd]
;B[mf]C[Through B53, Black obtains a lot of territory, but White captures two stones and becomes very thick, the variation is not necessarily to Black's advantage. Black is better off to preserve this variation.];W[nf];B[be];W[ce];B[bd];W[bf];B[cc];W[cg];B[eb];W[jq]LB[fb:a]C[W62: White takes tenuki and is alert, W 'a' is big but the bottom is very open and more urgent.];B[el]
;W[dk];B[lq];W[jo];B[hq]LB[fr:a][jm:b]C[B67 is questionable, since W 'a' is tesuji, the value of B67 is very small. Black should cap at 'b' and force White to make life locally, at the same time Black can reinforce the lower right corner, this is the right strategy.];W[qq]C[After W68, White is left with ko-living, Black is not comfortable.];B[pp];W[jm];B[ne];W[pc];B[pb]
;W[pq];B[oq];W[fr];B[gr];W[fj];B[ec]LB[fb:a]C[B79: Black wants to play at 'a'.];W[ed];B[lg];W[fb]LB[fd:a]C[After W82, once White has stone at around 'a', Black's corner is not alive.];B[mh]
;W[oj];B[pk];W[rg];B[rh];W[mi];B[ng];W[or]LB[rp:a][rr:b][rq:c][os:d]C[W90 is the only way to find a loophole, if W 'a', then B 'b', W 'c' and B 'd', White will die unconditionally.];B[nr];W[qr]
;B[sp]C[B93 is tesuji, except this move, all others will lead to tight-liberty ko.];W[rq];B[rs];W[ns];B[ms];W[ps];B[os];W[je];B[lm]C[B101: If Black eliminates the ko simply, Black's situation is not good, so Black attacks White first in center and strongly holds the ko fight in the lower right corner.];W[gl];B[hm];W[ho]
;B[gm];W[gp];B[gq]C[W106 is clever move to exchange with B107, White has nothing to lose.];W[jk];B[jg]C[B109 is must-obtain point.];W[fo];B[dn];W[fn];B[fm];W[dm];B[en];W[er]
;B[fq];W[in];B[kn];W[jp];B[ir];W[cr]LB[lk:a]C[W122 itself is worth 11 points and also related to ko threats and thickness/thinness, its value is huge! However, White is also very dangerous, the center is very thin, for White to reinforce at 'a' is the original move.];B[hg]LB[lj:a]C[B123: Black loses a good chance. If Black attacks at 'a', Black can fight adequately.];W[if];B[ig];W[lk]C[After White strengthens with W126, Black's situation is difficult.]
;B[ic]C[B127: If Black eliminates the ko in the lower right corner, the situation will be close and slightly to White's advantage. In the game, Lee Changho elects to fight desperately.];W[gf];B[kd];W[ns];B[im];W[jn];B[os];W[jd];B[jc];W[ns];B[hk];W[ij]C[White is favorable in ko threats, Black is difficult to handle.]

;W[ke];B[ld];W[ns];B[nl];W[ml];B[os];W[sh];B[qk];W[ns];B[nm]C[B161: Black wants to call off his troops.];W[mr]C[W162 is relentless move, White pushes on in the flush of victory, now White can use the ko threats in the upper left corner.];B[os]
;W[dc];B[db];W[ns];B[nj];W[mk];B[os];W[bb];B[cb];W[ns];B[fe]C[B173 is damaging ko threat but it can make many more ko threats. If Black plays other ko threats, White 173 is ko threat too, Black is also not good.];W[gg];B[gh];W[hd]
;B[os];W[hi]C[When W178, Black already can't answer.];B[df];W[cf];B[ns];W[hh]C[W182: It forms an exchange, White's small victory already can't be changed.];B[gj];W[gi];B[fk];W[ej];B[ja];W[mm]
