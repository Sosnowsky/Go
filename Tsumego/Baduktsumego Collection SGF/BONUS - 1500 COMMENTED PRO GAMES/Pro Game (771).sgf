Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[pd]C[In the game 3 of Chunwon Title match, Lee Sedol clearly didn't give a play to his talent and didn't get any winning chance for the whole game.];W[dp]C[Jo HanSeung won his first title of his Go career.];B[qp];W[dc];B[fq]
;W[cn];B[kq]C[The opening up to B7 is popular nowadays.];W[qj];B[pk]LB[qh:a]C[B9: In China, most players like to play at 'a'. B9 in the game is commonly used by Korean players.];W[qk];B[pl];W[ql];B[qm];W[qg];B[rm];W[hp]LB[nc:a][oq:b]C[W16: Not sure whether White has studied it or not. The common move is for White to play at 'a'. After obtaining sente, then White invades at 'b'. If Black forms a big territory at bottom, White definitely is not good.]
;B[fo];W[hn];B[ko]C[B19 is the vital point. If White takes this point, Black's moyo at bottom will be reduced a lot.];W[fm];B[hr];W[dq]LB[km:a]C[W22 is very big locally, but it has no big impact on Black's moyo and looks slow, to directly play at 'a' is common.];B[io];W[qq];B[pq];W[pr];B[qr]
;W[rq];B[rr];W[km];B[jm]TR[io]C[Due to addition of B23 (the marked stone), Black's counterattack of B31 is severe. White sinks into a difficult fight very early on.];W[pp];B[oq];W[rp];B[op];W[qo];B[oo];W[pm];B[pn]
;W[om];B[qn];W[kl];B[im];W[nc]LB[nl:a]C[W44 is overplay! Lee Sedol perhaps feels his situation is not good, so he is reluctant to strengthen at 'a'.];B[nl]C[But B45 is too severe!];W[nm]C[Generally speaking, the worse the situation is, the steadier you should play. Otherwise you will lose even faster.];B[nk];W[mm];B[oh]C[B49 is good move!]
;W[pf];B[kj]C[W50 and B51 are miai vital points.];W[jl]C[W52: White can only turn head very painfully in the game!];B[nd]C[B53 is good tempo.];W[nf];B[oc]C[After B55, W44 becomes a waste move.];W[ki]C[W56 is Lee Sedol's top-rated common tactic.];B[li];W[jj];B[lh];W[lj]
;B[mj];W[kk];B[kh]C[As to this, Jo HanSeung responds calmly and fixes shape by sacrificing. Now we can see the efficiency of W52 is very low.];W[jh];B[jg];W[ig];B[ih];W[ji];B[kf];W[jf];B[kg];W[if];B[kd]
;W[qd]C[W74 is necessary to avoid being exploited by Black.];B[qc];W[qe];B[rd];W[re];B[id]C[But after Black grabs B79, Black is very happy.];W[gp]LB[df:a]C[W80 is wrong direction. Now if White wants to overturn the game, White can only bet on left-side moyo. Therefore, even if W80 is very big itself, it is a slow move for the whole game. White should play at 'a' to expand left-side moyo.];B[ce]C[B81 breaks away White's moyo, Black's advantage becomes obvious.];W[me];B[ld]
;W[je]C[The play of W82 and W84 is difficult to understand.];B[jd];W[cg];B[ed];W[ec];B[fd];W[fc];B[eg]C[B91 is excellent point!];W[gd];B[ge]C[Black's shape is smooth.];W[he];B[gc]
;W[hd];B[hc];W[gf];B[ff];W[cd];B[gg]C[B101: Black forms a good shape and can settle easily. The aji at top is bad, but there is no big deal.];W[fe];B[ee]C[So far, the game is basically over.];W[hh];B[gh]C[Afterwards there are still lot of moves, but they already have nothing to do with the outcome of this game.];W[hg];B[ge]C[At the end, Black is leading about 15 points on the board.]
