(;SZ[19]EV[Korea 35th Paewang final game 4]DT[2001-03-09]PC[Korea]BR[9p]WR[9p]KM[6.5]PW[Lee Changho]PB[Cho Hunhyun]RE[W+R]C[Copyright by gogameworld.com and weiqi.tom.com.];B[pd]C[This is game 4. In the first three games, Cho Hunhyun is trailing 1:2.];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[fq]
;W[hq];B[qo];W[fp];B[cj]C[The opening up to B9 is same as the recent game between Cho Hunhyun and Rui Naiwei in Guksu tournament.];W[eq]LB[gq:a]C[W10: Lee Changho starts to vary. In that game, Rui Naiwei played at 'a', the result is not ideal.];B[cm];W[nc];B[fc]C[B13: Black takes tenuki and approaches another corner instead, showing Cho Hunhyun's fighting spirit.];W[cf];B[db];W[cc]
;B[ic];W[qc]LB[qf:a]C[W18 is Lee Changho's style, to double-approach at 'a' is also playable, but the variation will be complicated.];B[pc];W[qd];B[pe];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[oc];W[qf];B[nd]LB[qh:a]C[B27: Black first strengthens himself and waits chance to play at 'a'.]
;W[nq]C[W28: White makes extension at maximum limit, since White in the lower left corner is very solid and not fearful of invasion.];B[no];W[lp];B[qh]C[B29 and B31 are also related thought in the opening.];W[qg]LB[re:a]C[W32: White guards against Black's strike at 'a' in sente.];B[ph]C[B33: Black can also be satisfied.];W[mn]C[W34 is the vital point for both sides' moyo and influence.];B[nl]LB[nn:a]C[B35: Black sticks head out first, to play at 'a' appears slow. The defect of B35 is that Black's shape looks thin.]
;W[je]C[W36: White wants to reduce Black's influence in sente.];B[ed]LB[hd:a][hc:b][fd:c][kd:d]C[B37 is strong and guards against White's tactic of W 'a', B 'b' and W 'c'. For Black to play at 'd' just fits White's intention.];W[ee]LB[de:a]C[W38: White is reluctant to be haned at 'a' by Black.];B[fe];W[ef];B[jg]C[B41 is severe, White is restricted to stick head out.]
;W[gd];B[fd];W[if];B[ff];W[ig];B[jh];W[ih];B[ji]C[Through B49, Black can be satisfied.];W[hj];B[gh];W[ii];B[ik]LB[jk:a]C[B53 is relentless, to jump at 'a' is steady.]
;W[jj]C[The counterattack of W54 is inevitable.];B[ij];W[gi];B[kl];W[op]C[W58: White pounds on Black's thinness.];B[nn]LB[pn:a][om:b]C[B59: If Black makes diagonal at 'a', White can pierce through at 'b'.];W[pp];B[qp];W[qq];B[qr]
;W[rq];B[or];W[on];B[pn]LB[pm:a]C[B67 is relentless, to make knight at 'a' is relatively safe.];W[om];B[nm]LB[oo:a][po:b]C[B69: If Black pushes at 'a', then White can cut at 'b', Black is not good.];W[qn]LB[oo:a][pl:b][rn:c]C[W70 is very good order. If White directly plays at 'a', then Black can seal off at 'b', if White plays W70 now, Black can play atari at 'c', White is not good.]
;B[qm];W[oo];B[rn]C[B73: Black can only play this way.];W[nr];B[rr];W[jc]C[W76 is very big, destroying territory and also taking chance to reduce Black's influence in the center.];B[id]C[B77: Black aims to take sente.];W[jd];B[ip];W[iq];B[jp]C[B79 and B81: Black is very happy to play these two sente moves.]
;W[kr];B[bp]LB[cq:a]C[B83 is the last big point. White already has no mindset to answer at 'a', so far Black's situation is a little better.];W[lg]C[W84: Before Black settles down, White takes chance to fight desperately for victory.];B[mc]C[B85: Black first protects one side.];W[me]LB[kj:a]C[W86 is good move, aiming to capture three stones at 'a'.];B[ng];W[og];B[of];W[nh]
;B[mg];W[mh];B[lf];W[kf];B[mf];W[le];B[nf]LB[kj:a]C[B87: Both sides are fighting strongly around the extension at 'a'. Black wants to obtain sente and also not allow White to connect with the upper right corner. So the shape appears a little ugly.];W[jl]LB[kj:a][jm:b]C[W98 is good move to probe Black. If White first extends at 'a', then play W98, Black may play hane at 'b'.];B[gp]C[The timing of B99 is excellent.]
;W[fo]LB[gq:a]TR[ij][ik]C[W100: White has no choice, if White cuts at 'a', B100 already becomes sente, White couldn't capture Black's two marked stones in ladder later on.];B[il]C[B101: Black waits to see how White to act, here both sides have tried their best, it is fun to watch.];W[kj];B[lh];W[kg];B[li];W[ll]C[W106 is sharp tesuji and Black can't look after both sides.];B[jm]TR[jg][jh][ji][li][lh]C[B107: Black prepares to sacrifice five marked stones.]
;W[mj];B[gq]TR[jg][jh][ji][lh][li]C[B109 is Black's compensation for his five-stone loss.];W[km];B[jk];W[lj]C[W112: White captures cleanly, the fight in the lower left corner will decide the game.];B[cq];W[er];B[kq]C[B115 is good move.]
;W[lq];B[jr];W[jq];B[hr];W[ir];B[hp];W[kp]C[Through W122, Black crosses over in sente.];B[fm]C[The counterattack of B123 is inevitable.];W[bo];B[bn];W[cp];B[bq]
;W[em];B[en];W[fn];B[fl]LB[el:a][gm:b][hn:c][jn:d][gl:e]C[B129 and B131 is the most relentless killing move. If B131 at 'a', then W 'b', B131 and W 'c', next 'd' and 'e' becomes miai, White must get one. ];W[co];B[ao];W[dm];B[dn]
;W[cn];B[bl]LB[cl:a][dq:b]C[If B137 at 'a', then W 'b' becomes sente, Black is not good.];W[dl];B[dk];W[eo];B[cl];W[do];B[dq]C[The sequence from W138 to B143 is inevitable. So far Black's territory is not enough and has only one choice: kill White.];W[ek];B[ej]
;W[hn]LB[in:a][hl:b]C[W144 and W146: White's calculation is accurate and White achieves safety. Next if B 'a', then W 'b', Black is not good. Black can only concede the game. 

Therefore, Lee Changho wins Paewang title by 3:1.])
