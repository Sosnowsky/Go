;W[pl]C[The one-space high pincer of W6 is Cho U's favorite play.];B[om]C[The small knight's move of B7 is fresh, Takao Shinji is also well prepared for the one-space high approach.];W[nq];B[pi];W[ol]C[The press following W10 is called "push from behind", White's courage is worth praising.];B[nm];W[nl];B[mm];W[ml];B[lm];W[ll];B[km]
;W[kl];B[jm];W[jl]LB[ik:a]C[Especially White continues to press with W20, it is really unexpected. Normally White will make the knight's move at 'a'.];B[il];W[im];B[lq];W[rp];B[nr];W[or];B[io]LB[ik:a][in:b][hm:c]C[The small knight's move of B27 is interesting, if Black extends at 'a', White will extend at 'b', Black is difficult to form a good shape. After B27, if W 'c', then B 'a', Black will no longer has the above problem.

;W[ik]C[W28: White sees through Black's mind.];B[hl];W[hk];B[hm]C[Through B31, it forms a very unique pattern, the gain and loss is not clear.

After this move, it is time for lunch break.];W[ec];B[oc];W[eq];B[ic];W[df];B[ed];W[dd];B[de]
;W[dc];B[ce];W[ee];B[fd];W[cc];B[be]LB[cf:a][ef:b][ch:c][gb:d][hd:e][eh:f]C[B45 is also one of josekis, if Black crawls at 'a', next W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 'e' and W 'f', in this joseki White's overall configuration is vivid. This is also the ideal picture when Cho U elects to play the big slant with W36.];W[bc]

;W[hf];B[gh];W[hd];B[ie]LB[hc:a][gc:b][dh:c][cg:d][gi:e]C[B63: Black alertly elects to sacrifice, if Black plays atari at 'a', then W63, B 'b', Black can connect back three stones, however W 'c', B 'd' and the double hane of W 'e' is severe, Black's loss outweighs his gain.];W[if];B[jf];W[gc];B[fi]
;W[id];B[je];W[jd];B[kd]C[After Black sacrifices three stones, up to B71, it forms an exchange, Black can be acceptable.];W[pg]C[The invasion of W72 is inevitable, only playing like this, White may have a chance to win.];B[ni];W[oe];B[jj];W[jk];B[qe]LB[nd:a][re:b]C[With the sequence following B77, Black misjudges overall game's thinness and thickness, Black fails in the attack, this is Black's losing cause in the game. With B77 Black should make the diagonal at 'a' to ensure his connection. As to this shape, with B77 Black also should make the diagonal at 'b'.]
;W[lf];B[le];W[me];B[jg];W[nc]C[After this move, the game was closed for the first day.];B[nb];W[mc];B[kc];W[ob]C[The cut of W86 is a good move!];B[pb];W[pc];B[oa]
;W[od];B[qc]LB[ob:a]C[Since the position of B77 is not right, with B91 Black couldn't connect at 'a', Black is very painful.];W[ng];B[pf]LB[li:a]C[B93: Black makes mistake again! Black should jump to 'a', White's long dragon is also burdensome.];W[mi]C[The attachment of W94 is intense! Black instead has the problem to connect.];B[mj];W[li];B[lj];W[kh]

;W[qk];B[pj]C[Through B113, after Black finally manages to connect back, White also gets to connect, Black fails in the attack!];W[rj];B[cn]C[The good news is Black grabs the last big point with B115, the game is still not over.];W[ci];B[ck]LB[dh:a]C[B117 is questionable, Black should retreat at 'a', this way White can't borrow too much strength for other purposes.];W[dk];B[cl];W[dh];B[cg];W[fj]LB[di:a]C[After White attaches with W122, since White's connection at 'a' is sente, Black already doesn't have any good tactic to attack.]
;B[mg];W[lh];B[gj]C[With the sequence following B125, Black has no choice but try to kill strongly. If Black retreats a little, Black will lose the game for sure.];W[ei];B[eh];W[dg];B[bi];W[fh];B[ig];W[fc];B[eh];W[bh];B[cj]
