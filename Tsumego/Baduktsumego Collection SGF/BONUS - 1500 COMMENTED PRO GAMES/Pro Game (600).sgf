Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[pd]C[So far, in this final, Chen Yaoye seems not to in his state! Overall, he clearly didn't play his normal level. Comparatively, Gu Li played very brilliantly.];W[dd];B[qp];W[dp];B[fq]
;W[cn];B[oq]C[The play of B7 is rarely seen, perhaps this was specially prepared by Gu Li.];W[qj];B[fc];W[cf];B[qh];W[qm];B[db];W[gc]LB[nc:a]C[The play of W14 is normally seen when the right side is under the influence of his own stones, the play in the real game is relatively far-fetched.

White can consider to play at 'a' to do some preparation.];B[gd];W[hc]
;B[fb]C[B15 and B17 are correct.];W[cc];B[hd];W[ic];B[id];W[jc];B[mc]LB[ed:a]C[Especially B23 is the key move, if Black first plays at 'a', White will play at 23 instead.];W[jd];B[ed];W[jf];B[qd]LB[gg:a][hg:b]C[The territory value of B27 is huge, but the premise of this move is that Black must have the tactic of breaking White's seal off at 'a', otherwise Black should stick the head out at 'b'.]
;W[gg];B[gf]LB[de:a][ce:b][dc:c]C[B29 is crude, Black should play at 'a', next W 'b' and B 'c', this way there are no variations.];W[ff];B[de];W[ce];B[dc];W[fe];B[cd];W[bd];B[fd]
;W[hf]C[In the real game, Chen Yaoye seals off alertly with W34 and W38, Black is constricted.];B[df];W[dg];B[cb];W[dd]LB[ch:a]C[W42 is an impulsive move! At this situation White should hang at 'a', this is a good move! This way White's moyo at the bottom is magnificent, White can fight.];B[dr];W[cd]LB[cq:a]C[Due to the existence of W42, White simply goes to the end and takes the corner first, but comparing with the outside big point, W44 is still small, White should play at 'a'.];B[cq];W[fn]LB[cm:a][dl:b]C[W46 is the losing move! After Black attaches at 'a', White has no follow-up tactic, White's thinking is very questionable. With W46 White should play at 'b', the outcome of the game is still early.]
;B[cm];W[dm];B[cl];W[bn];B[dl];W[fl];B[ci];W[bk]C[W54: White makes a capturing posture.];B[bm];W[em];B[bh]C[But with B55 and B57 Black handles very cleverly, White has no answer.];W[bb]
;B[gb];W[an]C[The descent of W60 is really surprising! This is not like attack! It is just an endgame move. Chen Yaoye's play here is really irregular.];B[bj];W[hq];B[lq];W[ck];B[dk];W[am];B[al];W[bl];B[cj];W[ak];B[aj]
;W[al];B[ej]LB[dh:a]C[B73: If Black makes diagonal at 'a', Black already makes life cleanly, this way Black is simply favorable. Of course, Black will not die either in the real game.];W[dh];B[gj];W[di];B[dj];W[fk];B[fj];W[ij];B[hi];W[ig];B[jh]
;W[oc];B[nd];W[qb];B[rc]LB[od:a]C[B87: For Black to connect at 'a' is better.];W[nb];B[mb];W[od]C[W90: White makes playing thread.];B[oe];W[ne];B[me];W[nf]
;B[mf];W[ng];B[mg];W[nh];B[mh];W[pe];B[of];W[pg];B[pf];W[qf];B[qe];W[qg]C[Through W106, White gains some profit.];B[rb]
;W[ki]LB[ee:a][mi:b]C[The play of W108 is completely inexplicable. B 'a' is sente, here White shouldn't play, for White to play at 'b' is better.];B[ji];W[jj];B[ee];W[bg];B[hh];W[ld];B[md];W[kh];B[kg];W[jg]
;B[kj];W[kf];B[kk];W[lg];B[hk]C[When Black captures two white stones with B123, White again incurs loss in this fight, White's situation is very bad, it is reasonable for White to concede defeat right now. Afterwards, although there are still many moves, it is meaningless.];W[mi];B[mj];W[li];B[gp];W[ma];B[la];W[oa];B[na]
