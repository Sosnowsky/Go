;B[mc];W[qc];B[rc];W[pc];B[re];W[ne]C[Through 12, the position was once considered as joseki, but it is rarely seen nowadays.];B[me]LB[pg:a]C[B13: Black seeks variation, making the large knight's move at 'a' is usual.];W[mf];B[le];W[qf];B[nf]C[With the sequence after B17, Black is very brave to fight by sacrifice.]
;W[of];B[ng];W[oh];B[pe];W[oe];B[lg];W[og];B[rg]C[B25 is a good move.];W[rf];B[qg];W[pf];B[qj];W[sf]
;B[qm]C[As for the result up to 31, Black can fight.];W[qo];B[cn];W[fq];B[dj];W[eh];B[ch];W[ej];B[ek];W[fj];B[fk];W[gj];B[gk]
;W[hj];B[il];W[gf];B[fg]LB[cg:a]C[B47 is fierce and ruthless, it also indirectly prevents White from attaching at 'a'.];W[gg];B[fh];W[gh];B[eg];W[mq];B[qb];W[sb]LB[pb:a][qa:b][ra:c]C[W54: White seeks to kill all, if White turns at 'a', then B 54, W 'b' and B 'c', it would lead to a ko-living, White can not be satisfied.]
;B[rb];W[pb];B[qa];W[sa];B[se];W[qe];B[rd];W[sc];B[nb];W[pa]C[Through 64, it forms a bent four in the corner, but White on the outside is still not completely alive, Black can make a lot of utilization.];B[oj]C[The attack after B65 is very tight.];W[mi]
;B[mg];W[nj];B[oi];W[nh];B[ki];W[nk]C[W72: White has to stick his head out, otherwise after being sealed in, Black in the upper right corner is ko-alive, White's big dragon would be dangerous.];B[jj];W[jh];B[kh];W[jl]LB[ni:a][mh:b][mj:c]C[W76: In sente, White wants to prevent Black's tactic of B 'a', W 'b' and the cut of B 'c'.]
;B[he]LB[ik:a][hd:b]C[B77: Black tenukis to start attacking, it is a good move, White sinks into a difficult situation, if Black retreats to 'a', then W 'b', Black can no longer kill White.];W[di];B[ci];W[dk];B[cj];W[hk]C[With the sequence after W82, White has already exhausted his whole bag of tricks.];B[hl];W[gl];B[gm];W[ik]
;B[jk];W[fl];B[el];W[fm];B[jm]LB[im:a]C[B91 is the first dubious move, the turn at 'a' would be better.];W[kl];B[dl];W[fn];B[in]LB[km:a][ll:b]C[B95 is the last losing move, Black certainly should extend at 'a', after White extends at 'b', then hang at 95, White would have no chance of winning.]
;W[km];B[kn];W[ln];B[ko];W[lo];B[kq];W[io]C[W102 delivers Black the fatal blow.];B[hn];W[ho];B[gn];W[go];B[kp];W[jr]C[W108 is a good move. After this move, it is time for lunch break.]
;B[mr]LB[kr:a][lq:b][ge:c][jq:d]C[If B109 at 'a', then after W 'b', B 'c' and W 'd', White clearly has more liberties in the capturing race.];W[mp]C[W110 is a calm move, Black has no good follow-up maneuvers.];B[kr];W[nr];B[ir];W[jq];B[fo];W[eo];B[ip]
;W[jo];B[jp];W[jn]C[After W120, the game has been turned around.];B[ok];W[nl];B[ge];W[lr];B[gq];W[fp])
