;W[cf];B[db];W[qf];B[qh];W[cc];B[mc]LB[nc:a]C[The large knight's move of B11 is questionable, after 	White settles the shape with W12 to W22, Black clearly incurs loss, with B11 for Black to make the small knight's move at 'a' is better.];W[qc];B[qd];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[qe]

;B[iq];W[qq];B[qr];W[qp]LB[nq:a]C[The attachment and retreat of W32 and W34 are not necessarily to White's advantage, for White to simply make the diagonal extension at 'a' is better.];B[or];W[nq];B[nr];W[eq]LB[mn:a]C[W38 breaks away from the main battle field, this is also a product of fast games, White should reinforce at 'a'.];B[no]C[The striking move of B39 is severe.]
;W[on];B[mo];W[qm];B[ql];W[pl]C[The attachment and cut of W42 and W44 are good moves for dodging.];B[om];W[qk];B[qn];W[rl];B[rm];W[rf];B[ol];W[of]
;B[oh]LB[ql:a][pk:b][me:c]TR[qh]C[The jump of B53 is an overplay, after White jumps with W54, White invades with W56, Black himself is also very thin, with B53 Black should take at 'a', if W 'b', then W 'c', treating the marked stone lightly, this way Black is favorable in the game.];W[mf];B[kd];W[hc];B[fe];W[he];B[kf];W[ff];B[ef]
;W[gf];B[ql];W[pk];B[nj];W[qm]LB[ed:a]C[W66 taking the ko is a mistake, White should double at 'a', cleanly capturing Black's several stones.];B[cb];W[bb];B[ql]LB[ed:a][eg:b][dc:c][cd:d][gd:e][rn:f]C[B69: But Black fails to grab the chance, Black shouldn't take the ko, instead should make the diagonal at 'a', next W 'b', B 'c', W 'd' and B 'e', making life, White dare not initiate the ko at 'f', Black is not necessary to take the ko at 69.]
;W[ed]C[White captures several stones with W70, the situation already has been turned around.];B[fr]LB[qm:a]C[B71: If Black strengthens at 'a', White will hane at 71, Black is no good.];W[qm];B[cl];W[fn];B[eo];W[dm];B[dl];W[go];B[gn];W[fm]
;B[hn];W[ci];B[fk];W[gm];B[hm];W[hl];B[gl];W[il];B[do];W[co];B[em]LB[ho:a]C[B89 and B91 are bad moves, Black should reinforce at 'a'.];W[en]

];B[di];W[bi];B[dh]
;W[dk]LB[cg:a][bd:b]C[W118: White should double at 'a', Black will be in a painful fight. In the game, White overlooks Black's tactic of striking at 'a', allowing Black to turn his body around.];B[cj];W[ck];B[bk];W[bj];B[bd];W[bc];B[fi];W[gk];B[bg];W[al]
;B[ch];W[bl];B[gh];W[ig]LB[eg:a]C[W132 again is a slow move, White should hane at 'a', Black's two groups will be still hard to connect together.];B[ce];W[df];B[eg]C[B133 and B135 are good moves, Black already lives.];W[fd];B[de];W[ee];B[bf]
;W[rn]C[Here White clearly fails in the fight. Luckily White is still able to start the ko with W140.];B[ql];W[ei];B[ad];W[cd];B[be];W[qm];B[gc]LB[hb:a][ib:b][ic:c]C[The bump of B147 finding a ko threat is the losing move of this game, Black should attach at 'a', if White answers at 'b', Black's cut at 'c' is still a ko threat, and this also will help Black's eye shape on the right side, this variation is clearly better than the real game.];W[hb]
;B[ql];W[gp];B[fp];W[qm];B[gd];W[hd];B[ql];W[kg];B[qm];W[lg]LB[ne:a]C[W158: White should make the diagonal extension at 'a', Black's big group is going to die.];B[sf]C[After the hane of B159, White can't kill Black.]
;W[sg];B[se];W[ph]C[Luckily White has the good wedge of W162, White's stones also make life.];B[pf];W[pg];B[qg];W[pe];B[rg];W[pi];B[pf];W[qf];B[rj];W[rk]
