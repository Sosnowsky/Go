Source: Sports Weekly,
Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[pd]C[In this game, Hu Yaoyu's play is far more brilliant than Lee Changho's, his victory is rational.];W[dd];B[qp];W[dq];B[oq]
;W[qj];B[do];W[co];B[cn];W[cp];B[fc];W[cf];B[dm];W[fq];B[ci];W[qg];B[pf]LB[nc:a]C[B17 is rarely seen, the common move is to make the small knight at 'a'. The play in the real game is more offensive, this is also one example of Lee Changho's style changes.]
;W[re];B[pi];W[pg]LB[qi:a]C[The steady play of W20 is to block at 'a', Hu's counterattack conciousness is very strong, he is not willing to play steadily in this kind of places.];B[rd];W[qe];B[qd];W[pj];B[lc]C[Black turns the body around with B21 and B25.];W[of];B[pe];W[ng]
;B[md]LB[qi:a]C[Through B29, they make compromise, the result is about even in this new shape. If Black were a belligerent player, Black probably will consider to fight at 'a'.];W[qn]LB[db:a]C[W30 is the move that shows White understands Lee Changho very well. The common move is to jump at 'a', this is a huge move, especially when Black is thick on the right side.];B[db];W[cc];B[oo]C[But Black answers with B31 and B33, undoutedly White takes advantage with W30. With B31 for Black to answer at 32 is relatively better.];W[gc]C[After the game, W34 is considered the winning move!  Since nobody imagined Black elected to play as in the real game!];B[gb];W[hb];B[hc]
;W[gd];B[ib];W[fb];B[ha];W[ec];B[hd];W[fd]C[Comparing with White obtaining a huge profit with W44, Black only becomes thicker and thicker, of couse Black incurs loss. With B35 Black should fight at 'a', Black should have nothing to fear of.]LB[ed:a];B[cg];W[bg];B[bh];W[dg];B[ch]C[After this move, it is time for lunch break.]
;W[nq];B[np];W[mq];B[or];W[mp]C[W50 and W54: White plays near Black's thickness, White is no good, for White to make extension at 'a' is better.]LB[jq:a];B[hq];W[rp]LB[jp:a]C[W56: White attaches over, it is too rigid. For White to make extension at 'a' is better.];B[ro];W[qo];B[rn]
;W[pp];B[qq];W[rm];B[rq];W[pm];B[kp]C[B65 turning around is a good move!];W[ko];B[lo];W[mo];B[ln];W[op]C[W66 and W70: White captures several useless stones, it is not big.];B[ep]
;W[eq];B[go]C[The shape of B73 is beautiful, Black's situation is not bad.];W[ej];B[lp];W[bf]C[B75 is thick and a valuable move, but the atari of W76 is more urgent! In the real game, W76 is not only a big move and also White reinforces W74, Black incurs loss.];B[dj];W[ei];B[ni];W[oj];B[nh];W[rh];B[lh]LB[mk:a]C[B83 is inexplicable, Black's influence concentrates at the bottom, so to play at around at 'a' is just the right direction.]
;W[mn];B[mm];W[lm]C[Lee Changho perhaps overlooks the cut of W86! W86 is really a good move, when running out together with Black, White takes chance to reduce Black's potential.];B[nm];W[ll];B[nk];W[on];B[mk];W[kn];B[jp];W[jk];B[mg];W[in]
;B[lq];W[mr];B[lr]LB[jh:a][ih:b]C[B97 and B99 are unbelievable slow moves! Black ignores the vital point at 'a' but strengthens steadily, since at the bottom White doesn't have any severe tactic to attack. Black should play at 'b', its value is really too big!];W[oe];B[od];W[jh]C[After White jumps with W102, Black's territory at the top is reduced to the minimum and also White forms a potential in the center. If proceeding normally, Black origionally will lose big, but afterwards, Hu Yaoyu seeks to play steadily, plus Lee Changho's endgame skill is indeed the best in the world, finally Hu Yaoyu only won by 1.5 point.];B[ig];W[jg];B[hg];W[ii]
