;W[qq];B[kq]C[B7: Black tenukis and make the extension on the side, this tactic is adopted quite often by Cho 9p.];W[pp]LB[rp:a]C[W8: For White to play the hane at 'a' is also very common.];B[qo];W[pr];B[ql];W[qf];B[qe];W[pf];B[qi]LB[nc:a][nd:b]C[After the diagonal's extension of B13, recently Cho 9p has used the extension and clamp of B15 very often, perhaps he has done some research, the usual move is to play at 'a' or jump to 'b' after the diagonal of B13.]

(;W[nc]LB[od:a][oc:b][nd:c][pe:d][of:e][pc:f][mg:g]C[W16: White normally will attach at 'a', then B 'b', W 'c', B 'd' W 'e', B 'f' and W 'g', this way although White is thick, but because Black makes two two-space extensions on the right side, White's thickness can't be fully utilized (see var a), so White elects to approach the corner with W16.];B[nd];W[md];B[ne];W[oc];B[od];W[pc]
;B[qc];W[qb];B[ng];W[pi];B[pj]LB[oh:a]C[B27 is the proper move, if Black hanes inward, White will counter-hane at 'a', Black instead has no good follow-up.];W[oi];B[rb];W[rc];B[qd];W[ra];B[mc]LB[qh:a][og:b][lc:c][oj:d]C[But the cut of B33 is over-hasty, Black first should extend at 'a', exchanging for W 'b', then cut at 33, this way White's eye shape would be much worse comparing to the real game. If White reinforces with the tiger's move at 'c', Black can attach at 'd' to capture two white stones, Black is not bad.]

;B[qj];W[ke];B[mg];W[id]LB[kd:a][lb:b][ih:c]C[W50: White should squeeze at 'a' to exchange for B 'b', then jump to 50, this exchange indeed should not be reserved. In spite of this, in the game, up to the jump at 'c', White is not bad either.];B[kd];W[kf];B[ib];W[oj];B[kh];W[if]

;W[cr];B[eq];W[cn];B[cg];W[fo];B[fr];W[dg]LB[jp:a][jq:b][ip:c]C[The attachment of W76 makes trouble for himself. I feel that White should play the shoulder hit at 'a', then B 'b' and W 'c', this way White is easier to play.];B[df]C[The counterattack of B77 is inevitable.];W[ch]

;W[ed];B[fe];W[gf]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.];B[fd];W[db];B[gc];W[bb]LB[fh:a]C[W98 looks like not damaging to White, but Lee Changho apparently has neglected the good diagonal's move at 'a'!];B[fh];W[eh]C[In order to connect safely, White has no choice but to atari at 100.];B[fj];W[gh]
;B[mk]C[B101 and B103 are both sente.];W[rg];B[ij]C[Through the cap of B105, in just a few moves, Black has formed a potential in the center, however White's big group is still not completely safe, the outcome of the game becomes unclear.];W[ko];B[jn]LB[jo:a]C[The shoulder hit of B107 is again a good move! If White pushes at 'a', then Black is just right to play the hane, White doesn't have any follow-up maneuver.];W[pn];B[qn];W[jp];B[jq];W[ip];B[mq]
;W[hp];B[gq];W[cm];B[oq];W[nq]C[The exchange of B117 for W118 is unnecessary.];B[em];W[kn];B[oh];W[og];B[fi];W[fg];B[he];W[ki]
;B[mh]LB[ji:a]C[The connection of B127 is a mistake, it is absolutely gote to White on the right side. Black should hane at 'a' to capture W126, this way Black in the center would be extremely thick.];W[hj]C[W128: White gets to strike first, the situation becomes complicated.];B[hk];W[gj];B[gk];W[ik];B[jj];W[fk];B[gm];W[jk];B[kj]
;W[ek];B[im];W[kk];B[lj];W[hn];B[hm];W[iq];B[ir];W[dk]LB[ej:a][dj:b][ck:c][hh:d][gi:e][jg:f]C[W146 is a decisive losing move for this game! Here White indeed needs to reinforce, otherwise if Black attaches at 'a', W 146, B 'b', W 'c' and Black has the clever wedge at 'd'! White will instantly collapse! In the game, White should reinforce at 'e', this way Black has no any tactic of capturing five white stones by the diagonal's move at 'f', Black's big group itself is still not secure, so White's few stones in the center is not dangerous at all.]

;B[mn];W[ml]LB[nl:a][ri:b][lm:c]C[W160 is the last losing move! White should make the diagonal's move at 'a', making a miai of 'b' and 'c', White will get one, this way White still have a chance.];B[lm]C[The retreat of B161 is a calm move.];W[ri];B[qm];W[sk];B[pl];W[ol];B[ok]

Cho Hunhyun wins back one game, the game 4 will take place on 8/6.])
