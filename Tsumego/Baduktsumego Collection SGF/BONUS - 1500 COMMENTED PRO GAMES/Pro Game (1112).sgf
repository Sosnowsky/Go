;W[jd]LB[qj:a]C[W6: Normally White will split at 'a', in the real game, W6 making extension on the side is also very big.];B[cn];W[fq];B[cf];W[cd];B[dj]LB[cl:a]C[With B7, B9 and B11, Black's tempo is fast, but it is left with the invasion defect at 'a', Black also takes some risk.];W[qn]C[White's joseki selection following W12 is very powerful at this situation.];B[ql];W[on]
;B[nq];W[pk];B[qo];W[rn];B[qk];W[pj];B[pl];W[ol];B[qj];W[pi];B[qh];W[op];B[pq]LB[oq:a][qq:b]C[B27: If Black blocks at 'a', White can strike at 'b'.]
;W[om];B[kq];W[og]C[White successfully condenses Black.];B[qg];W[cl]C[Next White obtains sente and gets to invade with W32. It seems White opens up the situation.];B[dl];W[dk];B[ek];W[ck];B[dm];W[cj];B[di]
;W[ch];B[dh];W[cg];B[dg];W[bf]C[The sequence from B33 to W44 is basically natural, White obtains lot of territory.];B[cq];W[cp];B[bp];W[dq];B[br];W[cr];B[bq];W[mc]C[The most important is, White again gets to play the last big point with W52.]
;B[hq]C[B53 is not small, but ......];W[hr];B[gr];W[gq];B[ir];W[hp];B[iq];W[en]C[......, but White handles lightly from W54 to W60, Black's position is low.];B[me];W[pf];B[qe];W[bn]LB[ci:a][bi:b]C[W64: White is alert. Since Black doesn't exchange B 'a' and W 'b', Black can't resist.]
;B[fl];W[cm];B[dn];W[bo];B[dr];W[er];B[ds];W[nd];B[ne];W[oc]C[W72 and W74 are crude but very practical.];B[oe];W[kc]C[Through W76, White plays brilliantly, White is winning.]
;B[po]C[B77 is the vital point for the shape.];W[qi];B[ri];W[rh]LB[ph:a]C[W78 and W80 are good moves, this way W 'a' becomes absolutely sente.];B[rk];W[qm];B[nk];W[ok];B[ed];W[ec];B[gd]
;W[ee]LB[jg:a][ll:b]C[From W88, White's bad moves don't stop. In just 10+ moves, White gives the game to Black. With W88, White should play at around 'a' or 'b'.];B[fe];W[de]C[W88 and W90: White spends two moves here, not sure what the purpose is!];B[ni];W[np];B[mq];W[gm]LB[lm:a]C[W94 can be said the losing move of this game! To jump at 'a' is the only move.];B[mm]C[After Black makes knight with B95, ......]
;W[qf];B[rf];W[mg]TR[me]C[White has to get out with W98 near the iron head of B61 (the marked stone). White is not far from losing the game.];B[lh];W[si];B[rj];W[lg];B[kh];W[kg];B[jg];W[jh];B[jf]

;B[eo];W[em]C[In the end, not sure whether W122 is miscalculation or not.];B[fm];W[fn];B[gn]TR[gm]C[Black pushes and cuts with B123 and B125, W94 is being captured, White's situation is already very bad.];W[fo];B[el]C[Zhou Ruiyang only plays well in the first half of game.];W[go];B[hn];W[fg];B[gh]
