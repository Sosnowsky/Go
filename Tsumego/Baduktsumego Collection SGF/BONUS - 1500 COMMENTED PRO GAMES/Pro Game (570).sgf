;W[po];B[md]LB[pe:a][ld:b]C[B7 is a positive play, the standard "Shusaku Style" is to make the diagonal's extension at 'a', the two-space tight pincer at 'b' and the play in the game are all modern plays.];W[ne]LB[oe:a]C[W8: White can also jump to 'a'.];B[qg]LB[pf:a]C[B9: For Black to make the knight's move at 'a' is also joseki.];W[me];B[kd];W[gc]LB[ld:a]C[W12: If White plays the wedge, White most likely will end in gote.]
;B[le];W[mc];B[lc];W[nd];B[mb];W[ld]C[Through 18, it leads to a complicated ko fight.];B[oo]C[B19 is a proper ko threat.];W[on];B[op];W[lf]LB[pm:a]C[W22: By joseki, White should hang at 'a', then Black will take the ko in the upper right, White is not easy to handle.];B[md]
;W[qc];B[nc];W[ke];B[pd];W[pc];B[ld];W[nb]C[W30 is a dazzling move, it seems Black can fight.];B[qj]LB[qi:a]C[The value of B31 is not small, otherwise if White forces at 'a', Black is not comfortable. So far Luo Xihe has used 2 minutes, Nakano 17 minutes, Luo Xihe still plays very fast.];W[je];B[nn]LB[ob:a]C[B33: Black strikes first to attack, because Black can ko-live by playing at 'a', White has no maneuver to kill Black completely with just one move.]
;W[qk];B[pk];W[pl];B[ql];W[rk];B[rl];W[ol];B[rj];W[qn]C[From W34 to W42, Black has taken sente and can be satisfied.];B[id]LB[ic:a]C[B43 is a strong move, to make the knight's move at 'a' is general idea.];W[nm]
;B[mn];W[ie]LB[jd:a][jc:b][ic:c][ib:d][hc:e][kb:f]C[W46: If White directly pushes at 'a', then B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e' and B 'f', in the game White wants to give up one more stone, but it is a little unreasonable.];B[hd];W[jd];B[jc];W[ic];B[hc]C[B51: Black strikes back bravely.]
;W[ib];B[hb];W[jb];B[kb]C[Through B55, it again leads to a ko fight.];W[kc];B[ec];W[dc]LB[jc:a][ob:b]C[W58 is inevitable, if White connects at 'a', then B58, because Black is still left with ko-living at 'b', White is no good.];B[jc];W[dq];B[cq]
;W[eq];B[cp];W[kc];B[ed];W[de];B[jc];W[hq];B[kc];W[kq]C[Through 70, an exchange has resulted, Black has nothing to complain.];B[qp]C[B71 is related to the bases for both sides.];W[ep];B[cj]C[W72 and B73 are all good points, each side gets one.]
;W[dn];B[bn]C[The exchange of W74 and B75 is not necessary to White's advantage.];W[ch];B[mc];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[lg]C[B81 is a good move, on the surface it seems Black tries to destroy White's outside influence, in fact Black aims at White's group in the lower right corner.];W[he];B[gd];W[mf];B[jg]C[Luo Xihe is pondering.]
;W[ge]LB[kf:a]C[W86: White is tenacious in order to win the game, if connecting at 'a', White has to way to compete.];B[ee];W[ef];B[db];W[fe];B[eb];W[df];B[cc]C[Through B93, Black has gained a huge territory, White has to make profit in the center.];W[ni]C[W94: White has no choice to enclose the center.];B[ej];W[fd]
;B[gb];W[gj];B[ip];W[ko]C[W98: White fights back bravely.];B[iq]C[B99: Black is not softhearted.];W[in];B[hp];W[jr]C[W102 is worth study.];B[hn];W[go]C[W106: White already has no other choice.];B[jn]C[B107 is a tesuji to manage.]
;W[im];B[jo];W[lm]C[W110: White is ferocious and relentless.];B[jm];W[ln];B[lp];W[kp];B[jk];W[il];B[jl];W[ok];B[pj];W[ck]C[W188: White tries to mess up the situation, but it appears White breaks away from the main battle field.]
;B[hk]C[B119 is an inevitable counterattack.];W[gl]C[W120 is clearly one step slow.];B[hl];W[hm];B[ik];W[gm];B[gk];W[fk];B[fj]C[After Black cuts with B127, White instantly seems weak.];W[gi];B[fl]C[B129 is a good move to gain sente.]
;W[ek];B[fm];W[ho]C[Black is pondering.];B[dk];W[el];B[em];W[dl];B[dm];W[dj];B[cm];W[bk];B[gq]C[After B141, White sinks into a difficult situation.]
;W[gp];B[gr];W[cr];B[br]C[So far, Black has used 59 minutes, White 24 minutes.];W[bs]C[W146: White has no other alternative.];B[dr];W[ds];B[cs];W[fc];B[fb];W[cr];B[fq]
;W[er];B[fp];W[eo];B[fo]C[Through B159, White has clearly failed in the fight.];W[nq];B[qm];W[pn];B[rn];W[ro];B[oq];W[sn];B[nr];W[mq]
