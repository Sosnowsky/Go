;B[ci]C[Zhou Heyang, who takes Black, elects to play the recent variation of "Chinese Fuseki".];W[kc]C[W8: If White approaches the corner, it easily will lead to a fierce fight.];B[nc];W[hc];B[fc];W[he];B[bp];W[qm];B[kq];W[iq];B[nq]C[The opening through B17 is very steady.
];W[or]LB[pq:a][np:b]C[W18 is territory-oriented move, locally White can also descend at 'a' or press at 'b'.

;B[nr];W[oq];B[no];W[cq];B[dl];W[cd];B[cc];W[cg];B[bd];W[eh];B[gf]LB[qi:a]C[B29: Black tangles too much. If I were Black, I will take tenuki and make extension at around 'a', which is just the last big point on the board.];W[be]
;B[ce];W[dd]C[W30 and W32 are not-easy-to-find good dodging moves.];B[bf];W[de];B[cf];W[df];B[ge]C[B37: Black connects back B29, which is very necessary, being separated by White is too damaging.];W[ec];B[eb];W[ed];B[fd]LB[di:a]C[The exchange of W38 and W40 with B39 and B41 is bad. White should simply make diagonal at 'a', if the game proceeds as in the real game, later on White can separate Black at 41.]
;W[di]LB[fb:a][db:b][gb:c][dg:d][eg:e][dh:f][ef:g][ae:h][ej:i][dk:j][hi:k]C[In the game, since the variation up to B41 was already played, I think White can only cut at 'a' with W42, next B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f', W 'g', B 'h', W 'i', B 'j' and W 'k', this variation is better than the real game.

;B[ch];W[bg];B[dg];W[eg];B[ag];W[cl];B[dk];W[dh];B[bh];W[dj];B[cm];W[ck];B[do]C[White destroys some black territory, but as a whole White is thin.]
;W[fk];B[ep];W[eq];B[cp];W[dq];B[qo];W[qp];B[rp];W[rq];B[qi]C[Black presses White with B57 and B59, obtains precious sente and gets to play the last big point with B67, Black is favorable for the game.];W[on];B[ke]C[The cap of B69 is good point, White's two-space extension appears thin.]
;W[ph];B[qh];W[pf]C[W70 and W72 are a way to fight for a victory. If White tries to live several stones W8 and W10 painfully, Black is very easy to take control the situation, White is difficult to have a chance to win.];B[md]C[The diagonal of B73 is good move!];W[gb];B[fb];W[je];B[jf];W[kd];B[ie];W[le];B[jd]
;W[kf]C[From W76 to W82, White allows Black to take one stone, White appears a little far-fetched, however same as W70 and W72, White wants to complicate the situation then seek chances. Here we can see, Lee Sedol is very alert to win/loss in an unfavorable situation.];B[ql]LB[fi:a][ej:b]C[The timing of B83 making ko threats is too early, Black should first take advantage at 'a', since White can't reinforce the ko at the top cleanly with just only one move, and White is heavy and Black is light, White can't exert power on the left side. If White connects at 'b', Black then can consider to create ko threats with B83.];W[pl];B[pm];W[qk];B[rl];W[rk];B[lf];W[je];B[pk]LB[rm:a][ol:b][pj:c]C[The atari of B91 is damaging ko threat, Black should simply turn and atari at 'a'. This way White perhaps can only retreat at 'b' to answer the ko threat, next ko threat is not B91 but the diagonal at 'c' instead, it makes a big difference comparing with the real game, where Black's one stone is being captured in a ladder.]

;W[jg];B[hf];W[mh];B[rj]C[Heyang may have overestimated the result of ko-fight. In fact, Black also paid a considerable price on the right side. After the exchange, the situation is still to Black's advantage, but Black didn't already defeat White.];W[sk];B[ob]LB[ma:a]C[B123 is very big, otherwise White's crossover at 'a' is sente.
];W[pb];B[na];W[pe];B[rc];W[rb]
;B[rd];W[km];B[hi];W[em];B[dm];W[en];B[eo];W[go];B[bq];W[gh];B[hh];W[mp]C[The strike of W140 is the last place for White to fight for a win.];B[jm]
;W[jl];B[ir];W[hr];B[ip];W[hq];B[np];W[mo];B[kn];W[lm];B[jq]C[Black handles very well from B141 to B151, this black group is in fact already alive, White also didn't take any advantage. If playing endgame normally, Black will win the game by a small margin.];W[im];B[mq];W[lr]LB[mn:a][ln:b][lo:c][mm:d][lp:e]C[Not sure whether the strike of W154 is a trap that Lee Sedol set up, or he also saw it wrong. If Black answers correctly, W154 is a damaging move, Black should cut at 'a', next W 'b', B 'c', W 'd' and B 'e', Black is already alive.
]
;B[is]C[But under time pressure, Black releases the last move and also the losing move --- B155.];W[ks]LB[kr:a][ls:b][ms:c][jr:d]C[After the diagonal of W156, Black's big dragon dies suddenly! Black originally thought, with B 'a' Black will live, but White has simple connection at 'b', B 'c' and W 'd', Black doesn't have enough eye shape. Heyang lost this game very regrettably.
