Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[Go tournaments seem never to stop, quickly there comes another new year's Fujistu Cup. In the first round, Zhou Heyang 9p takes White against Cho U 9p.];W[dc];B[de];W[cp];B[pp]LB[cc:a]C[B1 is Cho U's favorite, but When W4, B5 taking the empty corner is a variation, normally Black will attach corner at 'a'.]
;W[od];B[eq];W[do]C[The diagonal of W8 is steady.];B[cc]C[The corner-attachment of B9 is a big point, if Black plays somewhere else, White's pincer will be very big on the back of W4 and W8.];W[ci]LB[iq:a][hq:b]C[W10: White can also pincer at 'a' or 'b'.];B[dd];W[ec];B[bd]C[In the real game, W10 is one step closer, of course Black elects to hang at 13, this way White's two stones become heavy.];W[ic]LB[oc:a][pc:b][jc:c]C[W14: The common move is to make two-space extension, but after Black attaches the corner at 'a' and 'b', White doesn't have any good move at the top, if White fails to strength, Black may invade at 'c'.]
;B[oc];W[nc];B[pc]C[Black takes the corner with B15 and B17.];W[nd];B[qf];W[fd]C[After the small diagonal of W10, both sides' shape is not bad.];B[iq];W[nq];B[oq];W[np];B[pn];W[kq]C[But Black gets to take the super big point with the extension of B21, as a result, after White approaches in with W22, White can only make the narrow two-space extension with W26, Black seems to be more satisfied.]
;B[io];W[ko];B[dl]C[Black  takes the most eye-catching spot with B29, Black seems to lead by one step, but White doesn't fall behind too much all the time, White's tempo is steady.];W[fo];B[gq];W[ei];B[fl];W[dq];B[ep];W[cn];B[cm];W[eo];B[bn]
;W[bo];B[dn];W[co];B[gi];W[ff];B[hl];W[eg]C[W46 is a thick original move, it appears slow, but White can stand solidly on his feet, it is more steady comparing to "striking first blindly".];B[nr];W[mr];B[or]C[B47 and B49 are both offensive and defensive play.];W[ql];B[lm]
;W[km];B[kl];W[ln];B[jm];W[mm];B[kn];W[ll];B[km];W[mn];B[rm];W[cf]LB[df:a]C[The knight's move of W62 is a planned move since the earlier diagonal of W46, but as to White, the regrettable thing is, in the real game Black's push at 'a' is just working, otherwise the corner will be terribly exploited.];B[df]
;W[ce];B[cg];W[bg];B[dg];W[bf];B[cd];W[ek]LB[db:a][ch:b][bh:c][di:d][dj:e][cj:f]C[W70: White descends at 'a' to kill, otherwise B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e' and B 'f'. With W70 White tries to prevent this tactic.]
;B[cj]C[The attachment of B71 is a good move to dodge.];W[ch];B[bj];W[eh];B[bb];W[db];B[ac]C[Through B77, Black's corner and side all make life safely and Black passes a difficult time.];W[rl];B[qm];W[pm]C[White turns to the right side and delivers the intense tactic with W78 and W80, but it seems a little unreasonable.];B[pl];W[om]
;B[pk]C[Black separates White with B81 and B83, Black is not soft-hearted.];W[qj];B[pj];W[qi];B[on];W[nl];B[nj]LB[ph:a][lk:b]C[The jump of B89 is a calm good move, next the jump at 'a' and the atari at 'b' become two good points, Black must get one.];W[pg];B[qg];W[pi]
;B[lk];W[jr];B[mh]C[The selection point of B95 is correct, Black is optimistic.];W[pe];B[qe];W[jo];B[in];W[kg]LB[lf:a]C[W100 is a game-deciding move. If White elects to play at 'a', then Black will play at 100, both sides enclose their own territory, White's future is very difficult.];B[lf];W[ni];B[mi]
;W[lg];B[pf]C[When W104, the push of B105 is a calm move.
];W[nh];B[mg];W[mj];B[mk];W[oj];B[lj];W[ok];B[kf]C[Although White captures three stones with W110 and W112, but Black presses in with B113, White at the top gets destroyed, this is not to White's advantage.];W[ig];B[jg]
;W[jf];B[jh];W[je];B[ld];W[kd];B[md];W[ih];B[lb];W[of];B[ro]C[The jump of B125 is a declaration of victory.];W[nb];B[ob]C[White incurs a small lose in the following endgame, finally Black is leading about 10 points on the board.]
