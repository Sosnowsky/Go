;W[pi];B[qh];W[oj];B[nk];W[mm];B[lk];W[pg]LB[km:a]C[W48 is a questionable move. Right now the lower side is important, it must be wrong for White to end in gote at the top. White should jump to 'a' instead.];B[kn];W[km];B[nn]C[B51 is a good move, reducing liberties and messing up White's shape as well.];W[nm]

If Black can hane at 'a' first to exchange with W 'b', then play at 65 to kill White, White would have no place to strengthen in the lower left corner.];W[eq]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.]

(;B[fo]LB[hm:a][in:b][im:c][hl:d]C[B83 is too conservative.

Black should first play at 'a' to exchange for W 'b', then play at 87. Wang Lei said he didn't expect White could atari at 'a' and 'c', reducing Black's points in the center and Black's liberties, and also forcing Black to play one more move at 'd' to get out, White has taken advantage.]
