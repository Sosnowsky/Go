;W[de];B[dn];W[cc];B[bo]LB[di:a]C[B9: For Black to force at 'a' is relatively common among Chinese players.];W[ci];B[er];W[dd];B[ec];W[cb]C[Through W14, as to this shape, most Chinese players feel White is relatively satisfied, this perhaps is due to the big komi in China.];B[jc];W[od]
;B[mc];W[pf]LB[qc:a][rc:b][pc:c][qg:d]C[The joseki selection of W18 is correct. If White attaches at 'a', then B 'b', W 'c' and B 'd', this way the stone of B15 is just in the right place.];B[oc];W[nd];B[nc];W[pd];B[pc];W[qe];B[rd]C[In the game, through B25, although locally Black is favorable in the joseki, but the position of B15 is not right, both sides gain some profit.]
;W[mq];B[ph]LB[pl:a]C[B27: Black forces tightly, aiming to attack, but it is worth study. Black can consider to split at 'a', this position is just right, Black has nothing to complain.];W[pk];B[qi]LB[nh:a]C[After the counter-pincer of W28, B29 is a more weird move. With B29 for Black to jump at 'a' is still relatively normal. The two questionable moves of B27 and B29 are the main reason why Black gets into a bitter battle in this game.];W[le];B[mh];W[kd];B[kc];W[ie];B[gd]
;W[hd]LB[hc:a][ge:b]C[The diagonal of W36 is a good move. If Black hanes over at 'a', White can hang at 'b' very happily.];B[ge]C[Black has no other choice but to counterattack with B37.];W[hc];B[gc];W[ig];B[gh];W[ii]C[Through W42, White sticks his head out smoothly, however Black has two lonely groups, White's advantage is obvious.];B[dh];W[ch];B[df]
;W[cf];B[cg];W[bg];B[dg];W[bf];B[rk];W[fq];B[eq];W[bm];B[co];W[qm];B[jq];W[jp]C[The attachment of W58 is a strong move.]
;B[ip]LB[kp:a][kq:b]C[If Black hanes at 'a', White will cut at 'b', in the game, Black elects to retreat with B59, White scores again.];W[kp];B[qq];W[pq];B[iq];W[oi];B[oh];W[ni];B[nh];W[lj]C[W68 is a good point, White's advantage becomes more obvious.]
;B[rm];W[qn];B[jo];W[rn];B[qg];W[kq];B[kr];W[lr];B[ko];W[jr]LB[io:a][in:b]C[W78 is a conservative play in a favorable situation. White can consider to cut at 'a', if Black kills at 'b' strongly, White can sacrifice and fight adequately.];B[ir]

;W[kk];B[rl];W[gk]C[W108 is a good move, Black is hard to resist.];B[gl];W[rb];B[qb];W[sd]C[After White crosses over with W112, Black's problem of insufficient territory is very clear, Black already can't redeem.];B[cm];W[bl];B[fj];W[sg];B[rh]
