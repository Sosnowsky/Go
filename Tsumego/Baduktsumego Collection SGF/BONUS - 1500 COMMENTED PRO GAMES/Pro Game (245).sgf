Translation:GoGameWorld.];B[qd]C[In this CSK Cup, with the help of my teammate, we luckily won the champion, but unfortunately I didn't win this valuable game.];W[dd];B[pq]C[In this situation, our Chinese team still won the champion, I think our future result will become better and better. Although I lost this game, I personally feel that I learned a lot from it.];W[dp];B[fc];W[df]
;B[kc];W[qj];B[qk];W[pk];B[ql];W[pl];B[pj]C[My first feeling is that the play of B13 is an overplay, but in the postgame analysis, Lee Changho didn't think this way. From the process of the game, Black indeed can fight. Therefore with W12, White should connect at 13.];W[qm];B[rm];W[qn];B[rj];W[qi];B[rn]
;W[qo];B[ri];W[qh];B[oj];W[oh];B[mi]C[B25 is the vital point.];W[oe]C[I spent a lot of time on W26. Now I feel it is not easy for me to fix the shape.];B[qf]C[Lee Changho quickly releases B27, this is just the vital point.];W[pf];B[qg]LB[pm:a]C[But next B29 is a careless move! Black should first cut at 'a' and wrap up, this way White is difficult to continue.]
;W[rh];B[pg];W[oi];B[ro]LB[og:a]C[B33: In the game, because Black didn't wrap up, Black dares not push out at 'a', White is successful instead.];W[og];B[od];W[pd];B[pc];W[pe];B[rc];W[qp];B[pm]
;W[om];B[ol];W[pn];B[ok];W[pm];B[nd];W[rp];B[so];W[ne];B[mq];W[lp]LB[mm:a][mk:b][kq:c]C[W52 is direct attack, Lee Changho suggests a slow attack with W 'a', B 'b' and W 'c', this way he feels White is not bad.]
;B[lq];W[kp];B[kq];W[jp];B[jq];W[mj]LB[mk:a]C[In fact the play in the game is also possible, but White suddenly changed his mind, W58 is a very bad move! Playing at 'a' is the pivotal point! This way seeking to attack as a whole is very severe, Black has not good follow-up. In the game, White thinks capturing one stone can be satisfied, in fact the situation is already even.];B[ml];W[lj];B[nm];W[no];B[kl];W[ip]
;B[me];W[mf];B[jk];W[lf]LB[ji:a]C[W68 is a very thick move, but some pros also suggest the knight-attack at 'a'.];B[ck];W[ci];B[cn];W[db];B[hd];W[md];B[mc];W[le]
;B[lc];W[iq]LB[cq:a][bo:b]C[When I played W78, I feel that Lee Changho was a little surprised, but after Black played at 'a', I started to regret. I originally thought he dares not strike inside, that way I feel my situation is fine. But this is the place of deciding the game, how Lee Changho can be soft-hearted! White should play the knight's move at 'b' to grab territory.];B[cq];W[cp];B[dq];W[bq];B[br];W[bp];B[fq];W[ep];B[gr]
;W[fp];B[gp];W[go];B[fn];W[ar]C[After W92, I was already in overtime.];B[ir];W[si];B[rk];W[sl];B[sm];W[sj];B[rl];W[dl]
;B[hm];W[lm];B[ll];W[eq]LB[cl:a]C[W104 is a bad move! I already saw the tactic over here, but the timing is just not right, White should block at 'a', Black is not easy to handle.];B[er];W[hq];B[gq];W[hr];B[hs];W[fs];B[gs];W[dr]
;B[cr];W[ds];B[fr];W[bs];B[dk]C[In the game, although White gains locally by capturing four stones, but the attachment of B117 is severe! The difference on the outside is bigger.
];W[el];B[ek];W[fl];B[ei];W[jr];B[is];W[il];B[im]
;W[hl]LB[hp:a][ho:b]C[W126 can be regarded as the losing move! Because the shape by playing at 'a' is bad, I always hesitate to play it. But in the game, after Black's hane at 'b', White already has no chance of playing it. In the game, being pressure by time, I hesitated for a moment then played W126.];B[ho]C[B127: Black not only connects himself but also forces White to make life.];W[nn];B[km];W[kn];B[ln];W[jn];B[jm];W[fo];B[hp]
;W[pr];B[oq];W[qr];B[cl];W[sh];B[sk];W[en];B[cg]C[Black gets to invade with B143, Black is already taking the lead.];W[dh];B[dg];W[eh];B[eg];W[fh]

After that, even I fight desperately but can't retrieve my defeat.];B[pp]
