;W[cf];B[od]C[The play of B7 protecting the corner is recently very popular in China.];W[ec];B[fd]C[Chen Yaoye also looks very confident, playing steadily.];W[ic];B[ie]C[The cap of B11 appears beautiful, but is this move working?];W[kd];B[mc]C[We still have to wait to judge whether B11 is working or not. But, this move is very damaging to territory, so most players normally don't play this way.];W[lc];B[md];W[kf]
;B[ef]C[Through B17, both sides play very fast in the opening phase. I feel, since White jumps to the center, White's shape is very good.];W[eb]C[Chen Yaoye descends steadily, he especially likes "cash".];B[jg];W[jf];B[if];W[ig]C[W22: The first fight of the game starts here.];B[kg];W[lf]C[The extension of W24 is the original move.];B[lg];W[hg]LB[ih:a]C[W26: White can also extend to the center at 'a'.]
;B[gf];W[gg]C[W28, preventing Black from sticking head out smoothly, is good move.];B[id]C[B29 is good move.];W[hc]C[B31 is the urgent point.];B[fg]C[Today, the game proceeds very fast.
];W[gi]C[The fight in the middle left is very important, the key is who can obtain sente.];B[mf]C[B33 is kind of sente.];W[jd];B[fh]C[B35 is very steady.];W[fi]C[W36: White puts pressure on Black.]
;B[fb]C[The block of B37 is big from territory's perspective and also related to eye shape of both sides.];W[ii];B[cg]C[B39: Park YuongHoon didn't hesitate to play this move. It seems he is very satisfied with the opening today.];W[bg];B[ch];W[df];B[dg];W[bh]C[W44 is a little slow, White should make one-space jump. White at top wouldn't die.];B[cj];W[ge]C[W46: I feel, White can use the cut of three stones as ko threat.];B[hf]
;W[fe];B[ee];W[gd]C[W50: It forms an exchange.];B[ed];W[ff];B[cd];W[de]C[I feel, for Black to make a ko is not good. White has reinforced the center and has nothing to complain.];B[bf];W[cc];B[be];W[bc];B[bi]
;W[qj];B[qh];W[qm]C[The two-space extension of W62 is the original move.];B[qo]C[B63: Black is very clear, there is no big aji in the upper right corner.];W[rd]C[W64 is an asking move, White wouldn't act immediately in the corner and perhaps aims to separate Black in the center.];B[qc];W[oi];B[pl]C[The shoulder-hit of B67 is common maneuver.];W[ok]C[W68 is light, White aims at the cut point in the center.];B[ql]C[Let's do a rough situational judgment. White has 20+ points at the top and on left side, Black has about 25 points in the upper right corner. White is thick in center and easier to play.]
;W[mg]C[W70: White aims to play on the right side.];B[nh];W[pg];B[ng];W[qg]C[W72 and W74: White proceeds with his original plan.];B[fq]C[B75 is big point and simple move.];W[hq]C[W76: Here it is difficult to select joseki.];B[mq]LB[jq:a]C[B77: Park YuongHoon 9p still proceeds with his territory-oriented strategy. I think, for Black to play at 'a' is better.];W[kq]C[Generally, both sides will elect to defend corner. However, from attack's perspective, the center is more important than the lower left corner.]
;B[dr];W[cq];B[fo];W[cm];B[cr]C[B83: Black tries to take sente. The first feeling of B83 is making one-space jump to the center.];W[br];B[ho];W[ko]C[W86: White reinforces himself and also aims at the aji on the right side.];B[mo]C[So far, the territory between them is about equal. White is a little thicker, Black still needs to work hard.];W[qq]C[The strike of W88 is severe.];B[pq]C[I feel this will be a close game.]
;W[mr]C[B90 is good move to borrow strength.];B[nr]C[Both sides enter into over time.];W[lr];B[rj];W[rk];B[ri];W[qk];B[rg]LB[rl:a]C[B97: Black crosses over, but I feel Black will incur loss in the lower right corner. So, for Black to extend at 'a' is the right move.];W[ph];B[qf];W[qi]
;B[rh];W[pf];B[qe];W[rm]C[White turns to fight in the lower right.];B[ir];W[iq]C[W106 is the key point. Black's group in the lower left becomes lonely and needs to settle right away.];B[dq]C[B107 is very big. Park YuongHoon alertly takes territory and makes himself thick.];W[cp];B[hr]C[After B109, it seems Black is leading in territory. If White can handle thickness well, White's situation is also not bad. But White at bottom instead becomes lonely group.];W[jr];B[gq]C[The situation is very close.]
;W[or];B[pr]C[With clamp of B113, Black's situation is not good, but they basically returns to the start running point.];W[me];B[mh]C[B115 is order, otherwise Black in the center will come under attack.];W[is]C[Both sides are in over time, the situation becomes more intense.];B[gs];W[nn]C[W118: White aims to capture White at big scale.];B[mn];W[nm];B[nq]C[B121 is a big endgame and also kind of sente.];W[io]
;B[bd];W[ba]C[W124: White has no choice but to reinforce the corner first.];B[ne]C[B125: Black decides to give up the big point in the lower right corner, to make himself thick.];W[ro];B[rp];W[rn]C[W128 is huge move. If I were Black, I will play in the lower right first.];B[pn];W[pm];B[sp]C[B131 is only 2-point endgame, but Black doesn't want White to cross over.];W[ep];B[bs]C[Black ensures 55-point territory and has no weak point.]
;W[ar];B[hn];W[hp]C[White has 45 points and White in the center is thick.];B[fm];W[en];B[fn];W[bk];B[lb];W[kb];B[ld];W[kc];B[ck];W[cl]
;B[mb];W[ns];B[oq]C[B149: All shapes on the side and in the corner are basically settled, except the center.];W[gp];B[fp];W[jm];B[eo];W[dn];B[bj];W[bl];B[mk];W[no];B[mm]C[B157 and B159 have no points, but Park YuongHoon 9p still seeks thickness.]
;W[hl]C[W160 is good move. So, Black should jump to 160 with B157.];B[gl];W[hk];B[os];W[el]C[B163 is gote 4 points, but W164 has no points.];B[do];W[co];B[em];W[ll];B[ml];W[kj]C[W170: Due to Black's slow move, White forms 5 points in the center. But W164 is bad move, Black's loss is not big.];B[im]
;W[qp];B[rq]C[B173: Park YuongHoon's situational judgement is very accurate.];W[dl];B[hm];W[jl];B[gc]C[B177 is good tactic to exploit opponents.];W[je];B[hb];W[ib]C[The situation is still very close];B[ea];W[da];B[fa]
;W[dc];B[lk];W[fl];B[fr];W[ha];B[kk];W[di];B[ad];W[jk];B[ki];W[ji];B[lj];W[kh]
;B[jj];W[jh];B[le];W[lh];B[mg];W[gk];B[ij];W[hj];B[ej];W[dj];B[ei]C[After B207, Black wins the game for sure, even if the situation is very close.];W[dk];B[ah]
;W[nj];B[lp];W[ms];B[eg];W[fj];B[ga];W[gb];B[hs];W[js];B[hb]C[B219: All endgame advantage can be used as ko threats.];W[eq];B[er];W[gb]
;B[dm];W[cn];B[hb];W[rf];B[re];W[gb];B[ac];W[ab];B[hb];W[ia]C[W232: White loses ko fight.];B[pe];W[of]C[The following process has nothing to do with the outcome of the game.]
;B[kp];W[jp];B[kl];W[sj];B[si];W[sk]C[Park YuongHoon plays endgame perfectly and won in the end.];B[kn];W[km];B[lm];W[li];B[kj];W[ek];B[eh]

;B[aj];W[gm];B[np];W[oh];B[nf];W[jo];B[ln];W[gb];B[ag];W[hb]C[The second phase comes to an end, the third and final phase will take place from 2/6-2/9 next year in Shanghai, China.])
