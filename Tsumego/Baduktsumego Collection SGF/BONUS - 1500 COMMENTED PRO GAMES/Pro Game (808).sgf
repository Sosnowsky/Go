;B[oq];W[qj];B[ql];W[qf];B[qh]C[B9 and B11 are Cho 9's usual plays.];W[of];B[nc];W[rd];B[pi];W[qc];B[kc];W[fp]C[White can get the chance to attach with W18 and has nothing to complain.]
;B[cj];W[gq];B[cp];W[cq];B[do];W[ep];B[cf];W[fc];B[cc]LB[co:a][bq:b][bd:c]C[Black enters into the corner with B27, it is a variation for Cho 9p, he normally will connect at 'a', after White stands at 'b', then Black will make the knight's move at 'c', probably due to the big komi, Black wants to be more proactive.];W[cd]
;B[bd];W[be];B[bc];W[ce];B[eb];W[ec];B[fb];W[df];B[bo];W[bq];B[dm];W[pj]C[The attachment of W40 is a huge move.];B[ni]
;W[oj];B[ng];W[ol];B[qn];W[mk];B[gc]LB[lq:a]C[The hane of B47 is a little questionable, because the two-space extension at 'a' is the biggest point on the board.];W[gd];B[hc];W[mq]C[In the real game, after being checked by W50, White's opening is successful.];B[mo]C[The capping move of B51 is inevitable, otherwise if White grabs this spot, White would be thick across the board and also White would have more territory.];W[np]LB[kq:a]C[The sequence after W52 to separate Black is the style of Jiang 9p, the common play is always jumping to 'a'.]

;B[jo];W[md]C[W80 is a good move! White has not only separated Black but also restricted Black's territory to the second line.];B[nf];W[oe];B[mc];W[ld];B[kh];W[lc];B[lb];W[kb];B[jb];W[kd];B[ka]
;W[jc];B[kb];W[kj];B[kn];W[mh]C[W96 is a strong move.];B[lf]LB[oh:a][nh:b]C[B97: Black is reluctant to connect at 'b', it is a little cumbersome, but as for the result, after White strikes at 'a' and captures two white stones, White is clearly favorable for the game, So, at any rate Black should connect at 'b'.];W[oh];B[nh];W[oi];B[nd]
;W[ne];B[me];W[ie]LB[nq:a]C[W104 is not a simple and clear play, White should atari at 'a', White is obviously leading in territory.];B[hd];W[he];B[ge];W[gf];B[fd];W[hg];B[ih];W[gi]LB[fe:a]C[W112 is the losing move, White should atari at 'a' to link up his stones completely.]
;B[ef]C[The clamp of B113 is a good move, Black has turned the game around, this move represents Cho 9p's special alertness and sharpness to victory and defeat.];W[dg]LB[ij:a]C[W114: If White makes the knight's move at 'a' and Black tenukis and ataris at 114, White can't capture the center black stones unconditionally.];B[ff]C[After being bumped by B115, White is not easy to obtain the connection.];W[eh]LB[di:a]C[W116: No matter what, White should jump to 'a'! this way White still have a chance to win the game.];B[gh];W[hh];B[ii];W[ej];B[bi]C[After Black makes the diagonal's extension with B121, White is already not favorable in territory, moreover, White's center big group is still not alive, Black has made a turn-around.]
;W[ig];B[hf];W[hj];B[ij];W[kg];B[lj]LB[kf:a][jf:b]C[B127 is a good move! White still can only connect back at 'a', otherwise Black could capture four white stones at the top. After this move, Black's victory can not be altered.];W[kf];B[jd];W[ke];B[li];W[ch]
