Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[pd]C[In the 2nd game of the 10th LG Refined Oil Cup final, Choi Cheolhan and Lee Changho fight big in the endgame, from outsider's view point, no double Choi Cheolhan uses his shortcomings to fight against the opponent's strong point! Although he learnt his lesson and saw Lee Changho's strong point, but Choi Cheolhan's courage and fighting spirit is really worth praising.];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[fq]
;W[hq];B[qo];W[kq];B[cq];W[dq];B[cp];W[do];B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[eq];B[cn]C[Through B17, in the opening, the situation is even.];W[nc]
;B[qf];W[pb];B[qc]LB[fc:a]C[B21 makes the situation simpler, in terms of strategy , White is favorable, so it is better for Black to play at 'a' to seek variation.];W[kc];B[cf];W[fd];B[bd];W[cc];B[dh];W[em]LB[cj:a]C[W28 is Lee Changho's top-rated thick play, for White to invade directly at 'a' is  also playable.]
;B[ld]LB[mq:a]C[At any rate, the play of B29 should be reserved, Black should directly play at 'a'.];W[lc];B[nd];W[oc];B[mq];W[qn]C[W34 is a good move! Black is difficult to answer, since B29 is territory-damaging, with W34 White only needs to settle quickly, B29 will come to nothing.];B[ql]C[Black counterattacks with B35.];W[qp]C[But following W36 White simply makes life, Choi Cheolhan has no place to exert power, the situation enters into Lee Changho's tempo.];B[pp];W[ro]

;W[qm];B[he]C[The purpose of B53 is not clear, with such a steady move, Black perhaps thinks his situation is still not bad, this move should be reserved.
];W[hc];B[fo];W[fr];B[dn];W[cj]LB[en:a][dl:b]C[W58 is a nimble move! It ruins Black's tempo. Generally speaking, White can't take tenuki, but if White plays at 'a', Black will jump to 'b', next White is difficult to destroy Black's side territory.];B[en];W[bh]C[Although Black is happy with B59, but W60 makes Black painful, this exchange is playable for White.];B[ee]
;W[fe];B[ff];W[cl];B[bm];W[gf];B[fg];W[cg]C[The play of W66 and W68 is in good order! White takes advantage on both the upper and lower side, making Black very painful.];B[dg];W[bf];B[ce];W[hf]C[W72: Black's side territory all disappears, White is favorable.];B[bk]
;W[bj];B[ek];W[bl];B[je];W[if];B[md];W[od];B[oe];W[pe];B[mc];W[qd]LB[mb:a]C[White doesn't incur any loss in the exchange of W84, but normally White will answer at 'a', it is simpler and clearer in a favorable situation.];B[pf]
;W[pc];B[mb];W[de];B[df];W[ej]C[The sequence following W90 is a good and simple way to settle the shape, this kind of play simplifies the situation quickly, White is easier to keep advantage.];B[ch];W[bg];B[fj];W[ei];B[fi];W[fk];B[fl];W[gk]
;B[dj]C[B99 is a tesuji, otherwise locally Black will collapse.];W[fm];B[dk];W[ck];B[hj];W[el];B[eh];W[jf]C[After this move, it is time for lunch break.];B[hd];W[ib];B[jc];W[jb]
;B[kd];W[ge];B[iq]LB[rd:a]C[B113 is tesuji! This is also Black reserved privilege after B59, but its timing is not good, Black should first probe White at 'a', since Black has ko threat at the bottom, White can't play that strongly and doesn't retreat at all as in the game.];W[jq]C[W114 is the only defense, otherwise White will incur a big loss.];B[gq];W[gr];B[hp];W[hr];B[ip];W[ir];B[rd]
;W[rc];B[qe];W[pd]C[After W124, there is a ko in the corner, but unfortunately Black doesn't have ko threats.];B[rb];W[sc];B[om];W[of];B[ne];W[mg]C[White's thick play following W130 doesn't leave Black any chance to initiate the ko.];B[lg];W[lh];B[ng]

;B[oj];W[nr]C[When White eliminates the hidden trouble with W160 and plays the beautiful tesuji of W174, Choi Cheolhan can only parry the blows.];B[nq];W[or];B[pr];W[mr];B[lq];W[ls];B[lo];W[ij];B[jj];W[kj];B[jk]
