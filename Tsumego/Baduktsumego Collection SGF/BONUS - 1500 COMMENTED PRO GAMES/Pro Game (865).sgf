;B[do];W[co];B[cn];W[cp];B[fc];W[cg]LB[cf:a][dm:b][fq:c][ci:d]C[W10: If White play at 'a', then B 'b', W 'c' and B 'd', this variation is also possible.];B[dn];W[fq];B[cj]
;W[dc];B[ic];W[oq];B[op];W[np];B[nq]TR[qp]C[The play of B17 and B19 is rare when the marked black stone is at small point.];W[pp];B[oo];W[pq];B[po];W[mq];B[nr]
;W[mr];B[no];W[mp];B[qq];W[or];B[pr];W[ns]C[Through W32, Black obtains sente. In terms of whole game's configuration, Black can be satisfied.];B[qg]LB[qj:a]C[B33 serves two purposes and is better than playing at 'a'.];W[jd];B[jc];W[kd]
;B[he];W[jg]C[The reduction tactic of W34 to W38 is common.];B[ln]C[B39 is a mutual good point.];W[qn];B[qo];W[pk]C[The invasion of W40 and W42 is inevitable.];B[ee]LB[gd:a]C[B43: Black prevents White from piercing through at 'a'.];W[df];B[lg]LB[qc:a]C[B45: Black attacks White and indirectly prevents White from entering the corner at 'a'.]
;W[ie];B[id];W[ji];B[li];W[lk];B[kj];W[pm]C[W50 and W52 are good moves to dodge.];B[qj]LB[qi:a]C[B53 is to guard against W 'a', taking away White's base.];W[nm]LB[mo:a]C[W54: White fixes shape and also aims to push and cut at 'a'.]
;B[ol];W[nl];B[nn];W[lm];B[kn];W[jl]C[Through W60, White can be satisfied.];B[jj];W[nc];B[ob]LB[pc:a]C[B63 is better than playing at 'a', having more attacking power.];W[od]LB[pc:a]C[W64 is good move, White aims to play hane out at 'a'.]
;B[pe];W[oe];B[of];W[nf];B[og];W[mh];B[mg]C[Black's sequence from B65 to B71 is strong, but Black takes a big risk.];W[pc];B[oc];W[qc];B[nb];W[ne]C[White fights tenaciously from W72 to W76. Here the fight is very important for both sides.]
;B[ng]LB[mc:a][pf:b]C[B77: If Black plays at 'a', White will play at 77. Since Black has cut point at 'b', Black is not good.];W[mc];B[pb]C[B79 is good move.];W[qe]C[W80 is a probe.];B[qd]LB[pf:a][qb:b][lb:c][mb:d][ma:e][na:f][oa:g][ra:h]C[B81: If Black play at 'a', then after W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 'e', W 'f', B 'g' and W 'h', White still can make life in sente.]

;B[re];W[lc];B[kb];W[se];B[rf];W[sb]C[W98 and W100 are basic skill to make life. So far, White is clearly taking the upper hand.];B[rc];W[sd];B[rm]C[B103: Black destroys White's eye space, otherwise Black can't win the game.];W[im];B[io];W[hf]LB[le:a][km:b]C[W106 is slow. White can make life cleanly by playing one move at 'a'. So to reinforce at 'b' is more important.]

;B[hh];W[lh];B[ge]LB[ik:a]C[B141 is big mistake, for Black to play atari at 'a' is just the right move.];W[hj];B[hi];W[hl]C[White's counterattack from W142 to W144 is very severe.];B[jh];W[kh];B[ki];W[fk]C[Through W148, Black simply dies.
