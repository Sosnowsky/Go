;W[nc];B[po];W[qf];B[nd];W[md];B[ne];W[oc];B[pc];W[me];B[mf]C[B15 turning at the head is a recently popular play in Korea.];W[pg]
(;B[nf]LB[ng:a][kc:b][pj:c][od:d][oe:e][pe:f][rd:g][oi:h][oj:i][nh:j][nj:k][mh:l][lf:m]C[However, B17 is a clumsy move. Black should hang at 'a', If White still makes the extension at 'b', then Black can grab the good point at 'c', followed by W 'd', B 'e', W 'f', B 'g', W 'h', B 'i', W 'j', B 'k', W 'l' and B 'm', Black would encircle the right-side territory while attacking White (see var a).];W[kc]
;B[qi]C[The position of B19 is not good.];W[oh];B[re]C[After White sticks his head out with W20, Black can only reinforce the corner with B21.];W[pj];B[qk];W[ol]C[With the two capping moves of W22 and W24, Black has been pressed down as a whole and Black's shape is still very thin.
];B[np]
(;W[pm]LB[ql:a][pk:b][ok:c][pl:d][om:e][qn:f]C[W26: If White attaches at 'a' directly, Black can push at 'b', then W 'c', B 'd', W 26 and B 'e', Black would fight by sacrificing (see var a). So White can only compress Black with W26, later on White can take the chance to separate Black at 'f'.];B[rm];W[mq];B[pk];W[ok];B[oj];W[pi]
;B[nj]TR[qi]C[As for the sequence from B29 to B33, Black has no other choice but to separate White. Although Black's shape is not good, if Black doesn't cut White here, Black couldn't find any other good way of playing. So the marked black stone is indeed questionable.];W[qj];B[rk];W[mh];B[lj];W[ll];B[lo];W[qn];B[rn];W[qo];B[ro];W[pp]
;B[qq];W[oo]
(;B[no]LB[nq:a][nr:b][pq:c][mr:d][qr:e][or:f][pr:g][ns:h][rr:i][sp:j]C[B47 is a wrong sequence play. Black should first push at 'a' to exchange for W 'b', then play B47. Thus when W 'c', Black can cut at 'd', if White still hanes at 'e', Black can counter-atari at 'f', W 'g', B 'h', W 'i' and B 'j', Black makes life on the spot (see var a).];W[pq];B[nq];W[qr]
;B[rr];W[rq];B[rp];W[rs]C[The sequence from W50 to W54 are good moves.];B[sq];W[nr];B[mr];W[lr];B[or];W[ms];B[pr]TR[rs][sq]LB[qs:a]C[Due to the exchange of the marked white and black stone, after the cut of B61, Black still needs one more move at 'a'.]
;W[pn];B[qs];W[lp]C[W64: White has grabbed the vital point, thus White is leading in the game.];B[nm];W[mk];B[mj];W[kh];B[lm];W[ml];B[ki];W[kk];B[jh];W[kg]
;B[ji];W[mn]C[W76 is a good sequence play.]
(;B[mm]LB[mo:a][ko:b][kn:c][jn:d]C[B77: Black can only connect here. If Black instead connects at 'a', then White would hane at 'b', B 'c' and White double-hanes at 'd', Black has no answer (see var a).];W[mo];B[nn];W[km];B[kn];W[jm];B[jn];W[mp];B[ln]
;W[im];B[in];W[hm];B[iq];W[kq]C[W90 is the vital point. White lives completely with just one move so that Black couldn't make any use of it.];B[go];W[fn];B[fq];W[jg];B[hh];W[ig];B[gj];W[dn]C[White becomes totally thick, and White's advantage is clear.]
;B[dr];W[dj]LB[qe:a][rd:b][pb:c][qb:d][ob:e][rb:f]C[W100: White is careless. White should first push at 'a' to exchange for B 'b', then play W100, this way White would be left with the big endgame with the hane move at 'c', B 'd' and W 'e' (If Black tenukis, White can clamp at 'f').];B[qe];W[ih];B[ii];W[hi]LB[li:a][kj:b][gf:c][gi:d][hj:e]C[W102 and W104: White is overzealous. Now White only needs to play at 'a', then B 'b' and W 'c', White would be in an impregnable position. In the game, Lee Sedol thinks that Black could only atari at 'd', then W 'b', B 'e' and W 'a', White would capture four black stones.]
;B[lh];W[lg];B[nh];W[ng];B[mg];W[ni];B[mi]C[White has neglected Black's clever moves from B105 to B111!];W[li];B[gi];W[hj];B[lh];W[ij];B[nh]
;W[eq];B[oi];W[fr]LB[er:a]C[W120: For White to push at 'a' is the right shape, but after Black counter-clamps with B120, White can no longer kill Black, therefore in the game White has to go all out to kill Black's big dragon.];B[er];W[gq];B[fp];W[hr];B[gn];W[ir];B[gm];W[gh];B[jq]
;W[jp];B[ip];W[jr];B[dl];W[gk];B[do]LB[fl:a][fk:b][cp:c]C[B135 is overhasty. Kong Jie 7p thinks Black should calmly make the diagonal's extension at 'a', if White answers at 'b', then Black can attach at 'c', because White itself is also weak and can no longer kill Black.];W[eo];B[ep];W[co];B[dq]

(;B[ck]LB[dk:a][di:b][bk:c][bi:d][cm:e][cn:f][br:g][ar:h][bm:i][bn:j][bs:k]C[B149 is also a bad play. Black should squeeze at 'a', this is the vital point, then W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 'e', W 'f', B 'g', W 'h', B 'i', W 'j' and B 'k', Black would make life (see var a).];W[bi];B[cm]

In fact White only needs to attach at 'a', B 162, W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 'e', because White can take the three black stones at the marked position and W 'f' also becomes sente, White would be very thick, so White can play directly at 'g' and achieve a big victory (see var a).];B[bj];W[aj];B[ak];W[bl];B[bg]C[B167 is a good move, White already has no answer.]
;W[ch]LB[ai:a][eh:b]C[W168: If White connects at 'a', Black can turn at 'b', White would still get captured.];B[ai];W[ah];B[bh]C[B171: After Black makes a ko, White will definitely lose the game.];W[aj];B[bp];W[cp];B[ai];W[cf];B[bf]
