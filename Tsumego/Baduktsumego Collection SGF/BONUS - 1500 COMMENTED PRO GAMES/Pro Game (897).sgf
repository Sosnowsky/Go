;W[dq]LB[co:a][cp:b]C[The direction of W6 makes B 'a' become an excellent point, for White to play at 'b' conforms to Go theory.

;B[qn]LB[cp:a][hq:b]C[B17 is hasty! Because White's diagonal hit at 'a' has attack meaning, with B17, for Black to play at 'b' is more urgent.];W[cp];B[ep];W[eq];B[dp];W[cq];B[fp];W[gq];B[qq]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.];W[bo]
;B[dn];W[qp];B[pq];W[op];B[rp];W[ro];B[rq];W[qo];B[nq];W[pn]LB[qj:a]C[W36 is Yoda's first-rate thick play, but by making extension at 'a' directly, White's speed would be faster.];B[qj];W[bn]C[W38 is related to the thickness and thinness of both sides, it is a typical move of "looking small but big in reality". In this situation, if we do a test, W38 will get all 100 points.]
;B[lc]LB[el:a]C[Although B39 is big, but in comparison, for White to reinforce the left side by playing at 'a' is more urgent.];W[nd];B[od];W[ne];B[mb];W[em]C[In the game, W44 hits Black's vital point, Black sinks into a bitter battle.];B[gp];W[hq];B[hp];W[hm]C[W48 is a good move! The value at the bottom is very small, not a place to play.];B[iq]LB[ip:a]C[B49 entices White to cut at 'a' intentionally.]
;W[ip];B[hn];W[jp];B[gm];W[lq]LB[gl:a]C[W54: For White to play hane at 'a' is better.];B[gk];W[cf];B[df];W[dg]LB[cg:a]C[W58: White should retreat at 'a' to obtain sente.];B[bf]
;W[bg];B[ce];W[cg];B[mq];W[lr];B[ni]LB[pg:a]C[The attack with the sequence from B65 to B83 is superficially clever, because so far all basic shapes are settled on the board, grabbing territory becomes important, with B65, for Black to enclose territory at 'a' is better.];W[ng];B[lh];W[kd];B[of];W[og];B[pm]

;W[el];B[ek];W[ej];B[fk];W[ck];B[en];W[ll];B[kp]C[B105 is alert!];W[lp]LB[kl:a]C[Because there is a potential ko at 'a', White has to tolerate with W106, Black gains a lot locally.];B[ml];W[lk]
;B[nm];W[ld]C[But after White strengthens with W110, after a situational judgement, Black's territory is still not enough.];B[fq];W[fr];B[ir];W[hr];B[is];W[gr];B[ko];W[jq];B[ih]C[B119: Black hopes to redeem the situation by attacking.];W[li]C[With the sequence following W120, White makes eyes and destroys Black's territory as well, Black doesn't have any chance.

;W[af];B[ff];W[gf]LB[hi:a]C[So far, with W136, only if White ensures safety by playing at 'a', White would win the game, but after this, White walks towards a "no return" road.];B[gg];W[hf];B[fe];W[fd];B[ge];W[he];B[hd];W[id];B[hc]
