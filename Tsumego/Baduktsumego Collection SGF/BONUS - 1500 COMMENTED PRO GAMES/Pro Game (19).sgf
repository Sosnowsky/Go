;B[cn];W[fp];B[gp];W[fo];B[cq];W[eq];B[cp];W[fr]C[The joseki variation up to W14 was common at that time.];B[fc];W[hc]C[The one-space pincer of W16 is a typical Korean style.];B[cc]LB[fe:a]C[B17: Black is reluctant to jump at 'a' to stir a fierce fight.]
;W[dc];B[cd];W[de];B[db];W[eb];B[cb];W[ec];B[cf]C[After the jump of B25, the game's structure has been settled, it will be a prolonged war.];W[nq];B[pn];W[qi]C[W26 and W28 are steady and good moves.];B[qk]
;W[qf];B[qe];W[pf];B[nc];W[qq]C[W34 entering the corner is a positive play, and it is also the biggest point on the board.];B[pq];W[pr];B[qp]C[The blocking direction of B37 is correct.];W[rr];B[rq];W[qr];B[rf]
;W[rg];B[re]C[B41 and B43: Black tries to prevent the opponent from entering the corner and also take away some eye shape of White's two-space extension, it is commonly used good strategy.];W[kc]C[W44: White resists with Black positively.];B[lq];W[rp]TR[lq]C[W46: When Black invades with the marked black stone, it is important for White to capture one stone, making life himself and also gaining a big profit.];B[ro];W[sq];B[lo]C[B49: Since White has played very steadily, strengthening the weak stones is inevitable. In the opening phase, the moves from both sides are quite normal.];W[cl];B[dm]
;W[dl];B[cg]C[B53 is a good and calm play, waiting for White's move.];W[em];B[oj]C[B55: Black starts to put pressure on White's two-space extension.];W[nh]C[The play of W56 is light and nimble, reflecting Cho Hunhyun's unique style.];B[mi];W[lg];B[oh]C[B59: Black starts pounding at the opponent's weakness, now the game is entering the middle-game fight.];W[oi]C[W60 is a clever maneuver of fixing his shape by sacrifice.];B[ni];W[og]C[The counter-atari of W62 is a common play.]
;B[mh];W[ph];B[mg]C[Through B65, White has basically lived on the left side, Black instead becomes thick in the center, locally the result is even for both sides.];W[dr];B[cr];W[kn]C[W68 is a good challenging move beyond the common sense, it has not only restricted Black's center territory but also expanded his own influence on the left side.];B[jo]C[B69: Black has to fight by piercing through, otherwise Black would be falling behind from a global point of view.];W[ko];B[jp];W[kp];B[kq];W[iq]
;B[jq];W[lp];B[ir];W[hr];B[mq];W[mp];B[nr];W[or];B[js];W[np]C[W84 is the proper move.];B[io];W[ho];B[hn]
;W[go];B[ns]LB[rn:a]C[After Black makes life with B89, the fight on the lower side comes to an end. At a glance, it seems that Black is favorable, but after White becomes thick in the center, White is left with the severe ambush tactic of the clamp at 'a', the outcome of this fight will dictate the balance of the game.];W[rn];B[rh]
(;W[qn]TR[rh]LB[pj:a][pk:b][ok:c][nj:d][ri:e][qg:f][ol:g]C[W92: When Black probes White with the marked stone, White has missed a good chance to establish superiority. White should first play at 'a' and 'c' to separate Black, then block at 'e', Black must capture one stone at 'f', otherwise the marked black stone would become a damaging move. Next White extends out at 'g', although the ensuing fight is still very complicated, but because Black is not stable on both the left and right side, White would be easier to play (see var a).];B[pj];W[qg];B[qo];W[pm];B[on]TR[pj]C[In the game, Black first connects safely with the marked stone, then plays 95 and 97 to fight with White, it is a powerful idea.]
;W[rl];B[rk];W[om]C[W100: White can't bridge over on the first line, otherwise if Black turns at 100, White on the lower and right side will probably all come under severe attack.];B[nm];W[nl];B[sn]C[The hane of B103 is a strong play in the capturing race, it is perfect timing and can represent Yoo 9p's strength.];W[qm]C[The connection of W104 is the best play in the local fight.];B[nn];W[ok];B[ml];W[mk];B[lk]
;W[ll];B[mm];W[lj];B[kk];W[mj];B[kj];W[li];B[nj];W[nk];B[km];W[jn]C[Through W120, the fight on the right side comes to a temporary close, in this exact crucial moment, Yoo Changhyeok releases a slack move.];B[nf]LB[lf:a][ri:b]C[B121: Black should hane at 'a', not only taking care of center but also leaving the future option of playing at 'b' or 121. This way, the game would still be very complicated and the outcome of the game is still anybody's guess.]
;W[ri];B[sg]LB[in:a][jm:b][jl:c][im:d][hk:e]C[B123 is not good either, Black should play at 'a', then W 'b', B 'c', W 'd' and B 'e', it is a good strategy for Black to settle the center as earlier as possible.];W[si];B[sl]C[B125: Although Black bridges over for the time being, but White is left with the possibility of making kos at two places to block the cross-over, it is a rather fatal trouble.];W[lf];B[lh];W[ki];B[kh]
;W[ji]C[After White sticks his head out to the center with W130, White has succeeded in the fight.];B[ik];W[in];B[ij];W[ii];B[hm]LB[oq:a][hl:b]C[B135: Black has expected that White would connect back with the dame move at 'a', surprisingly, Cho Hunhyun attaches at 'b' to counter-probe Black.];W[hl]LB[oq:a]C[W136: White takes advantage of Black's reluctance of giving up two stones now. If White first connects at 'a' then attaches here, Black certainly will treat these two stones lightly.];B[im];W[jj]C[White continues pounding the opponent with the sequence after W138.]

;W[ig]C[W152 is a calm and good move.];B[op];W[oo]C[W154 is an asking move.];B[sm]C[B155: Black connects on the right side staunchly.];W[no];B[po];W[jg];B[kg];W[kf]C[After White pushes and cuts one black stone with W158 and W160, White has already gained in the center.];B[ke];W[je]
;B[sh]LB[mf:a]TR[sm]C[By the exchange of B161 and W162, Black makes sure that the atari of B 'a' is sente, Black captures the white group to guarantee the balance in the territory, this is also one of the reasons why earlier Black elects to connect with the marked stone.];W[od];B[mf];W[if];B[oc];W[so]C[In order to seek compensations, White's strategy is to start a ko at 168.];B[sp];W[sf];B[se];W[so]
;B[gj];W[fj];B[sp];W[qh];B[sf];W[so];B[gh];W[fg];B[sp];W[ls];B[rq];W[mr]C[Through W184, the ko battle on the right side comes to an end, White has killed one black group at the bottom,  as a result, they has made an even exchange.];B[le]
;W[rp];B[di]C[The knight's move of B187 also indirectly looks after the big group in the center, which is the strongest resistance.];W[mb]LB[lb:a]C[W188 is a very common endgame, however surprisingly due to Black's resistance at 'a', they has made another exchange here.];B[lb];W[mc];B[lc];W[ld]C[White has stirred a big change with W190 and W192.];B[md];W[kd];B[jf]C[B195: Black has to take three stones.]
;W[so];B[fi];W[rm];B[sp];W[nd];B[me];W[so];B[sk];W[nb];B[ob];W[kb]C[After White captures two stones with W206, the fight at the top comes to a temporary end. White still keeps a small lead in the game.];B[oe];W[pk]C[W208: White threatens to cut, it appears that this is just one-point small endgame, but because the game is very close, they starts to fight again by a ko.]

;B[ar];W[so];B[nr];W[ns];B[sp];W[bi]C[W240: White eventually elects to give way, in fact, the left endgame is not small itself.];B[rq];W[bn];B[bo];W[rp];B[hs];W[gq];B[rq]
;W[bm];B[ef];W[ff];B[ee];W[fe];B[fb];W[fa];B[fd];W[gb];B[ed]C[Black has gained a big profit with the sequence from B251 to B257.];W[rp];B[so];W[ge]

Overall, loving to fight and seeking variations everywhere should be regarded as one special feature in the fighting between these two great players.])
