Translation:GoGameWorld.];B[qd]C[In this game, Chang Hao didn't play very well. Of course, not allowing the opponent to give full play to his talent is also what Gu Li's good at.];W[dd];B[pq]C[In a fast game, having guessed Black, Gu Li already takes initiative.];W[dp];B[fc]C[The opening with B1, B3 and B5 is Gu Li's favorite.]
;W[hd]C[Certainly Chang Hao knows, so White avoids common variations by using a rare one-space high pincer of W6.];B[oc]LB[fe:a]C[B7: Black avoids a direct confrontation, Black perhaps worried that White has well prepared for it, but to jump at 'a' is not bad at all.];W[fd];B[qo];W[ec];B[fq];W[hq]LB[dn:a]C[W12: White elects to destroy each other's moyo, but considering White is very thick in the upper left corner, playing at 'a' to conduct a territory race would be more efficient for White.];B[cj]C[The splitting move of B13 is interesting.];W[cn]LB[cl:a]C[Because Black first approaches with B11, with W14, White already has no state of mind to force at 'a'.]
;B[cg]C[Therefore Black is glad to play the two-space extension with B15.];W[bf]LB[jq:a][kq:b]C[W16 is questionable! Because White didn't contain Black's two-space extension, W16 lacks severe follow-up tactic, and B 'a' would have expanded Black's moyo at the bottom dramatically, it is huge! White should make an extension at 'b'.];B[jq];W[fp];B[ep];W[eq]LB[eo:a][gp:b][dq:c]C[The original move for W20 is to play atari at 'a', followed by B20, W 'b' and B 'c', perhaps Chang Hao feels that it would be less efficient if the corner is being grabbed by White, so in the game he seeks variation, but the attempt is not successful.];B[eo]
;W[do];B[gp];W[fo];B[en];W[fn];B[dq];W[er];B[em];W[gq];B[fm]C[The turn of B31 is very powerful! Locally White already can't move.];W[cl];B[dl];W[ck]
;B[dk];W[bj];B[bi];W[dj]LB[cq:a]C[Perhaps White feels difficult to play, so White is eager to seek fight with W38, but it is an overplay, White can only tolerate by playing at 'a'.];B[ci];W[ej];B[ce];W[cf];B[df];W[be];B[cd];W[cc]
;B[bp]LB[dr:a]C[B47: Black has missed a good opportunity! Gu Li must have very regretted after White captures with the turn of W 'a'! Because if Black first blocks at 'a' then makes a knight's move at 47, White would collapse locally. A lot of friends often like to play sente moves first, feeling that will be steady. In contrast, professional players like to keep all kinds of aji, this way this game would be more interesting and tasteful, but in the game ......];W[dr];B[cq];W[bo]C[...... after W50, although Black still have some tactic left, but White already gets out of crisis.];B[fi]C[B51: In the chaotic fight, both sides have played very tightly, this is the key in fights, worth remembering.];W[fj];B[gj];W[gk];B[ei];W[fk];B[hm]
;W[gi];B[hj];W[gh];B[fg];W[hk];B[ij];W[ik];B[jj];W[jk];B[kj];W[jm];B[jn];W[kn]
;B[gn];W[fr];B[jo];W[lk];B[ko];W[ln];B[mp];W[gg];B[dn]LB[co:a][bl:b]C[The squeezing move of B79 is a big crude move! Black should throw in at 'a', W79, then the clamp of B 'b' is tesuji! This would be much better than the real game.];W[co];B[bk]
;W[bl];B[aj];W[cm]C[After the connection of W84, all aji disappears.];B[mi];W[nk];B[oj];W[pl];B[qj];W[bg];B[di];W[no];B[np];W[mc]C[White gets to play at 94, the situation already becomes very close.]

;W[nn];B[pm];W[qm];B[qn];W[me]C[W112's consciousness of victory and defeat is strong! Normally strengthening to make life is too slow.];B[nm];W[mm];B[jf]C[B115 is calm, because Black itself is defective, so White can't kill White's dragon.];W[lo];B[lp];W[mj];B[lj]
;W[mk]C[When White plays W120, the situation is very complicated, normally the outcome of the game is subject to the endgame. But now Chang Hao suddenly makes a fatal mistake!];B[ld];W[md];B[jd];W[od]LB[ff:a]C[W124: White certainly should first play hane at 'a' to settle the shape, this is White's sente privilege at any time.];B[pd];W[ob];B[oe];W[pb];B[ge]C[The striking move of B129 is sharp! White's three stones unexpectedly have to way to escape!];W[he]
;B[gd];W[gc];B[fe];W[fb];B[hf];W[gf];B[ie];W[ic];B[de];W[bd];B[lg]C[After B141, Black's center has added 20 points instantly, the game is suddenly over.];W[ig];B[if]
