Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[In the first game of the 9th Korean LG Refined Oil Cup best-of-5 series held on 10/19 in Wuhan, China, Park YuongHoon 9p challenges Lee Changho 9p, I was invited to comment the game live on the big board.];W[dd];B[pq];W[oc];B[md]C[Lee Changho takes Black. As to the corner-approach of W4, Lee Changho still elects to play one-space high pincer.]
;W[dp];B[od];W[qk];B[qo];W[qh];B[nc];W[fq];B[cj]C[Through the splitting move of B13, the situation is steady.];W[cl];B[cf]LB[cg:a]C[B15: Black can consider to make the two-space extension at 'a'.];W[ch]
;B[ef];W[fd];B[di];W[ce];B[bf];W[ic]LB[dh:a]C[As for the result up to W22, Black is still left with the defect at 'a', Black can't be satisfied.];B[jq]LB[kq:a]C[B23 is a positive play, the normal move is to make the extension at 'a'.];W[co];B[cc]LB[dh:a]C[B25 entering the corner indirectly reinforces the defect at 'a'.]
;W[be]C[The counterattack of W26 is inevitable.];B[ec];W[df];B[dg];W[de];B[cg];W[fc];B[fb];W[gb];B[eb];W[eg];B[bb]C[The sequence up to B37 making life is almost inevitable.]
;W[fg]LB[ff:a]C[W38: White has the state of mind to reserve the atari at 'a'.];B[dh];W[lc]C[W40 again should be reserved.];B[qf];W[lp]C[The shallow reduction of W42 shows that White thinks it is a close game and he is relatively optimistic about his situation.];B[jo];W[ln];B[jm];W[ll];B[jk];W[qm]C[Next both sides jump out, White makes one-space extension with W48, White should have nothing to complain.]
;B[cq]C[B49 entering the corner is an asking move, which is the key point of the game.];W[dq]LB[bp:a][er:b]C[W50 is strong and unyielding, if White blocks at 'a' instead, Black will make the knight's move at 'b', White has to capture in the corner by reducing liberties.];B[bo];W[bp]LB[bn:a][cn:b]C[As to the attachment of B51, with the hane of W52 White overlooks Black's common tactic of making the simple extension at 'a'. White perhaps thinks Black most likely will play hane at 'b', then White can cut and atari at 'a', White can fight.];B[bn];W[bq]C[White has no other choice but to play W54.];B[cn]C[After Black sacrifices with the sequence following B55, the center becomes Black's moyo territory, Black is successful.]
;W[dn];B[dm];W[cm];B[en];W[do];B[dl];W[bm];B[ck];W[am];B[hd];W[hc]LB[gc:a]C[As to the peep of B65, although W66 is uncomfortable, but White can only tolerate by connecting at 'a'.];B[fe]C[The diagonal of B67 is severe!]
;W[ge]C[White counterattacks with the hane of W68, but here Black is lighter, White is clearly not favorable to tangle with Black.];B[gd];W[ed];B[gf];W[he];B[pj]LB[hf:a]C[B73 is important order, with this one move, White couldn't turn the head at 'a' any more.

After this move, it is time for noon break.];W[qj];B[id];W[gc];B[ff];W[ie]
;B[hg];W[ke];B[ii]C[Through B81, Black forms a territory in the center, Black achieves a big victory!];W[gn];B[gm];W[hm];B[hn];W[go];B[ho];W[fm];B[gl];W[fl];B[fk]
;W[gk];B[hl];W[ek];B[fj];W[dk]LB[qp:a]C[Although White gains a big profit by capturing several stones with the sequence from W84 to W96, but now White should first attach in at 'a', this perhaps worries Black.];B[mo];W[lo];B[oo]C[In the game, Black strengthens in sente with B97 and B99, the game now enters into the pace that Lee Changho is good at.];W[kq];B[jr];W[il]
;B[im];W[nm];B[mb]LB[re:a]C[Before Black strengthens with the diagonal of B105, White's peep at 'a' is a chance to test Black.];W[ih];B[hh];W[ji];B[ij];W[lb];B[rg]C[After Black reinforces with B105 and B111, it becomes a close game and Black is thicker.];W[qq]C[W112 is a good tactic, taking a big advantage in sente.];B[qp]
;W[pr];B[qr];W[oq];B[rq];W[pp];B[qq];W[pf];B[rh];W[ne];B[nd];W[qc]LB[ob:a]C[W124: White should first descend at 'a' (one point damaging) then attach, this way later on Black probably has to capture by reducing liberties.];B[pb]C[As to the attachment of W124, B125 is a good move!]
;W[qg];B[qe];W[ri];B[lj];W[nr];B[op];W[np]C[W130 and W132 are the last losing moves. At any rate, White should first strike in the center.];B[pg]C[In the game, Black settles the shape in sente with B133, White's small defeat is already decided.];W[of];B[ni];W[ph];B[ng]
;W[og];B[gp];W[fp];B[ld];W[kd];B[gq];W[gr];B[hr];W[li];B[pi];W[qi];B[kj];W[hq]
;B[hp];W[ki];B[mi];W[no];B[fr];W[er];B[ej];W[el];B[on];W[kr];B[nn];W[mn];B[gs]
;W[bk];B[ps];W[nk];B[or]C[Facing Lee Changho's endgame, Park YuongHoon has no interest to continue and concedes defeat very early.

The game 2 will take place on 11/1.])
