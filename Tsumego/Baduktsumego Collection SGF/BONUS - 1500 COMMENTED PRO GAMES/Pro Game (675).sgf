Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[In Go arena, to become a high hand, only if you defeat Lee Changho, you will be recognized. In the 40th Wangwi best-of-5 series, Lee Yeongkyu 5p lost to Lee Changho by 0:3 and didn't pass the test.];W[dp];B[cn];W[fq];B[dc]
;W[de]LB[ci:a]C[W6: White elects not to take the empty corner, aiming to destroy Black's intention of playing at 'a' with B7.];B[bp];W[pp];B[ce]C[B7 and B9: Black grabs territory aggressively, forcing Lee Changho into his not so skillful situation, Black's fighting strategy is obvious.];W[cf];B[cd];W[df];B[ed];W[cl];B[cq];W[co]
;B[bo];W[dn];B[dm];W[cm];B[bn];W[em]C[W14 to W22 are common joseki.];B[nc];W[dj]LB[dl:a]C[Next W24 is an update, strengthening the top side, it is better than taking at 'a' in the past.];B[nq]LB[qn:a]C[With the joseki selection of B25, Black loses the invasion at the bottom, Black can consider to approach at 'a'.]
;W[lq];B[pn];W[np];B[mp];W[mq];B[qp];W[no]LB[oq:a]C[When cultivating moyo, W32 is important, here it is very easy to play at 'a' impulsively as joseki, this way Black will first play atari at 32, White's moyo will be reduced a lot.];B[qq];W[oq];B[qk];W[kj]C[W36 is excellent feeling.]
;B[ff]C[B37: This gives Black no proper invasion point, and Black has to reduce from outside.];W[nj];B[eh];W[di];B[er];W[fr];B[ii];W[jh]LB[ik:a]C[W44: White perhaps doesn't like to conduct a big territory race and elects to destroy each other's moyo, in fact, to enclose at 'a' first is also very substantial.];B[ih];W[jg];B[jj]
;W[kk];B[ig];W[jf];B[il]C[B51: Black dives into White's territory and can be satisfied.];W[if];B[eq]LB[jm:a]C[But B53 is unnecessary, to destroy territory at 'a' is simple and clear, Black can fight.];W[hf]C[W54: White takes tenuki alertly.];B[fp];W[gp];B[go]C[B57: Black's strongest play is to cut at' a', but after White retreats at 'b', Black's big dragon in the center is dangerous.]LB[gq:a][hp:b]
;W[ep];B[fo];W[hp];B[ho];W[ip];B[fm];W[fl];B[gl];W[es];B[dr];W[fk];B[gk]TR[hf]C[Through B69, White has the addition of W54 (the marked stone), a very valuable move, and also get to protect the lower territory, definitely White is very successful.]
;W[qm]C[The probe of W70 is good timing.];B[pm]LB[qn:a][qf:b]C[Perhaps since White incurs loss in the last war, Black counterattacks angrily with B71, but this just falls into White's trap. With B71 Black should tolerate at 'a', this way White can't play at 'b' in sente, the situation is still early.];W[ql];B[pl];W[rk];B[rj];W[qj];B[pk];W[ri];B[rl]
;W[sj]C[W80: White takes one stone in sente, White's profit is too big!];B[rm];W[qf]C[Since W82 becomes sente.];B[od];W[hc];B[kc];W[bf];B[fc];W[ad];B[bc];W[mc]C[W90 is a beautiful tesuji!];B[mb]LB[md:a][pc:b]C[B91: Black exercises patience, it is necessary, if Black counterattacks at 'a', White can strike at 'b', Black is not easy to handle.]
;W[md]C[Lee Changho can take advantage inside Black's fortress, Lee Changho's endgame skill is too good!];B[lc];W[pe];B[pd];W[re];B[oe]LB[rd:a][nd:b][ob:c]C[B97: If Black blocks at 'a', after W 'b' and B 'c', White can enclose a big territory with W97, this way Black's territory is still not enough.];W[rc]C[W98: After White destroys Black's corner, White is already leading in territory on the board.];B[mf];W[qb]
;B[lg];W[ji];B[jk];W[ob];B[id]LB[ke:a]C[B105 is hasty, Black may lose patience while being taken advantage slowly. The original move is to jump at 'a'.];W[nb];B[la];W[jd]C[W108 is relentless!];B[ke];W[jc];B[jb]
;W[ib];B[kd];W[je]C[Through W114, Black again incurs loss.];B[ki]C[B115 is the last-ditch struggle, and at the same time Black is waiting for Lee Changho to make mistakes.];W[lh];B[li];W[mh];B[mi];W[mg];B[ni];W[lf];B[le]
;W[kb]C[But W124 creating ko threats is a good move.];B[ja];W[nf];B[kf];W[ne];B[me];W[nd];B[kh];W[kg];B[ng];W[lf];B[of];W[oc]
;B[lg];W[ma]C[The fatal ko threat of W138 completely destroys Black's illusion.];B[nh];W[lb]C[This is a complete victory for Lee Changho.];B[ko];W[kp];B[mn];W[nn];B[nm];W[pj]C[Lee Changho achieves 11 consecutive Wangwi titles.])
