;W[ck];B[pj];W[nq];B[kp];W[oo]LB[qp:a][oq:b][po:c]C[The knight-press of W10 is very rarely seen. Generally if B3 is played as the small-point at 'a', when White plays the low-approach at 'b', then White will adopt the knight-press move at 'c'. Now B3 is at the star point, White still elects to play W10, it is afraid that only Yamashita Keigo dares play this way.];B[op]LB[qn:a][po:b][qp:c][qq:d][rp:e][pq:f]C[The cut of B11 is a little over-hasty. In fact Black only need to answer simply at 'a' , White doesn't have any good follow-up maneuver. If White dare push and cut at 'b' and 'c', Black can play the atari at 'd', then W 'e' and B 'f', all white stones will get captured. If White takes tenuki, later on Black can stand at 'f', not only getting a big corner and also ruining White's base, Black would have nothing to complain.]
;W[np];B[no];W[lp];B[nn];W[lo];B[kq];W[lq];B[fq]LB[gq:a][iq:b][hq:c][do:d][ip:e]C[The selection of B19 is very difficult. In terms of the regular shape, Black should answer at 'a' making the three-space extension, but this way White can invade at 'b'; If making two-space extension at 'c', after White forces at 19, Black's shape looks restricted. In the game, Black forces with B19, expecting White to answer at 'd', then Black can strengthen back at 'e'.]

(;W[hp]LB[ip:a][dp:b][cp:c][cq:d][ep:e][do:f][eq:g]C[The counter-attack is inevitable, however the selection of W20 is a little questionable. White should answer at 'a' to put pressure on Black's two stones. If Black attaches at 'b', then W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'd' and W 'g'. Because it is very big to capture Black at the bottom, so White is not afraid of Black's turning around his body (see var a).

After this move, it is time for noon break.];B[fo];W[do];B[ko];W[kn];B[io];W[pn]TR[op]C[W26 is severe. This is the hidden trouble of the push and cut with the marked black stone.]
;B[pr];W[pl];B[nl];W[ok];B[mk];W[oj]TR[pj]C[After White kills out with the sequence from W28 to W32, the marked black stone has been clearly damaged.];B[kr]C[After this move, the game was closed for the first day.];W[lm];B[kk];W[im];B[ho]C[However, Black fails to capture White with B35 and B37, Black has incurred a loss.]
;W[qo];B[qp];W[rp]C[After the hane of W40, Black is relatively hard to answer.]
(;B[po]LB[ro:a][rn:b][so:c][on:d][om:e][nm:f][ph:g]C[B41: In terms of Go theory, for Black to cut at 'a' is the tesuji at this time, but this way White will atari at 'b', then B41, W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f' and W 'g', White will take the right side, and Black only gets a false eye and still not completely ensure the safety of the corner, this is surely not to Black's advantage (see var a).];W[on];B[om];W[ro];B[pm];W[qn];B[rq]
;W[qm];B[rr];W[ph]C[After the knight's move of W50, originally the right side is within Black's influence but now it completely disappears, and in addition, White also has made some points. If Black can't obtain a considerable profit by attacking, Black will lose the game.];B[ik];W[hl];B[hk];W[fl];B[dn];W[eo]LB[gk:a][gi:b][hi:c]C[The bump and cut of W56 is not good! White certainly should take tenuki to grab the vital point at 'a'. White's big dragon should be safe only if White can get to play the tiger's move at 'a', also next no matter whether to jump at 'b' or make the knight's move at 'c', White's moyo on the left side will expand dramatically, White's potential is unlimited. No matter how Black to proceed, White's lower-left corner wouldn't be damaged badly.]
;B[en];W[lj];B[lk];W[fn];B[fm];W[jl];B[jm]LB[jk:a][gn:b][il:c][kj:d]C[B63 is excellent! If Black directly connects at 'a', White escapes at 'b', Black will collapse; If Black first squeezes at 'c', then White can directly push at 'a' and cut at 'd', Black can't look after both the left and right sides. In the game, after B63, White instead can't take care of both sides.]
(;W[jn]LB[il:a][kl:b][kj:c][gn:d][km:e]C[W64: If White connects at 'a', then B64, W 'b', B 'c' and W 'd', Black can kill White by playing at 'e' (see var a).

;W[hm];B[gm]C[Originally White tries to kill Black, but now White instead all get killed by B73, White indeed has incurred a terrible loss!];W[ij];B[cn];W[ii];B[kh];W[bp];B[gj];W[gl];B[go];W[jh];B[kg];W[fh]
;B[ej];W[gi];B[kl];W[jm];B[fi];W[eh];B[bo];W[er]LB[bq:a]C[The original move of W92 is to make life at 'a'. Perhaps Yamashita feels that his situation is too bad, so he elects to fight desperately with W92, but this way Black is clearly left with the maneuver of ko-killing White's corner.];B[bq];W[br];B[cd];W[dl]

White's big group is not alive yet, Black still should take advantage by playing the shoulder-hit at 'a', then W 'b' and B 'c', Next no matter whether Black plays at 'd' or 'e', Black will all achieve a big victory.]
;W[md];B[lc];W[li]C[W148: White instead has enclosed a territory at the top by taking advantage of Black not being completely alive. Fortunately Black has a big lead earlier on, finally Black still manages to win the game by 3. 5 points.];B[mh];W[mg];B[mf];W[ld];B[mi];W[mm];B[mj];W[eb];B[bg];W[de]
