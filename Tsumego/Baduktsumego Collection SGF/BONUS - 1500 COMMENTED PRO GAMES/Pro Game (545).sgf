;B[md];W[mc];B[nd]LB[lc:a]C[B21: Black can also elect to play the joseki at 'a'. In the game, White approaches the corner and gets some territory, and also has the potential for further development, however how much profit Black will get from outside thickness is still questionable.];W[nc];B[od];W[pc];B[pd];W[ld];B[le];W[ke];B[kd];W[lc]
;B[lf];W[je];B[mn]LB[pj:a]C[B33: The original move is to jump at 'a', the play in the game is still greedy.];W[pj]LB[ol:a]C[The invasion of W34 is the vital point, if White sticks the head out at 'a', it will just fall into Black's trap, next Black plays hane, White extends and Black will press again, Black takes the chance to enclose territory on the right side, Black's efficiency will be 100%.];B[pn];W[pm];B[qn];W[qm];B[om];W[rn]
;B[nm];W[ql]C[With W40, for White to turn and atari at 41 is also playable, but this variation is complicated. Since this is a fast game, White is difficult to make decision, so White elects the simple atari of W40 and crossover of W42. So far, Black gains profit, but Black's outside influence in the upper right corner seems come to nothing, so overall it is still a balanced situation.];B[dn];W[cf];B[cj];W[go]C[There are many choices for W46, the play in the game is not the best choice.];B[gq];W[gl];B[hn];W[gn];B[ho]C[After Black seals off with B49 and B51, Black's territory at the bottom is still spectacular, however White adds one lonely group, perhaps White is a little optimistic.];W[cl]C[The invasion of W52 is a severe and relatively risky move, but White has to fight desperately like this in order to win.]
;B[el]LB[dl:a]C[The cap of B53 is correct, Black can't press at 'a'.];W[dk];B[cm]LB[gk:a]C[But the diagonal of B55 is inexplicable tone change! Not sure why Black doesn't attack White at 'a'?];W[ek]C[White is able to press with W56, White must have taken a breather.];B[bl];W[bk];B[ck];W[dl];B[bj]
;W[dp]LB[cp:a][ep:b]C[The attachment of W62 is a good move, Black is difficult to answer, since no matter Black plays at 'a' or hanes at 'b', White will counterattack with counter-hane.];B[eq];W[bm];B[ak]LB[bn:a]C[B65 seems to be the losing move, now to hang at 'a' is the correct move.];W[bn]C[After W64 and W66, Black already has no good answers.];B[do]LB[cp:a]C[B67: For Black to hane at 'a' is a little better.];W[cp]
;B[ep];W[cq]C[White easily obtains the corner territory with W68 and W70, White gains a very big profit.
];B[em];W[fk];B[ei];W[gi];B[bg];W[hm]C[W76 becomes sente, White is happy.];B[hp];W[cg];B[bh];W[dr]LB[cr:a][br:b][bs:c]C[W80 is to prevent Black's ko tactic by B 'a', W 'b' and B 'c', it is still a steady move in a favorable situation.]

;B[cb]C[B145 clamping in is Black's last place to fight for a victory.
];W[da];B[cc];W[dc];B[cd]LB[bd:a]C[B149 is a crude move, Black should make the small diagonal at 'a', this way although it also leads to a ko, but Black's loss is smaller after losing the ko fight.];W[de];B[be];W[ae];B[ad];W[af];B[ab]
;W[ba];B[ca];W[ce];B[bc];W[bd];B[fm];W[be]C[After White eliminates the ko with W162, Black's defeat is already decided.];B[gm];W[di];B[dj];W[ci];B[bi];W[ej]
