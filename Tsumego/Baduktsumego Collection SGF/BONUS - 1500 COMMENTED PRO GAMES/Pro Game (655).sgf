;B[ep];W[dp];B[do];W[eo];B[dm];W[fp];B[cl];W[kq]C[The extension of W14 is the first questionable move, White certainly should protect the corner at 'a'.]LB[ce:a];B[de];W[gc]C[W16 is also a questionable move. White should play the attach-and-retreat joseki to contain Black's development on the left side. The reason for White's mistakes is not fully understanding the lower-left joseki.];B[cc]
;W[cb];B[cd];W[bb];B[dh]C[Up to the extension of B21, Teacher Nie thinks Black's configuration is very satisfied. ];W[nc];B[qf];W[pb];B[qc];W[ld];B[mq]C[B27: Teacher Nie thinks for Black to protect the corner with the small knight's move at 'a' would be better.]LB[nq:a];W[qk]
;B[qi];W[qn];B[qp];W[ck]C[The hane of W32 is the follow-up maneuver of joseki.];B[dk];W[el];B[en];W[fo];B[dj];W[cm];B[bl];W[bm];B[bk]

;B[jn];W[ir]LB[mo:a][oq:b]C[The crossover of W56 is not good! Now Black is invading into White's moyo, White is initiative and shouldn't be that conservative. Jumping to 'a' is not bad, next White can strike at 'b'.];B[gm];W[hm];B[gn];W[gk];B[hn];W[ik]LB[cp:a][bo:b][cj:c][bj:d][ci:e][bi:f]C[W62: White should probe Black alertly by playing at 'a', Black's connection at 'b' is a play not damaging to endgame, but Black is left with the hidden trouble of escaping at 'c', Black can only atari at 'd', next W 'e' and B 'f', the taste of Black's side territory is not good.]
;B[hq];W[iq];B[fq];W[eq];B[gp];W[fr];B[kn];W[mo];B[kk];W[hh];B[pn];W[pm];B[om]LB[on:a]C[B73 and B75 show Gueon's positive side, but after the game, she regrets about B75, extending at 'a' is steady.]
;W[on];B[nn];W[po];B[oo];W[no]C[The sequence following W80 leads to a ko fight, which was unexpected by Gueon Hyojin, I think that's Black's mistake under the time pressure.];B[pn];W[cj]C[White is very painful with the exchange of W82 and B83, it is very damaging to endgame.];B[bn];W[on];B[op];W[nm];B[pn]
;W[bj];B[am];W[on];B[gr];W[mn];B[gq]C[Overall, White wins the ko fight, White's situation takes a better turn.];W[cr]C[W94: White makes mistake again, White should connect at 95, this way White can keep threat on Black.];B[er];W[dr];B[fs];W[cp];B[ap]
;W[aq];B[jc]LB[dg:a]C[When Black invades with B101, the first impression of Teacher Nie is that White can't follow Black any more. To strike first on the left side is important, for example, attaching at 'a'. What difference it could make if I respond two more moves? B103 and B107 have a big impact on my center stones, when I start to use my strategy with W108, White's center stones already become a heavy burden.];W[kc];B[ke];W[ie];B[jd];W[mf];B[kg];W[dg];B[eh];W[df];B[ef]C[Black is very clear to seal off with B109 and B111, the exact reason is that she already aims at White's center dragon, if there is no exchange such as W102, Black wouldn't be that easy to play B109 and B111.]
;W[eg];B[fg];W[ak];B[cn];W[ch];B[gh];W[bg];B[cf];W[cg];B[ff];W[be];B[hd]C[After Black pierces out with B123, White's losses outweighs gains. Now White is busy to make life, Black takes control of the game very easily. ];W[gd]
