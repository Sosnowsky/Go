Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[This is a game in the round 8 of 2005 National Go Individual tournament, Xie He 6p who has 7 consecutive wins meets Chen Yaoye 5p who has 6 wins and 1 loss, if Xie He wins this game, then he will win the champion one round earlier. So in fact this is the game to decide the champion.];W[dc];B[pq];W[dp];B[de];W[ce]
;B[dd];W[cd];B[ec];W[db]C[W10 avoids the complicated "large avalanche" joseki, it is a playing psychology.];B[df];W[eb];B[fc];W[bg];B[kd]C[Black makes extension with B15 and has nothing to complain.];W[qj];B[pi]C[B17 is a kind of momentum!];W[qi]
;B[ph];W[qh];B[qg];W[qc]C[W22 is timing to dodge.];B[pc];W[pd];B[od];W[pe];B[qe];W[pf];B[qf];W[oc];B[pb]
;W[nd];B[pg]LB[ql:a][ob:b][oe:c][mc:d][nc:e]C[The connection of B33 is clearly slow! There are two ways to play this move, first, to force at 'a' is an eye-catching excellent point, next White cuts and Black strengthens the corner, second, Black can directly atari at 'b', next W 'c', B 'd', W33 and B 'e', Black can fight.];W[oe];B[qb];W[qm]C[After White takes one stone with W34, White makes extension with W36, but Black doesn't have any severe tactic to attack.];B[me];W[md];B[le]
;W[kc];B[jc];W[kb];B[jb];W[mb]C[Through W44, White makes life, Black is clearly falling behind in the opening.];B[fq];W[jd];B[lc]LB[id:a]C[As to the cut of W46, Black should first atari at 'a', then play B47, this is just the correct order. In the real game, White lives cleanly, Black gains nothing.];W[ld];B[ke];W[lb]
;B[id];W[qp];B[qq];W[rp]C[The set pattern of W52 and W54 is alert! Black's development at the bottom is being contained.];B[mq];W[dn];B[di]LB[fo:a]C[B57 again is a slow move, Black should jump up at 'a', this way White is still relatively difficult to win this game.];W[hq]C[As to the counterattack of W58, the direction of B59 again is wrong.];B[jq];W[eq];B[fp]
;W[jp];B[kq];W[go];B[cq]C[As to the knight-seal of W64, Black makes life painfully in gote from B65 to B73, Black is already in a losing situation.];W[er];B[bo];W[co];B[bp];W[bn];B[cm];W[cn];B[br];W[fb]

;W[ic];B[ie];W[he];B[hf];W[hc];B[gf];W[jk];B[hm];W[ij]LB[np:a][nq:b]C[W96: White is too greedy! Even if White wants to play as in the game, White also should first exchange W 'a' and B 'b'.];B[fo]C[Black attacks W94 and W96 strongly following B97, this is Black's only chance.]
;W[em];B[dm];W[gn];B[il];W[iq];B[io];W[in];B[lk];W[np];B[nq]LB[mo:a]C[B107: Black should counterattack at 'a' instead, in the game White escapes alarmingly and establishes superiority.];W[kl];B[jo]
