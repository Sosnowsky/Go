;W[gq];B[cf];W[fc];B[ci]LB[bd:a][cg:b][ch:c]C[B9: If Black makes the knight's move at 'a', then White may attach at 'b' or counter-pincer at 'c', working well with the large knight's corner enclosure, Black can not be satisfied.];W[ce];B[df];W[ck];B[cq]LB[cp:a]C[B13: Black enters the corner immediately, preventing White from extending at 'a']
;W[cp];B[dq];W[ep]LB[eq:a]C[The retreat of W16 is a way of obtaining sente, if White plays the hane at 'a', then White may ends in gote.];B[fr];W[ej];B[bk]LB[eh:a][gi:b]C[B19: If Black makes the knight's move at 'a', then White will continue to knight-attack at 'b', White's tempo is relatively better.];W[bj]LB[bl:a]C[W20 is an inevitable counter-attack, if White hanes at 'a', then Black will draw back at 20, White ends in gote.]
;B[cj];W[bi];B[bh];W[bl];B[dk];W[cl];B[dj];W[ei]C[The sequence up to 28 is inevitable for both sides, it appears that Yoo Changhyeok can still play boldly and freely even after his defeat in the game 1.];B[fe];W[bf]LB[bg:a][dh:b]C[W30 is a good move, White attacks in order to defend. Black starts pondering, either blocking at 'a' or making a tiger at 'b' is hard for Black to choose.]
;B[bg];W[be];B[dh]C[B33: Black has no choice but to reinforce.];W[fg];B[ff];W[hg];B[he];W[hc];B[je];W[jg]C[Through 40, White looks very fluent, Black appears grievous, but considering that this fight is within the area of White's influence, it is reasonable for White to get the upper hand.];B[gj]C[B41: Black demonstrates a gesture of attacking White as a whole.];W[ij]C[W42 is a light and good move.]
;B[ek];W[qf]LB[qj:a]C[W44: White doesn't play the splitting move at 'a', considering Black's corner enclosure direction in the lower right.];B[pi]C[The pincer of B45 is inevitable.];W[of]LB[qc:a]TR[hc]C[W46 is better than entering the corner at 'a', the reason is that White already has the marked stone in a lower position.];B[rd]TR[hc]C[B57 is a good move according to the current situation, also considering the position of the marked white stone.];W[nd];B[ih]
;W[ig];B[gh];W[hh];B[hi];W[ii];B[gg]C[Through 55, Black has gained a territory of 15 points in the center but ends in gote.];W[nb]TR[pi]C[W56: White forces Black to make life in the corner, the marked black stone looks thin, White is more initiative for the whole game.];B[pb];W[re];B[qc]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.];W[pk]C[The pincer-attack of W60 is inevitable.]
;B[pg];W[pe];B[mh];W[od]C[After W64, Black's corner is still not completely alive.];B[kh];W[jh];B[kj];W[kf];B[qm]C[With the sequence from B65 to B69, Black strikes first to gain initiative.];W[mj]LB[oh:a]C[W70: White aims at the cut at 'a'.];B[nk]C[B71 is the key point of shape, and Black attacks in order to defend.]
;W[ri]C[W72 is an asking move.];B[rb]C[B73: Black thinks now it is time to strengthen the corner to live.];W[mk]LB[oj:a][nj:b][oi:c][ni:d][oh:e]C[W74 is a relatively ruthless play, if White plays at 'a', then B 'b', W 'c', B 'd' and W 'e', White's gain is not that much.];B[nj];W[ml]LB[nl:a]C[W76: If White hanes at 'a', then Black will cut at 76, White has no assurance of success.];B[nl]
;W[mm];B[nm];W[mo]C[W78 and W80: White elects to play steadily, White obviously thinks that he is not falling behind.];B[mq]LB[fq:a]C[B81: Black takes some territory and aims to push and cut at 'a'.];W[fq];B[gr]C[B83: Black is not giving way and aims to obtain sente.];W[bq]C[W84 is a good timing.];B[br];W[er];B[bp]
;W[bo];B[aq];W[dr];B[cr];W[hr]C[From B85 to W92, it leads to an exchange, White has gained some territory but ends in gote.];B[rj]LB[oh:a]C[B93 is a huge move, so far Black is leading in territory, but White is thicker, so the outcome of the game is still not clear. White starts pondering, perhaps he is thinking whether the strike at 'a' is working.];W[qj]LB[rk:a][qi:b]C[W94 is a game-deciding move, testing Black whether to retreat at 'a' or cut at 'b'.];B[kp]C[B95: Black surprisingly takes tenuki, this is very risky.]
;W[rk]TR[mj][mk][ml][mm][mo]C[W96: White captures completely, Black has suffered a heavy loss, if Black can not attack the marked white stones effectively, Black will sink into passivity.];B[ic]C[Although B97 is not a small move, but it seems Black's playing sequence is not well-coordinated.];W[nn];B[mi]C[The exchange of W98 and B99 is worth study, it seems White is not favorable.];W[kk]LB[jk:a][jj:b][kl:c]C[After W100, Black is still left with the tactic of B 'a', W 'b' and B 'c'.]
;B[rh]LB[om:a][mc:b]C[B101 is fierce and relentless, Black wants to prevent White's hane at 'a' with sente, and also aims to attack White with the peep at 'b'.];W[ng];B[nh]LB[qi:a][sj:b][ql:c][oh:d]C[B103: If Black ataris at 'a', then W 'b', B 'c' and W 'd', Black has no good follow-up move.];W[og];B[oh];W[ql];B[pm]
;W[rm];B[rn]C[Through 109, White obtains sente and can be satisfied.];W[hj];B[gi];W[nq];B[nr];W[lq]C[W112 and W114 are intense tesujis, Black is difficult to handle.];B[lp];W[mr];B[mp];W[or];B[np]
;W[oq];B[op];W[pr];B[qq];W[qr]C[Through 124, Black's territory has been completely ruined, Black has no powerful ensuing maneuver, Black's defeat can not be avoided.];B[sm];W[rl];B[ln];W[ao]C[W128: White is going too far.];B[jk]C[B129: Even with closed eyes, you have to play this way.];W[jj];B[kl]
;W[ki];B[lj];W[ap]C[W134: White first takes cash, White is leading in territory.];B[co];W[cn];B[dc]C[B137: Black makes the last-ditch struggle.];W[cc];B[ec];W[ed];B[fb];W[gb];B[fd]
;W[gc];B[cb];W[bc];B[do];W[eo];B[dn];W[en];B[dm];W[bn];B[ld];W[le];B[ea]C[B155 is the best play, White has no way to kill Black unconditionally.];W[bb]
;B[db];W[ga];B[ca];W[fa]C[Through 160, it becomes a multi-stage ko, White's burden is not heavy.];B[ib];W[eb];B[lr];W[ns];B[fb];W[lc];B[ke];W[lf];B[iq]

In the game, White has clearly suffered some losses and Black is also left with the tactic of throwing at 'e' to fight desperately.];B[qh]
;W[eb];B[pj];W[pl];B[fb];W[jr];B[kd];W[ob]TR[qi]LB[qa:a][sc:b][qe:c]C[After W210, the improperness of the marked white stone is easily seen, White originally has two ko threats 'a' and 'b' but now due to Black's throwing in, they are not working any more.];B[hb];W[eb]
