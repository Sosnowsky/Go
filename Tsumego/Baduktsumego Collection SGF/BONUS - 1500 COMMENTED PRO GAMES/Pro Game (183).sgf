Translation:GoGameWorld.];B[pd]C[In the decisive game 5 of the 34th Korean Myungin final, Lee Changho won by half point, his teacher Cho Hunhyun sighed with feeling: "Go is indeed tasteless".];W[dp];B[fq];W[cn];B[pq]
;W[dd];B[ip];W[pn];B[ql];W[op];B[pp];W[po];B[nr]LB[oq:a][np:b][mr:c]C[B13: Black normally will turn at 'a', then W 'b' and B 'c', in the game the simple knight's move entices White want to play in the corner.];W[rp];B[rn]
;W[qp]LB[ol:a][pj:b][mp:c]C[But with W14 and W16, White just helps Black to play B15, it is indeed hard to agree with. With W14, still White's knight's move at 'a' is the correct move, then B 'b' and W 'c'.];B[oq];W[np];B[lq];W[ol];B[pj];W[qf];B[mo];W[qq];B[pr]LB[nj:a][nn:b]C[B25 is slow, simply jumping to 'a' is better, reserving the diagonal's extension at 'b' is very comfortable.]
;W[nn];B[nj];W[ri]LB[qj:a]C[W28 is a good move, making Black very difficult, answering at 'a' seems to have already been taken advantage, in the game Black simply plays tenuki.];B[re];W[pk]TR[pr]C[With the sequence following W30, White captures two black stones, not only White becomes safe and also White gains a big profit, the most important is the marked black stone seems more useless.];B[qj];W[qk];B[rj];W[rk];B[sk]
;W[sl];B[sj];W[rl];B[of];W[oh]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.];B[og];W[rc];B[rd];W[eq];B[fp];W[fr]C[W44 and W46 are Lee Changho's favorite play to settle the shape in sente. When there is nothing to do with thickness or thinness, this kind of play is very substantial.];B[gr]
;W[oc];B[pc];W[od];B[ob];W[nb];B[pb];W[jc];B[mc]LB[cf:a][nh:b][ph:c][pg:d]C[B55: Normally Black will approach the corner at 'a', Black perhaps worries about the aji of W 'b', B 'c' and W 'd'.];W[lc]
;B[ld];W[md];B[kd];W[lb];B[nd]LB[me:a][jd:b]C[But B61 is not appropriate, Black should play the atari at 'a', then W61, B 'b', White extends on the third line, Black takes tenuki to enter the corner, this variation is better for Black.];W[me];B[nc];W[jd];B[kf];W[jf]LB[kg:a]C[After the attachment of W66, White's territory at the top becomes three-dimensional, however Black still need to reinforce at 'a', so capturing several stones is not good, Black's loss overweighs his gain.]

;W[bc];B[kg];W[eg]LB[bi:a][er:b]C[W82 is huge, this way the forcing move at 'a' and the atari at 'b' become miai, White will get to play one, White is optimistic.];B[er];W[dr];B[fs];W[bi];B[ci];W[cj];B[di]
(;W[bk]LB[dg:a][dj:b][bh:c][bj:d][cg:e][dm:f][cq:g]C[W90 is hard to understand, certainly White should play at 'a', this is the vital point for the shape! Next, B 'b', White extends on the third line, B 'c', W 'd', B 'e' and W 'f', this way Black's tactic of entering the corner will disappear, this is clearly better than the play in the game (see var a).];B[dg];W[eh];B[ei];W[gh];B[df];W[ef]
;B[cq]C[Black is able to grab the big endgame of B97, the situation becomes very close.];W[dq];B[cr];W[cp];B[ds];W[mi];B[ni];W[mj]LB[mh:a][nh:b]C[W104 is a little slow, White should extend at 'a', when Black pushes at 'b', it is still not too late for White to attach back.];B[mh];W[nk]TR[md][me]C[With the hane of B105, Black captures the two marked white stones, the hane of W106 is still sente.]
;B[nh];W[mb];B[ne];W[bq];B[br];W[qr];B[mn];W[kn];B[ll];W[jm];B[jk]LB[mk:a]C[The cap of B117 looks like a momentum, but in fact it is not good. After White calmly connects at 'a', because Black itself is thin, Black lacks powerful follow-up tactic. B117 at 'a' capturing two stones is substantial.
];W[mk]
;B[hg]C[With B119, Black turns to ruin White's territory, this is also the hidden trouble left with the mistake of W90 (the marked stone).]TR[bk];W[ek];B[gi];W[hi];B[gj];W[kp];B[lp];W[kk];B[hh];W[hf];B[gg];W[gf]
;B[qs];W[os]LB[rs:a][kq:b][lr:c][kr:d]C[The sequence from W132 to B139 to settle the shape is clearly damaging, perhaps White fails to see the good extension move at 'a', with W132 White should attach at 'b', Black can only descend at 'c' or hane at 'd', then White atari at 'a', this way White will get more points.];B[ps];W[mr];B[mq];W[nq];B[rs];W[rr];B[lr]
