(;SZ[19]EV[Japan Nihon Kiin Autumn Oteai]DT[1930-11-26]PC[Japan]PB[Go Seigen]BR[3p]PW[Hayashi Yutaro]WR[6p]HA[0]RE[B+R]C[At that time, the dan-promotion Oteai was the most important Go event. Because there were Spring and autumn Oteai events, the newspaper-sponsored tournaments had to find another time. From 1930, I started to participate in the Oteai event and advanced to 4 dan with the fastest speed, it was harder than now, in order to promote, you have to get 70+ points. Advancing from 4 dan to 5 dan is impossible to achieve if you don't spend at least two years.];B[qd];W[dd];B[pq];W[oc];B[cp];W[qo]C[As to the opening of B1, B3 and B5, the corner-approach of W6 is most often used.]
;B[ep]LB[pe:a]C[B7: Although B7 itself is just fine, but the upper-right corner will come under attack, for Black to make the diagonal extension at 'a' is the steadiest.];W[np]LB[qg:a]C[With the large knight's move of W8, White expects to clamp at 'a' in the upper right corner, it is also a common tactic.];B[nq]LB[po:a]C[B9: Black elects not to play the joseki by pressing at 'a', since Black is not willing to make the situation complicated.];W[op];B[oq];W[mp];B[lq];W[qg]C[The clamp of W14 is inevitable.]
;B[pe];W[og]C[W16: White is very happy.];B[nd]LB[ne:a]C[The knight's move of B17 is a common play to prevent White from sealing off at 'a'.];W[nc];B[ld]LB[md:a][mc:b][kc:c]C[The jump of B19 is a good move, if Black continues to extend at 'a', then W 'b', B19 and W 'c', this way White not only gains territory and Black also comes under attack, Black can't tolerate.
];W[qc]LB[mc:a][ne:b][kc:c]C[W20: White can also elect to extend at 'a', next B 'b' and W 'c'.]
;B[ph]C[B21 is inevitable.];W[pg];B[rc];W[rb];B[pc];W[od];B[qb];W[oe]C[With the sequence from B23 to W28, an exchange has resulted, the gain and loss from both sides is about equal.];B[nf]C[With the peep of B29, Black want s to make White form an inefficient shape.];W[me]C[W30: White counter-peeps, White's plan fails.];B[of]
;W[pf];B[ng]C[B31 and B33 are also inevitable in this situation.];W[oh]LB[nh:a]C[W34 is a slow move, White should hane at 'a'.];B[ne]LB[md:a]C[Because W34 is weak, after Black connects with B35, White can't cut at 'a'.
];W[pb]LB[ob:a][nb:b][pa:c][md:d]C[W36 is a clever move. If B 'a', then W 'b', B 'c' and W 'd', Black is clearly no good.]
;B[pa]C[The hane of B37 is the right move.];W[nb]LB[pd:a][ob:b][qe:c]C[W38: If White squeezes at 'a', then B 'b' and W 'c', Black would be contained inside.];B[md];W[pd];B[ob];W[qe]C[Through W42, the result is slightly to Black's advantage.];B[lp]LB[ko:a]C[B43 is the vital point, if White gets to make the knight's move at ''a', the difference is very big.]
;W[lo];B[ko];W[kn]C[The double-hane of W46 is strong and correct.];B[ln];W[mo];B[jo];W[jn];B[io]LB[mi:a][in:b]C[Through B51, 'a' and 'b' are miai, Black will get one for sure.];W[mi];B[id]
;W[cj]C[W54 is the last big point on the board.];B[cl]LB[in:a]C[B55 is questionable, Black should first turn at 'a', White can't take tenuki, then Black plays B55.];W[gd];B[in];W[jl]LB[lm:a]C[W58 is strong and unyielding, playing at 'a' is weak.
];B[kl]C[B59: Black has no choice but to fight.];W[jm];B[kj];W[kh]C[W62: White takes a big risk, if White can't separate Black, then Black would have a chance of winning.]
;B[jk];W[hl]C[W64 continues to carry out the plan of W62.];B[lm];W[gk]C[W66 is a good move to cut Black's connection.];B[hj];W[ig]C[Through W68, Black already has no hope to connect together.];B[nm];W[pl];B[mj];W[li]C[Black settles with B69 and B71 in sente, then ...];B[lb]C[The defense of B73 is imperative.]
;W[cq]C[W74: White probes Black.];B[gj]C[B75: Black ignores W74, it is a good move. First, Black wants to settle down himself in the center completely, second, Black also aims to attack White's six stones in the center.];W[dp]C[W76 is inevitable.];B[do];W[dq];B[eq];W[co];B[cn];W[bp];B[ek]C[The sequence through B83 is inevitable.];W[er]
;B[fr];W[fq];B[fp]LB[dr:a]C[W84 and W86 are good order, first exchanging with B87, later on White can connect at 'a' in sente.];W[dn];B[eo];W[cm];B[em];W[en];B[fn];W[dm];B[bm];W[bn]
;B[dl];W[cn];B[fm]C[Through B99, it forms another exchange, the game is already to Black's advantage.];W[kc]C[W100: White puts up the last resistance.];B[jc]LB[mb:a][ic:b]C[B101: If Black wants to crossover by playing at 'a', then White will attach at 'b'.];W[kb];B[mb];W[kd];B[ke];W[jb]
;B[hc]LB[je:a]C[B107: If Black extends at 'a', then White will crossover at 'a' successfully.
