Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[pd]C[In this game, Ye Gui's victory is alarmingly dangerous, in fact she could simply win this game very early on.];W[dd];B[qp];W[dp];B[fq]
;W[hq];B[oq];W[qj];B[cq];W[dq];B[cp];W[do];B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[eq];B[cn]C[The opening is very similar to that of the game 3 between Ye Gui and Umezawa Yukari, only Ye Gui took Black in that game.];W[nc]
;B[qf];W[qm];B[pb];W[kc];B[cf];W[fc];B[bd];W[cc];B[dh];W[mq]LB[kq:a]C[W28: White can also consider to make the two-space extension at 'a'.];B[fo];W[fr]
;B[dn];W[cj];B[ci];W[ej];B[fi];W[gk]LB[fj:a][gi:b][en:c][em:d][fm:e]C[The knight's move of W36 appears light and nimble, but in fact it is no better than the crude pressing at 'a', next B 'b', W 'c', B 'd' and W 'e', this way White separates Black's one stone (B29) on the outside, White would be better off, comparing to the real game in which White one side alone has to escape.];B[fm];W[jp]
;B[ic];W[je]LB[ke:a]C[W40: For White to jump at 'a' is the original move.];B[gd];W[fd];B[gf];W[hb];B[hc];W[ib];B[jc];W[jb];B[kd];W[lc]LB[il:a]C[In the game, through W50, although White obtains some territory, but Black takes sente and makes herself thicker, then plays the knight's move at 'a', starting to attack White, White sinks into a bitter battle.]
;B[il];W[ei]C[The push of W52 is a crude move, White should simply attach at 'a'.]LB[gi:a];B[eh];W[gi];B[fh];W[gm];B[hm]LB[gn:a][fl:b][fj:c][gl:d]C[B57 is a bad move, Black should hang at 'a', if White extends at 57, then Black can extend at 'b', making a miai of two cutting points: the push at 'c' and at 'd', Black must get to play one, Black would be clearly favorable.]
;W[gn];B[gl];W[hk];B[hl];W[jj];B[jk];W[ii];B[kj];W[ki];B[li]LB[ik:a][kh:b]C[B65 and B67 again are bad moves, After White fixes the shape at 'a' in sente, White gets to extend at 'b', this equals to helping the opponent make life. B65 should be reserved, later on even if Black has to play here, Black should play at 'a', which is just the vital point!];W[ik]
;B[kk];W[kh];B[lq];W[lp];B[kq]LB[mr:a]C[B73: Black should play hane at 'a'.];W[mp];B[iq];W[ip];B[hr];W[gr];B[hp];W[gq]
;B[kp];W[ko];B[jq]LB[mr:a][nr:b][ls:c][nq:d][is:e]C[B81 and B83 are obviously miscalculation. After White's hane of W84, Black gets killed by one liberty short. Here Black incurs a big loss, it can be said the game is already over. At any rate, with B81 Black should first hane at 'a', next W 'b', B 'c' and W 'd', then Black can push at 81, followed by W82 and B83, White needs to strengthen outside with one move, Black then makes life by playing at 'e'. This way although Black is no good either, but at least Black can continue the game. In just 30 moves, Black turns into a not bad game into a losing one, it seems Korean women players are not so strong as it is said.];W[lr];B[jo];W[io];B[jn];W[ho]
;B[lo];W[kn];B[rm];W[rn];B[ql];W[pm];B[pl];W[rl];B[rk];W[sm];B[qk];W[km]LB[lh:a]C[But next Ye Gui's play is not very simplistic, with W100, for White to turn at 'a' is bigger.]
;B[lh];W[pq]LB[om:a][rj:b]C[With the attachment of W102, White should extend at 'a', this way W102 and 'b' become miai, White must get one and White wins the game for sure.];B[pr];W[qq];B[pp];W[qr];B[jh];W[jg];B[kg];W[ji];B[ig]
;W[ih];B[if];W[jf];B[lf];W[le]LB[nr:a]C[The sequence from B107 and W116 is a desperate play in an inferior situation. Actually Black should directly play at 'a'.];B[nr];W[rp];B[ro];W[sq];B[mr];W[kr];B[mo]
;W[ir];B[om]C[In the game Black is able to play hane at 125, Black finally connects together.];W[on];B[pn];W[qn];B[nn];W[oo]LB[rj:a]C[The extension of W130 is a bad move! White should clamp over at 'a', Black's territory is clearly inadequate.];B[np];W[jr];B[nl];W[mm]LB[po:a][op:b][qo:c][no:d]C[W134 again is a mistake, White should first take at 'a', next B 'b', W 'c', B 'd' and W134, comparing to the real game where Black captures two white stones at 'a', White's loss is equivalent to the komi.]
;B[po];W[fl]LB[mf:a]C[White ends in gote with W136, it is also small, White should first settle the shape by playing the sente hane move at 'a'.];B[fk];W[el];B[jl];W[fj];B[me]LB[ne:a]C[The hane of B141 is inexplicable! Black certainly should enclose territory by making the knight's move at 'a', this way the situation is already very close.];W[ne];B[nf];W[sk]
;B[sj]C[Black loses common sense with the atari of B145, Black simply can't win the ko.];W[rj];B[sl];W[nm];B[ol];W[sk];B[si];W[rh]LB[ml:a][mk:b][nk:c]C[W152: For White to simply connect the ko is playable, next B152, W 'a', B 'b' and W 'c', Black has to capture White by reducing liberties, White's loss is far more than two points (with the earlier atari of B145 White only takes two-point advantage).];B[sl]
;W[co];B[bo];W[sk];B[rr];W[rs]LB[qo:a][op:b]C[W158 still answering the ko is incomprehensible! White certainly should first atari at 'a', next B 'b', then White can eliminate the ko.];B[sl];W[bn];B[bm];W[sk];B[rq];W[sr]
;B[sl];W[bp]LB[an:a]C[W166: If White descends at 'a', White would have one more ko threat.];B[an];W[sk];B[rq];W[rr]LB[sp:a]C[W170: White certainly should connect at 'a', here White needs one more move.];B[sl];W[mk]LB[qo:a]C[W172: White should find ko threat at 'a'. Ye Gui perhaps feels she has a huge advantage earlier, in the second half, her play is a little chaotic.]
;B[rm];W[lk];B[so]C[In the end, although Black wins the ko, but White's advantage is so big that White still fails to turn the game around.];W[rl];B[qo];W[nj];B[oi];W[ni];B[oh];W[oj];B[pj];W[sp];B[lj]
