Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[pd]C[Both Liu Xing and Cho U are not in good state recently, it is hard to predict who will win this game.];W[dd];B[qp];W[dq];B[cf]
;W[dh];B[dn];W[cl];B[ef];W[fd];B[em]C[The opening is very fresh.];W[ce];B[dk]C[To be creative in 1-hour fast games, it needs a lot of courage and very deep strength.];W[cg]C[W12 and W14: White can connect and has nothing to complain.];B[cq];W[ck]LB[cp:a]C[But the play of W16 is against Go theory. Since White has W14, W8 already becomes light. White certainly should elect to defend the corner at 'a'.]
;B[dp];W[eq];B[gq]C[After B17, with the clamp of B19 Black takes the whole game into consideration.];W[cr];B[br];W[fq];B[gr];W[bq];B[cp];W[bs];B[dr];W[ar];B[er]C[B29: Black sacrifices one more stone, it is common knowledge.]

;B[je];W[kc]C[But White's play of W38, W40 and W42 is really difficult to understand, there is no urgency to defend here now.];B[ec]C[The peep of B43 are early preserved tactic, White is painful.];W[ed];B[fc];W[jb]C[The play of W46 giving away one stone is indeed surprising!];B[kb];W[kd];B[ib];W[jd];B[ic];W[lb]
;B[ja];W[qc];B[qd]C[When White strikes with W54 now, Black certainly will retreat.];W[ob];B[pq];W[no]LB[rc:a][qi:b]C[W58 looks like a play in a favorable situation, but in fact White's situation is already not good. White should play at around 'a' or 'b'.];B[di];W[ci];B[dj];W[cj]
;B[eh]C[From B59 to B63, Black condenses White happily in sente.];W[df];B[pm]C[B65: Then Black comes back to protect his territory. It seems Black already can't lose this game.];W[fj]C[W66 looks like a mistake, but White also has no other good plays.];B[eg];W[rc]LB[pi:a]C[W68 and B 'a' are miai.];B[dg];W[bf];B[ch];W[bh]
;B[pi];W[po];B[op];W[oo];B[qo];W[pp];B[qq];W[oq];B[ol]C[Following W74, White allows Black to enclose territory, it equals to "waiting to die peacefully".];W[hj];B[ko]LB[mp:a]C[B83: Black aims to peep at 'a', it is a positive play.]
;W[lo]C[W84: White loses fighting spirit.];B[pb];W[pc];B[od];W[qb];B[gk];W[gj];B[ne];W[mc];B[kp];W[jq];B[lp];W[lq]
;B[mp];W[np];B[jj]C[When B99, White's situation is already very bad.];W[dl];B[ek];W[il];B[kl];W[og];B[pg];W[oi];B[oj];W[nj];B[oh]
;W[ni];B[nk];W[nh];B[ph];W[jh]C[W104 to W114 are game-deciding moves, but it is already too late.];B[kh];W[kg];B[ki];W[lg];B[ih]C[B119: Black takes advantage by attacking.];W[hh]C[Black wins this match very steadily.];B[ii]C[This game is completely not like "five champion king" Cho U's game.]
