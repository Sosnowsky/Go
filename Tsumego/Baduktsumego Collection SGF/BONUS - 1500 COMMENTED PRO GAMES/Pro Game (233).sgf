;W[nd];B[qf]LB[qc:a]C[B7 is rarely seen, the pro is that Black is relatively thick and White can't attach the corner at 'a', the con is that the speed is slow.];W[lq]C[Because Black plays the jump of B7, the value on the right side becomes small, the direction of W8 is correct.];B[pp];W[po]LB[qq:a][qo:b]C[W10: White can also elect to extend at 'a', then B 'b' and W10, this variation is relatively complicated, in the game it seems Black is not bad.];B[qq];W[rq];B[pq];W[ro]
;B[oo];W[pn];B[rr];W[sr];B[on];W[om]LB[pm:a]C[W20: Normally White will extend at 'a', Black takes sente.];B[pm]C[Black's cut is inevitable.];W[ol];B[qm];W[qr];B[qk]LB[rs:a][qs:b][rn:c][sp:d][sq:e][pr:f][qn:g]TR[pm][qm]C[But the jump of B25 is not good, Black should descend at 'a'! If White still plays the atari at 'b', Black can directly kill White by throwing-in. Therefore, White can only descend at 'c', then B 'd', W 'e', B 'f', because the exchange of B 'd' and W 'e', White can't make the knight's move at 25 and can only connect at 'g'. Black's two stones already becomes light and can take tenuki, this way Black is not bad.]
;W[op];B[np];W[mn]LB[pr:a]C[W26 and W28 are good moves! Because of the exchange of W26 with B27, White's corner is already alive, and also White doesn't need to play the atari at 'a', reserving the usage at the top.];B[lp];W[kp];B[lo];W[kq];B[rs];W[qs];B[qo];W[qn];B[rn]
;W[qo];B[so];W[rp];B[rl];W[ss];B[ln];W[ml];B[sp]LB[oq:a]C[The set pattern of B45 is no good, Black should simply play at 'a'.];W[sq];B[sn];W[pl]LB[pi:a][ri:b]C[W46 and W48 are good order! After these two exchanges, W 'a' is working, Black can only make the knight's move on the second line at 'b'.]

;W[lj];B[jj];W[ed]TR[qk][sp]C[Through W64, because Black's two mistakes (B25 and B45, the marked stones), White is already favorable in the game.];B[cq]C[B65 entering the corner is very big.];W[dq];B[cp];W[co];B[bo];W[bn];B[cn];W[do]
;B[bm];W[dn]C[W74 is correct.];B[an];W[cm];B[cl];W[bn];B[rr];W[rs];B[cn];W[dm];B[gc]C[B83: Black can't strengthen the corner with one more move.];W[bn]
;B[kd];W[lh];B[me];W[pe];B[qe];W[pc];B[qc];W[og]C[The sequence from W88 to W92 is very simple and clear.];B[mg];W[mh];B[dg];W[bp];B[cn]
;W[bq];B[jg]LB[cc:a]C[B99: Black will usually play at 'a'.];W[cc]C[The moving-out of W100 is inevitable.];B[bc];W[dc];B[be];W[gd];B[fc]LB[hd:a][ge:b][gb:c]C[B105: If B105 at 'a', then W105, B 'b' and W 'c', Black comes to nothing.]
;W[de];B[cg];W[hd];B[hc];W[id];B[jb];W[gg];B[ng];W[oh];B[oe]C[With B113 and B115, Black separates White strongly. If Black can't enclose territory in the upper right corner, Black's territory can't compare with White's.];W[ke]LB[ne:a][of:b][nf:c][od:d][qb:e][rb:f][ob:g]TR[jg]C[W116: If White pushes at 'a', then B 'b', W 'c' and B 'd', White can't push out, this is also the purpose of the marked black stone. However, W116 is still questionable, White should first play the hane at 'e', then B 'f' and W 'g', first creating a ko then playing at 116.]
;B[ld];W[jh]LB[kg:a][of:b][im:c][cj:d]C[W118 is the losing move! White should play at 'a', then B 'b' and W 'c', attacking Black's big group. This way although Black encloses territory naturally in the upper right corner, but White can get to invade at 'd' by attacking, White would still be favorable for the game.];B[lg];W[ig];B[kg];W[ji];B[lk];W[mj];B[if]
;W[hg];B[dk]C[In the game, White ends in gote, and Black gets to play at 127, this makes a big difference!
];W[qb];B[ob]C[B129 striking first is a good move!];W[pb];B[rb];W[rh]C[When White attaches with W132, although the aji in the corner is very bad, but Black still can wrap and cross over, White's territory is already inadequate. In the following endgame, White incurs some loss but it already has no impact on the outcome of the game, the difference of 6.5 points is already huge.];B[qh];W[qi];B[rj];W[qg];B[rg]
