Copyright by gogameworld.com and weiqi.tom.com.];B[pd];W[dp];B[fq]C[Black first approaches with B3 to probe White, then decides how to design the opening based on White's response.];W[hq];B[pq]
;W[dd];B[cf];W[fc];B[bd]LB[cn:a][fp:b][cq:c]C[B9: If Black plays double-approach at 'a', White will press at 'b' and B 'c', this is common opening.

B9 is Chang Hao's fond play.];W[cc];B[ci];W[cn]C[W12 is steady move, White can also first approach the lower-right corner.];B[jq]LB[qk:a]C[B13 is positive move, to protect the lower-right corner or play "Chinese Fuseki" at 'a' is all common thinking.]
;W[qf]LB[po:a][pl:b][np:c]C[W14: White has many choices, for example, White can approach the corner at 'a', Black may answer at 'b' or 'c'.];B[qi]LB[qh:a][qn:b]C[The two-space low pincer of B15 is rarely seen nowadays. If Black plays pincer at 'a', White probably will make big-knight approach at 'b' to break up the situation.];W[nc];B[pf];W[pg]LB[qc:a][qe:b][pc:c][po:d]C[W18: If White enters the corner at 'a', then B 'b', W 'c' and B 'd', White's speed is slow and White can't be satisfied.]
;B[of];W[qc];B[qe];W[pc];B[rf];W[qo]C[Following W16, White grabs sente and gets to first approach the lower-right corner, this is wise thinking.];B[pm]LB[qm:a]C[The pincer attack of B25 is inevitable, to pincer at 'a' is also playable. So far, it seems Black takes initiative.];W[qm]LB[qq:a][qr:b][pp:c][oq:d][rq:e][oo:f]C[W26: If Black attaches at 'a', then B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e' and B 'f' sealing off, White is relatively painful.]
;B[ql];W[op]LB[pp:a][po:b][oo:c][oq:d][rp:e][or:f][ro:g][om:h][pl:i][nn:j][pn:k][no:l][on:m][lq:n]C[W26 and W28 are very strange tactic to dodge. If Black pushes at 'a', next W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 'e', W 'f', B 'g', W 'h', B 'i' and W 'j', Black is difficult to handle (see var a). This is the good result in the exchange of W26 and B27.

Moreover, when W 'f', if B 'k', then W 'l', B 'm' and W 'n', White is able to turn body around and can be satisfied (see var b).]

(;B[oq]C[B29 is steady move.];W[np];B[nq];W[pl];B[om];W[rm];B[qk];W[mp];B[mq];W[lp];B[kq]C[Through B39, both sides are roughly acceptable.];W[pj]LB[rq:a][qq:b][mm:c]C[W40: If White makes knight at 'a', Black has good bump at 'b', White is difficult to handle.

W40 in the game is a testing move but a little unreasonable. To cap at 'c' is relatively common.]
;B[pk];W[ol];B[nm];W[ok];B[qj];W[mk]C[W44 and W46: White escapes one lonely group. As to Black, it is very welcome. Black is very thick in surroundings, White in the lower right corner is still not stable.];B[ml]LB[lk:a][oj:b]C[B47 is tight, if White extends at 'a', Black can take advantage at 'b' then stick head out.];W[oj];B[lk];W[lj]
;B[kk]C[Through B51, Black's advantage is obvious.];W[rq]LB[qq:a][rp:b]C[B53: If Black bumps at 'a', White can only retreat at 'b' painfully, but White is still not alive completely.];B[ko]LB[qq:a]C[B53 sealing off White is sente. If White takes tenuki, Black can bump at 'a' and capture four stones in sente.];W[qr]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.];B[li];W[mj];B[kj]LB[fo:a]C[B55 and B57: Black starts to attack White, for Black to jump at 'a' is also very simple and clear.]
;W[ng];B[md];W[mc];B[mi];W[ni];B[pi]C[B61 and B63 are good moves to condense White's shape.];W[mh]C[W64: White is very painful.];B[nj];W[nk];B[oi]C[Being ataried by B65 and B67 into a big pie already can't be avoided.];W[me]C[W68: If White connects right away, White is too heavy, so White elects to sacrifice nine stones.]
;B[nl]C[B69: So far, Black gains a lot by attacking.];W[fp];B[dq]LB[eq:a]TR[hq]C[B71 is better than making extension at 'a'. If B 'a', then White will block at 71 and give up the marked stone.];W[eq];B[er];W[ep];B[cr];W[cq];B[dr];W[bq]
;B[gq];W[gp];B[hr]C[Through B81, the local variation comes to an end. The situation is still to Black's advantage.];W[lh];B[ki];W[jg]C[W82 and W84: White expands at maximum limit, which is must-have attitude in an unfavorable situation.];B[kd];W[nd];B[gc]C[The invasion of B87 is common tactic, White is not easy to kill Black.];W[gd];B[hc];W[fb]
;B[if]LB[ck:a][cj:b][dk:c][pp:d]C[B91 is good move, B87 and B89 can be sacrificed.

If White makes two-space extension at 'a', next B 'b' and W 'c', then Black can push and capture four stones at 'd'. Black would still keep the lead in territory.];W[dh];B[ch];W[df]C[W92 and W94: White perhaps wants to kill Black at top and fights for victory, but it is difficult.];B[ig]LB[ce:a]C[B95: For Black to retreat at 'a' is very big and also the strongest answer. B95 in the game is simple and clear choice.];W[ce]C[W96 is big.]
;B[dg]LB[bf:a][ck:b]C[B97: If Black descends at 'a', W 'b', Black can't be satisfied.];W[eg];B[cg];W[be];B[ef];W[ff];B[de];W[ee];B[df];W[fe];B[cl]C[Following B97, Black settles the shape in sente and then grabs two-space extension of B107, this is correct play. So far, Black is a little favorable.]
;W[lq];B[lr];W[kr];B[jr];W[pp];B[hd]C[W112 and B113 are miai good points.];W[kb];B[ge]C[B115 is an asking move.];W[ad];B[fd];W[ed];B[jb]LB[fg:a][gf:b]C[B119 is good move. If Black plays atari at 'a', W 'b', Black looks thin.]
;W[jc]C[The counterattack of W120 is inevitable.];B[kc];W[ib];B[le];W[nf];B[lb];W[ja];B[lc]C[Through B127, Black gains some profit.];W[mb];B[la];W[gb];B[rd]TR[jb]C[B131: Black makes diagonal in sente, this is the good result from B119 (the marked place).]
;W[rc];B[mf];W[ld];B[hb];W[ha];B[md];W[ne];B[kg]C[B139 is thick. So far, Black's small victory has already been decided.];W[bk]LB[cm:a]C[W140: White makes the last-ditch effort. For Black to bump at 'a' is just fine.];B[bl];W[ck]
;B[dk];W[dl];B[ek]C[From B141 to B145, Black sacrifices two stones, this is also very simple and clear.];W[al];B[el]LB[fm:a]C[B147 is better preserved for now. Later on Black can make knight at 'a'.];W[dm];B[bj];W[bm];B[fg];W[gg];B[fh]
;W[he]C[W154 is tesuji, Black perhaps will give up six stones.];B[ie];W[hf];B[gh]C[Through B157, Black's victory already can't be overturned.];W[mr]LB[id:a][jd:b][gm:c]C[W158: If White captures six stones at 'a', after B 'b', Black will make knight at 'c', there will be no big variation on the board. So White elects to reduce the center.];B[ks];W[pr];B[nr];W[hm]

;W[ho];B[rl]C[B177 is the biggest endgame on the board.];W[nh];B[nj];W[sd];B[se];W[ph];B[qg];W[sc]C[W180 and W184 are worth 4 points in counter-sente.];B[br];W[ar];B[iq]C[B187 is also worth 4+ points in counter-sente.]
;W[fk];B[fl];W[gk];B[hp];W[ej];B[ei];W[gn];B[fo];W[go];B[lf];W[bf]TR[jg]C[W198 is bigger then escaping the marked stone.];B[od]

;B[ka]LB[hi:a]C[B213: For Black to play hane at 'a' is relatively simple.];W[hi]C[After W214, the game becomes closer.];B[jb];W[ia];B[ic];W[ga];B[jh];W[or];B[ms];W[bg];B[pn]
;W[qn];B[jd];W[gd];B[io]C[Black wins for sure.];W[oe];B[pe];W[sl];B[sk];W[os];B[fd];W[fi];B[hh];W[gd]
;B[sr];W[sq];B[fd];W[rk];B[rj];W[ii];B[gd];W[gf];B[im];W[il];B[jm]C[B245 and B247 are the biggest endgame. Black is leading about 9 points on the board.];W[lo];B[ln]

;B[in]C[Today it is Chang Hao 9p's good game and complete victory over Lee Changho 9p.

In the opening, W40 is the cause leading to White's passivity. Afterwards Black takes control of the situation till the end and didn't give White any chance.

Chang Hao 9p won Samsung Cup champion.])
