;W[cn];B[nq]LB[kq:a]C[B7: Chang Hao elects to make a large knight's move with B7 rather than play at 'a' to form the very popular "Mini Chinese" fuseki, B7 is a prepared move. Mr. Go Seigen who is watching the game has praised this move.];W[qj]LB[qk:a]C[W8: White's splitting move on the right side is inevitable, but where to play the splitting move is not unique, Mr. Go Seigen points out that a play at 'a' is also a very good move to restrict Black's expansion of influence in the lower right.];B[ql];W[qf];B[nc];W[rd]LB[qc:a][ph:b]C[Now if Black plays at 'a', this will give a chance for White to strengthen at 'b' and develop a good shape, this way Black seems more passive due to Black's large knight's corner enclosure in the lower right corner.]
;B[qh]C[The subsequent fight has almost become a joseki.];W[of];B[pi];W[qc];B[kc];W[hq];B[dr];W[eq];B[er];W[fp];B[cp];W[co];B[bp]
;W[fr]C[W26: Black ataris but now the ladder is to Black's favor, the variation up to here is pre-calculated starting from W20.];B[gq]C[Black pulls out his stone right way with B27 and Black is not willing to give way, a fight thus commences in the lower left.];W[gr];B[gp];W[ep];B[dq];W[br];B[cr];W[ip];B[go];W[en];B[hn]
;W[lq]C[The fight here has simply ended, the scene of a fierce fight didn't appear as high pros in the study room had expected.];B[dj]LB[ek:a][cf:b][ch:c]C[Through 39, the fight over the lower left conrer comes to a temporary close, Chang Hao has used 20 minutes, Lee Changho 70 minutes. Zhang Xuan 8p (Chang Hao's wife) in the study room thinks Chang Hao's play is not bad today, next W 'a' followed by B 'b' is common, but Lee Changho is also likely to play more positively by the checking extension move at 'c'.];W[cf];B[gk];W[dl]LB[fj:a][no:b][jq:c]C[Chen Zude 9p thinks now for Black to connect at 'a' solidly or to secure the corner at 'b' is not bad, in the game, Chang Hao elects to invade at 'c'.];B[jq]
;W[jp];B[kq];W[lp];B[lr];W[mr]LB[iq:a]C[The opinion from the study room is that now Black's sequeezing play at 'a' is good timing, the result is not bad for Black.];B[kr]C[In the game, Chang Hao connected on the second line, Yun Kihyeon 9p, Korean team president, thinks Chang Hao has saved a little only to lose a lot, it is damaging to the lower right corner.];W[es];B[bs];W[mq];B[kp];W[ko]
;B[lo];W[mo]C[After W56, it is time for the noon break.];B[ln];W[jn];B[nr];W[ms]C[Nie Weiping 9p, who is a guest in Xian Go Association, has watched the game online, thinks now Black has no way to conceal White, Black is already fraught with grim possibilities, though Chang Hao's play is very positive, but he seems overhasty.];B[mn];W[no];B[nn];W[oo];B[pn];W[iq]
;B[on];W[mp];B[ns];W[op];B[oq]C[However, from the result, Black though ends in gote, but nevertheless seals off White and Black becomes very thick, Nie 9p thinks Black is acceptable, in the fight following the invasion of B43, Chang Hao is not at a disadvantage.];W[ic]C[White has obtained sente and also grabbed the big extension point.];B[cl]C[Black starts putting pressure on the left white stones, Lee Changho has spent a lot of time over here.];W[dk];B[ck];W[ej];B[di];W[bo]
;B[ek];W[el];B[fk];W[gm];B[hm];W[bi]LB[bh:a]C[W84: This move can also be played as the small knight's move at 'a', the opinion from the study room is that the situation is hard to judge as a whole.];B[bj];W[hl];B[fm];W[fn];B[gn];W[ao]LB[gl:a][bq:b][cc:c]C[The stand of W90 threatens Black's corner, Mr. Go Seigen points out that Black can take at 'a' and sacrifice the corner, after White captures the lower left corner at 'b', Black can take the upper left corner at 'c', it is a simple and clear way and Black is favorable. This quick exchange to settle the game was unanimously admired and respected by high pros in the study room.]
;B[ap]C[Chang Hao continues tightening White's liberties and charges forward bravely, the capturing race is extremely complicated, pros in the study room have showed many variations.];W[aq];B[cq];W[as];B[ar];W[gl];B[fl];W[im];B[dn];W[as];B[fo];W[do];B[ar]
;W[in];B[hr];W[ir];B[em];W[dm];B[cm];W[ho];B[dn];W[eo]C[So far the fight here comes to an end, next Black will enter the upper left, from the result, (to Black) it is far inferior to the scheme that Mr. Go Seigen has suggested.];B[db];W[dc];B[eb];W[cb]
;B[bb];W[cc];B[gc];W[kd];B[jc]C[B121 is brutal.];W[hc];B[gd];W[jd];B[ld];W[le];B[md];W[ob];B[nf]
;W[hf];B[gf];W[gg];B[ff];W[he];B[fg];W[kf];B[ng]C[The fight on the upper side stops temporarily, both sides still need to compromise to resolve the ko fight in the lower left corner.];W[as];B[ca];W[bc];B[ar];W[ph]
;B[qi];W[as];B[kn];W[jo];B[ar]LB[pp:a][jr:b]C[Over here Black is a little careless, Black should first play the ko threat at 'a' followed by W 'b'.];W[jr];B[pp];W[as];B[bg]C[However, Black still have plenty of ko threats.];W[bf]
;B[ar];W[oh];B[oe];W[oi];B[pj];W[qg];B[pb]C[Now Black doesn't want to eliminate the ko, with the aim of settling the shapes by endgame plays under the advantage of abundant ko threats.];W[pc];B[oc];W[as];B[qb];W[rb];B[ar]
;W[pq];B[pr];W[as];B[qd];W[rc];B[ar];W[kb];B[bq]C[B173: Black finally gets rid of the ko, the game becomes very close, pros in the study room have no final and unanimous conclusion (on who will win the game).];W[ch];B[hg];W[ig];B[hh];W[lc]
