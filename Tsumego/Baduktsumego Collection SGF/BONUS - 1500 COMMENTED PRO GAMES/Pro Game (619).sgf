Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[In the first game of the 11th GS Caltex Cup league games, Lee Changho 9p lost to Jo HanSeung 8p by 1.5 points.];W[dd]C[Lee Changho appears not in state for this game.];B[pp];W[dq];B[fc];W[hc]
;B[oc];W[co]LB[cf:a]C[W8: In terms of high efficiency, to play at 'a' is better, if Black approaches the corner, White can pincer-attack.];B[cc]C[B9: Black is happy to strike the corner.];W[dc];B[cd];W[de];B[db];W[eb];B[cb];W[ec];B[cf]
;W[nq];B[qn];W[pr];B[jc];W[ch];B[cg];W[dh];B[mq]C[B21 and B25 are contradictory, if Black plans to attach with B25, Black shouldn't exchange B21 and W22. Generally speaking, when the left side is White's stones, the play of B25 is not to Black's advantage.];W[mp];B[lq];W[nr]LB[lp:a]C[The play of W28 is correct, here White must fight with Black, if White plays at 'a' by joseki, Black will play hane at 28, this just is Black's wish.]
;B[lp];W[qq];B[np];W[mo];B[lo];W[no];B[qk]LB[op:a][pm:b]C[B35: If Black connects at 'a', White's shoulder-hit at 'b' is annoying.];W[op]C[But White takes and connects together with W36, Black also clearly incurs loss.];B[hp];W[qi]
;B[qg];W[pm]LB[qm:a][pk:b]C[W40 is a good move. If B41 at 'a', White will seal off at 'b', since White at the bottom is very thick, Black is not comfortable this way.];B[pj]C[Black counterattacks with B41!];W[rl]C[But White gets to capture with W42, it is very substantial! Black is clearly not favorable for the whole game. In just about forty moves, Black already shows a losing trend.];B[rk];W[qm];B[oh];W[nc]LB[je:a][fq:b]C[White's sequence following W46 is too superficial, although White is thick, White ends in gote, for White to cap at 'a' is better, preventing Black from grabbing the big point at 'b'.]

;W[gb];B[fq];W[eo];B[cn]C[B63: Black dives in strongly, it is a game-deciding move.];W[dn];B[cm];W[bo];B[dm];W[fl]C[Following W68, White takes advantage by attacking.];B[en];W[do];B[fm]
;W[el];B[em];W[go];B[ho];W[gn];B[gm];W[hn];B[gl];W[gj];B[fk];W[fj];B[ej]C[Black cleverly dodges himself with B81 and B83, Lee Changho starts to exert power, but the regrettable thing is the board already becomes smaller, the difference between both sides is smaller and smaller, but Black is difficult to catch up.];W[ei]
;B[dj];W[gk];B[ek];W[bj];B[bk];W[bh];B[cj];W[nh]C[W92: White plays by borrowing strength, with just few moves, White forms a moyo in the center.];B[ng];W[mg];B[nf];W[lf];B[ki]
;W[ni];B[kk]C[B97 and B99: Black dives in again, for White to kill strongly is too risky.];W[km];B[il];W[jp]C[W98 and W102: White still elects to take advantage by eyeing from afar, it is a clever play.];B[jq];W[gp];B[hq];W[er];B[in];W[gq];B[gr]
;W[fr];B[ih]C[B111: It seems Black gains a lot by completely destroying White's moyo, but Black's step is too big, White's weakness in the shape can be avoidable.];W[ij];B[gh];W[fh];B[lh];W[ok]C[W116 is the vital point for the shape.];B[gg];W[kg];B[ji];W[ff];B[kn]LB[pi:a]C[Although B121 is the original move, but it is the losing move of the game.

Black should strengthen at 'a', betting on the life-and-death in the center, although Black may lose badly, but  Black can win the game if White can't take any advantage.]
;W[rj]C[W122 shows the sword, piercing through Black's territory, White starts to take the lead in territory.];B[sk];W[pi]C[Waiting for chances in the endgame is Lee Changho's style, but just because of this, Lee Changho loses this game.];B[oj];W[oi];B[nj];W[mh];B[nm];W[om];B[mn];W[ml];B[nl]
