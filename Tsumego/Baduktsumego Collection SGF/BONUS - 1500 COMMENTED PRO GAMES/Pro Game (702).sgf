Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[pd]C[The dual meet between Chinese and Korean team champions is a new event, after the regular games, they tied at 2:2, this is the extra fast game between two main players.];W[dd];B[pq];W[cp];B[eq]
;W[qo];B[pl];W[lp];B[po];W[iq]C[The opening from B1 to W10 was popular in the past.];B[cf];W[dh];B[ef];W[fd];B[dk]C[The sequence from B11 to B15 is Chang Hao's favorite.];W[ce];B[bf]
;W[dq];B[ep];W[dn]LB[cn:a]C[W20: For White to make one-space extension at 'a' is steady.];B[hp]LB[co:a]C[B21: Black aims to attach down at 'a'.];W[ip];B[io];W[ho]LB[en:a][hq:b]C[The cut of W24 just helps Black to attach at 'a' to seek tempo, White can consider to simply turn at 'b'.]
;B[en];W[gp];B[dm];W[cn];B[hn];W[hq];B[cm];W[gn];B[gm];W[hm];B[gl]C[Through B35, although White is thick, but White is already not easy to escape W12, overall Black can be satisfied.];W[qp];B[qq]C[B37 is the right move.]
;W[gf]C[Following W38, White takes tenuki and is alert, here White can't end in gote.];B[do];W[co];B[ec]C[B41 is the right sequence.];W[ed];B[fg];W[gg];B[fh];W[gh];B[fi];W[nc]C[After White approaches with W48, the outcome of the game is subject to how much territory White can enclose at the top.];B[qf]
;W[ne];B[pb];W[hc]LB[jc:a]C[W50 and W52 are weird. With W50 or W52, White all should make extension at 'a', this is just the right move.

In the real game, after W52, Black is left with the tactic of striking the corner.];B[lc]C[However after the invasion of B53, White's territory again is questionable.];W[pe];B[qe];W[od]C[W54 and W56 are damaging.];B[pc];W[lf];B[ic];W[ib]LB[hb:a]C[W60: White should simply descend at 'a'.]
;B[hd];W[hb];B[jf]C[After B61 and B63, Black runs out smoothly, Black is favorable for the game.];W[jc];B[jh]LB[jd:a][pp:b]C[With B65, Black clearly has favorable consciousness. With B65 Black should directly play at 'a' to tangle with White, or simply take tenuki and connect at 'b'.];W[pm];B[ql];W[pp];B[op];W[oo]
;B[np]LB[nq:a]C[Moreover, with B71 Black should hang at 'a' to obtain sente.];W[no];B[nr];W[lh];B[jj]LB[jd:a]C[B75: Black still should play at 'a'.];W[bm]C[The hane of W76 is huge.];B[bl];W[bn]LB[bk:a]C[And White is still left with the clamp at 'a'.]
;B[jd];W[ke];B[ie];W[gd];B[kd]LB[fn:a][bd:b][og:c][jb:d][nb:e]C[B83 is too small! At any rate Black should hit at 'a' or jump in at 'b', or make the knight's move at 'c'.

Besides, with B83, Black also should consider to cut and atari at 'd', at the top B53 is very light since Black can attach at 'e'.];W[lj];B[og];W[oi]
;B[nl];W[ig];B[jg];W[ll];B[mo];W[mn];B[mp];W[om];B[nn];W[nm];B[qi];W[bk]C[Following W98, it enters into complicated endgame fight.];B[in]

;B[pi];W[lo];B[kk];W[lk];B[il];W[be]C[Again White blocks with W118, Black clearly incurs loss, later on Black perhaps still has some winning chances, but in fast game, the luck factor is biased to White.];B[kn];W[ln];B[cj];W[bj];B[ci];W[bi];B[ch]
