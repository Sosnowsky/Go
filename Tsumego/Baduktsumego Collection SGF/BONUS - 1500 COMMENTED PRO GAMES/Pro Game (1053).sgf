Gueon Hyojin still plays her usual opening.];B[qn]
;W[nq];B[rp];W[qf];B[qh];W[qq];B[pf];W[cf];B[fd];W[di];B[qe];W[eq]LB[om:a][pl:b][ol:c][pk:d][ip:e][on:f]C[The corner-protecting move of W16 shows her solid style, but at that time I was worried about W 'a', Black answers at 'b', next W 'c', B 'd' and W 'e', this way White's opening is smooth. Therefore, looking back, the tiger's move of B15 is slow, Black should jump up at 'f'.]
;B[on]C[When I plays the jump of B17, I feel not bad.];W[kc];B[ic];W[nc];B[oc];W[nd];B[nf]C[I spent a lot of time thinking with the cap of B23, because there are still a lot of big points on the board, it is a decisive moment, what kind of building you are going to construct, you must have a plan at this time. With B23, B25 and B27, Black already has made a complete expansion plan.];W[ke];B[kg]C[But the play of B25 is damaging in the first place, with W26, White becomes very thick.];W[ie];B[lm];W[lk]LB[nk:a]C[W28 is inevitable before Black seals off, B29 is a move I regretted after the game, enclosing at 'a' is already good enough, W28 would always be a burden for White.]
;B[jk]LB[kl:a][nk:b]C[B29: Black expects White to escape at 'a', then Black encloses at 'b', this way White would be heavy, However White invades deeply into Black's moyo with W30, I totally didn't expect.];W[qi]C[The play of W30 shows Gueon Hyojin's self-confidence, in this crucial moment she plays very bravely, and it also shows her tremendous strength on the back of her solid style. How Black to deal with this white stone? Confused!];B[pi];W[qj]LB[pj:a][rh:b][qk:c][rk:d][rg:e][ri:f][qg:g]C[B31 and B33 appears in disorder, now Black couldn't capture White, therefore how to allow White make the smallest life should be the right thinking. With the sequence from B 'a' to  'g', White makes life at the bottom, this can be accepted by Black, since Black's outside becomes much thicker, this way it would be still a prolonged game.]
;B[ql];W[rh];B[qg];W[pj];B[ok];W[ph];B[oi]C[When White ataris with W38, Black already can't capture White, Black should think about how to reduce his loss to a minimum.];W[oj];B[nj];W[ni];B[oh];W[nk];B[mj]
;W[nl];B[mk];W[pl];B[pm];W[ml];B[ll];W[pk];B[rg]LB[rk:a]C[B53: Black is not happy to settle the shape by playing the diagonal at 'a', because if White ataris at 53, it will be a two-point difference, but due to this two-point struggle, now Black seems more unreasonable, accelerating Black's defeat.];W[nn]LB[mn:a]C[White counterattacks with W54, White becomes more valiant with the fight. Now Black can only make the diagonal extension at 'a', the play in the game is really unreasonable.];B[nm]
