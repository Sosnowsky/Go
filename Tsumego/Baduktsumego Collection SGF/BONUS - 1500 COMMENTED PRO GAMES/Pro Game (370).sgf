Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd];W[dc]C[As to the opening of B1, Hane Naoki always answers with W2.];B[pq];W[dp];B[de]
;W[od];B[fd];W[qc];B[eb]LB[kc:a][be:b][pd:c][qe:d][rc:e][kd:f]C[White can play the sequence from W 'a' to W 'e' and is very happy, so with B9 Black can consider to play at 'f' instead.];W[kc];B[be];W[pd]
;B[qe];W[rc];B[qh];W[qn]LB[qj:a]C[W16: To be more positive, White can also play at 'a'.];B[qk];W[qq]C[W16 and W18: White breaks up the situation and it becomes a close game, which Hane likes and is also very good at.];B[qp];W[pp];B[rq];W[qr];B[po]
;W[op];B[qo];W[rr];B[mp];W[oo]LB[no:a]C[W28 is variation, the joseki is to make diagonal at 'a'.];B[pn];W[on];B[pm];W[jp]C[White gets to pincer-attack with W32, White's speed is very fast.];B[ln]LB[mn:a]C[The shape of B33 is not right, to jump at 'a' is common.]
;W[cn]C[White gets to defend the corner first with W34, White already breaks up the situation.];B[hq];W[kq];B[er];W[fq]LB[dq:a]C[W38: for White to simply play at 'a' is good enough.];B[fr];W[gq]C[W38 and W40 are Hane Naoki's unique play, this set pattern is thick, but it is point-damaging.];B[gr];W[hp];B[dq];W[cq]
;B[iq];W[ip];B[ep];W[eq];B[dr];W[fo]LB[eo:a][cp:b]C[W50 is good move! If W 'a', then B 'b', White is clearly not good.];B[cp];W[do];B[dj]LB[om:a]C[B53: If Black turns at 'a', Black can seal off White and connect two stones, it is a very thick move.]
;W[om]C[W54: White presses out, White's tempo is very good.];B[ll];W[bp];B[cr];W[bq];B[jr];W[gb];B[ec];W[hd]LB[kd:a][ic:b]C[W62: White perhaps overlooks Black's serial good moves following B 'a', otherwise White will play at 'b', not giving Black any strength to borrow.];B[kd]
;W[lc];B[id];W[hc];B[he];W[fi];B[dh];W[ge];B[hf];W[gd]C[W70 and W72 are not big places.];B[ld]C[Especially when Black presses with B73 in sente, White is painful.];W[mc];B[cl]LB[ki:a]C[B75: Black grabs territory greedily, to connect at 'a' is thick and relatively normal.]
;W[kj]C[White gets to first pound with W76, so far Black is leading in territory, but Black is thin and must pay some price.];B[ij];W[ih];B[kh];W[mj];B[ji];W[jl];B[lr];W[kr];B[nr];W[oq];B[or];W[pr]
;B[ks];W[lp];B[il];W[im];B[ik];W[ok];B[kk];W[qj]C[W94 and W96: White destroys Black's territory, White's attack is effective.];B[rj];W[rk];B[rl];W[ri];B[sk]
;W[qi];B[rh];W[sh];B[oh];W[oi];B[nh];W[lh]LB[li:a]C[The cut of W108 is severe, since W 'a' is sente, Black can't connect with the upper-right corner.];B[jm];W[mh];B[nf];W[me];B[mf]

;B[og];W[qg];B[rg]C[Through B129, Black makes life and Black didn't lose any points, but White's outside becomes thick, Black's stones at the top become thin, Black pays a dear price.];W[fe]C[Now Black is still leading in territory, but White can destroy Black's territory on the left side to achieve balance. So White is easy to play.];B[hh]LB[ee:a]C[B131: Perhaps Black should first defend the corner at 'a', Black can fight.];W[hi];B[gh];W[dd];B[ed];W[ee];B[db]
;W[dg]C[Black's side territory is being pierced through easily by W134 and W138, Black is not good.];B[df];W[eg];B[gi];W[ch];B[fj];W[di]C[W142 and W144 are crude moves.];B[cj];W[rd];B[pe];W[bf]LB[cg:a]C[After W148, the corner has some endgame tactic, but White ends in gote and incurs loss first, for White to play at 'a' is better.]
;B[cf];W[bg];B[nd];W[nc];B[ni];W[nj];B[pk];W[oj];B[jf]C[B157 is big, now the situation is very close.];W[bd];B[ad];W[ei];B[fl]

;W[dl];B[dm];W[bl];B[ck];W[fn];B[fm];W[gm];B[ej]C[Through B181, Black forms territory in the center, White incurs loss.];W[jq];B[ir];W[bi]C[Now if there is no loop hole in the upper-left corner, Black should be favorable.];B[bk]
;W[ac]C[But Hane Naoki has the clever endgame tactic following W186.];B[ae];W[cc];B[ce];W[cb];B[bb];W[ba];B[ab];W[fb];B[bc];W[ea];B[cd];W[da]
;B[ca];W[cb]C[After W200, White achieves a slight advantage.];B[jc];W[jb]C[In the end, Hane Naoki plays very steadily and wins by half point only, but Teacher Cho can do nothing about it.];B[br];W[al];B[cc];W[ic];B[jd];W[sq];B[sp];W[fp]
