;B[cb]C[Black's selection of a big joseki with the sequence from B9 to B19 seems questionable.];W[df];B[dg];W[cf];B[cg];W[be];B[ce];W[bf];B[bg];W[bd];B[cd];W[eg]C[After White cuts with W30, although the star stone of B5 is relatively ideal, White can't find an effective way to play a ladder breaker, but Black's small points at the top and bottom are in a very good position, White can exert pressure on Black by using Black's weakness of the ladder breaker.]
;B[bi];W[ci];B[bh];W[pe];B[qe];W[pf];B[qg];W[pg];B[qh];W[ph]C[The sequence from W34 to W40 is a mock attack.];B[fg]LB[pi:a][qi:b]C[B41: Usually Black will play the hane at 'a', but now White will definitely cut at 'b'. Because Black is always worried that White will play the ladder breaker at 41, affecting the fight on the right side, so Black has to tenuki to eliminate this time bomb on the left side.]
;W[eh];B[fh];W[qi]LB[qf:a][rf:b][ri:c][qj:d][re:e][rg:f][rd:g][qc:h][rc:i][rb:j][qb:k][pb:l][qa:m][pa:n][pc:o][ra:p][qn:q]C[The simple hane of W44 is a feeling of a professional player, but now it is not a proper move. White should directly push at 'a', Black blocks at 'b', then White hanes at 44 to probe Black. If Black hanes at 'c', White then takes the opportunity to extend at 'd', expanding his moyo at the top and also ruining Black's potential on the right side. Moreover, later on Black invades into White's moyo at the top, if White wants to kill, White can play the sequence of W 'e', B 'f', W 'g', B 'h', W 'i', B 'j', W 'k', B 'l', W 'm', B 'n', W 'o', B 'p' and W 'k' to kill without a break; If White doesn't need to kill, White can also attack at 'h' as an endgame play, this way White's shape is resilient. Besides, if White pushes at 'a', B 'b', W 44 and B 'h', then White can descend at 'c' in sente then approach at 'q', building a new framework on the right side.

;B[qf]LB[pi:a]C[The simple connection of B45 is a good move, not allowing White to borrow strength and also aiming at the cut at 'a'.];W[pi]C[White has to reinforce himself with W46 and is very painful.];B[pb];W[nq]LB[qn:a]C[W48: Because of the stone of W46, White can't approach the corner at 'a' to build a territory.];B[qn];W[qq];B[pq];W[pr];B[or]
;W[rr];B[oq];W[np];B[qp];W[rp];B[ro];W[ob];B[jd]LB[je:a][jc:b][jg:c]C[B61 is an overplay. The right side is White's thick wall, the lonely deep invasion of B61 is obviously unreasonable. In fact, Black only needs to play at 'a', W 'b' and Black can jump to 'c', this way Black can be satisfied.];W[jf]C[W62 is the right move, Black instantly sinks into a bitter battle.]
;B[hc];W[jb]LB[kb:a]C[However, the ensuing move of W64 is overzealous. Actually it is already adequate for White to press at 'a'. Only if Black can't make two eyes locally, then Black has to escape inside White's thick wall and Black has no future.];B[kb]C[B65 is a good move.];W[hb]LB[kc:a][jc:b][ib:c][kf:d]C[W66: If Black plays the hane at 'a', then after Black cuts at 'b', Black will have eye space; If White tries to destroy eyes at 'c', Black can play the good move of the attachment at 'd'. Because White has the weakness of Black's block at 66, White always can't play this way.];B[if];W[ie];B[ib]LB[ic:a][id:b]C[B69 is again a tenuji. White can't kill Black by playing at 'a', otherwise after Black plays the counter-atari at 'b', White couldn't look after both the upper and lower sides.]
;W[ia];B[ic];W[gb];B[jc];W[lc];B[ld]LB[lb:a]C[B75 is a greedy move, Black should crawl at 'a' to make life.];W[mc];B[ja];W[je]LB[fi:a][hg:b][hf:c][kc:d][kd:e][ha:f][jg:g]C[W78 is a very bad move! White should first play the hane at 'a', if Black still makes the diagonal's extension at 'b', White can atari at 'c', this way Black's group on the upper side would be very dangerous! after asking why Chang Hao plays W78, he said he mistakenly thought that if White squeezes at 'd', Black can connect at 'e' and can only take at 'f', otherwise White can kill Black as in the real game. But he neglected Black's good move of cut and atari at 'g'! Otherwise he definitely would hane at 'a' and atari at 'c'.]

;W[la];B[lf];W[lg];B[mg];W[me];B[jg];W[hf]LB[le:a][ih:b]C[W98 is the last losing move. White still should push at 'a', B 'b' and W98 to kill Black. Although White is not happy to allow Black to make a ponnuki at 'b', but White would have killed Black at the top, the road to victory or defeat is still very far.];B[kf];W[ih];B[ii];W[hi]
