Translation:GoGameWorld.];B[qd]C[In the first two games of the 16th Chinese Mingren Title final, the challenger Qiu Jun 6p played marvelously and won two games in a rows, forcing the defending champion Zhou Heyang 9p to a blind alley. Here let's look at the game 2.];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[fc]
;W[cf];B[kc];W[qk];B[qi];W[qo];B[np]LB[qn:a][qf:b][qm:c]C[B9 and B11 are rarely seen, with B9 Black normally will make the large knight's corner enclosure at 'a', then White makes two space extension and Black jumps to 'b', with B11 for Black to invade at 'c' is more common.];W[ok];B[oi];W[lq]C[In the game, when White directly forces with W14, Black is a little difficult.]
;B[pl]LB[qp:a][po:b][nq:c]C[B15: If Black only plays the diagonal's extension at 'a', then W 'b' and B 'c', Black can't be satisfied.];W[pk];B[ql]C[The play of B15 and B17 is an attitude of seeking a fight.]
(;W[rk]LB[pn:a][qq:b][qr:c][pp:d][rq:e][oq:f][qp:g][pr:h][op:i][po:j][oo:k][on:l]C[The descent of W18 is a slow move! After Black  jumps to 'a', White can only crawl on the second line, White as a whole is not alive, so White clearly has incurred some loss. White should attach underneath at 'b', then B 'c', W 'd', B 'e', W 'f', B 'g', W 'h', B 'b', W 'i', B 'j', W 'k', B 'a' and W 'l', this way is clearly better than the real game (see var a).];B[pn]
;W[rm];B[po];W[qp];B[qq];W[mk];B[ip];W[mp]LB[lo:a][kp:b][lp:c][lm:d]C[W26: If White simply jumps to 'a', then after the exchange of B 'b' and W 'c', Black will cap at 'd', White will be separated into two groups and the fight is not to White's advantage.];B[mo];W[lo]
;B[kp]LB[nq:a][mn:b]C[B27 and B29 are good moves! If standing at 'a', White will jump to 'b' to connect, this would just fit to White's plan.];W[lp];B[mn]TR[lo]LB[mm:a][nl:b][nk:c]C[But the extension of B31 is too heavy! Because Black already takes advantage with B29, the marked white stone becomes light, with B31 Black should jump to 'a' and can stick his head out without conducting the exchange of B 'b' and W 'c'.
];W[ln]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.];B[nl];W[nk]LB[mi:a]C[The exchange of B33 and W34 is too damaging to Black! After the exchange, White can jump to 'a' without any apprehension.]
;B[lm];W[km];B[ll];W[mi];B[ng];W[kj]C[Through W40, both sides come back to the same starting point.];B[fq];W[ir];B[cn];W[dn];B[dm];W[en];B[cq]
;W[co];B[dq];W[cm];B[nq];W[hp];B[kl];W[jm];B[jl];W[hq];B[gr];W[qg];B[ph]TR[qg]LB[qh:a][ri:b]C[B59 is not that tight, Black should hit at 'a', this can reduce White's liberties and only make the marked white stone heavy. In the game, White can sacrifice the marked white stone, White still has eye shape by playing at 'b'.]
;W[pd];B[pc]LB[pe:a]C[B61: Because of this, Black has no state of mind to play the hane at 'a'.];W[qe];B[pe];W[od];B[qf];W[re];B[rd];W[rf];B[oe];W[qc];B[rc]
;W[qb];B[rb];W[pb];B[oc];W[nd];B[ob];W[nb];B[qa];W[nc];B[pa];W[of];B[ne];W[nf]
;B[me];W[og];B[mf];W[nh];B[mg];W[oh]C[But through the exchange up to W90, White still achieves a big profit.];B[db];W[gd]LB[ld:a]C[The diagonal's extension of W92 is an absolutely good point! Because Black is left with the aji of pulling out at 'a', here Black can't attack White strongly.];B[fd];W[gc];B[fb]
;W[ge];B[cc];W[fe];B[cg];W[df];B[ci];W[bg];B[bh];W[dg]LB[bp:a][bq:b][bn:c]C[W102 and W104: But White forgets a very important order. Before these two moves, White should first make the exchange of W 'a' and B 'b', this way Black's descent at 'c' is not longer working, White is no bad.];B[bn]LB[bo:a][bm:b]C[The timing of B105 is excellent! If White blocks at 'a', Black can atari at 'b' to make life easily. White is reluctant to let Black live like this, but White will lose a lot of points, White has paid a price for not being rigid.¡£]
;W[dl];B[bo];W[bm];B[dh];W[fk]LB[dj:a]TR[ci][bh][dh]C[The knight's move of W110 is too slow! White should jump to 'a', this will also strengthen himself but will put a tremendous pressure on the marked black stones!];B[fh];W[ch];B[dj]C[The tiger's move of B113 is the vital point, White has no good way to attack Black.];W[hh]
;B[cg];W[ld];B[kd];W[le];B[kf];W[ch];B[im]LB[ke:a]C[B121: Black can consider to connect at 'a'.];W[in];B[cg];W[ke];B[je];W[lc]
;B[jg];W[kb];B[jb];W[if]LB[mb:a]C[W130: If White immediately makes the ko at 'a', White has no proper ko threats.];B[mh];W[ni];B[lb];W[ch];B[hn]LB[jf:a]C[B135: Black still should connect at 'a'.];W[il]
;B[hm];W[io];B[cg];W[bd]LB[jf:a]C[W140 is inexplicable! White certainly should cut at 'a', this way the game is still very complicated.];B[jf]C[In the game, after Black connects with B141, Black takes advantage that almost equals to one move.
