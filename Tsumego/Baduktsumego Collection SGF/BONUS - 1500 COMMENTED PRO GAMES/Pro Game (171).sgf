Translation:GoGameWorld.];B[qd]C[From Mar. 2nd to Mar. 5th, Choi Cheolhan 7p defeated Lee Changho 9p twice a row in Guksu and Kisung title matches. Within three days, Lee Changho lost two games to Choi Cheolhan, certainly it shows Choi Cheolhan was a very tough opponent, but from contents of the games, it is hard to believe that these games were played by cool-headed and calm Lee Changho. Some people said it was because Yoo Changhyeok's wife suddenly passed away, disrupting Lee Changho's original steady heart and causing him to lose his normal sense. ];W[dd]C[This game is extremely chaotic, the variations are very complex, here we only discuss some important points due to the limitation of this article.];B[pq];W[oc];B[md]
;W[qo];B[pm];W[oe];B[pf];W[oh];B[og]LB[of:a]C[B11: In terms of joseki, Black should play at 'a', the play in the game shows Choi Cheolhan's strong desire for fights.];W[ph];B[ng];W[qc];B[rc];W[pd];B[qe]
;W[on];B[op];W[om];B[pl];W[ol];B[pk];W[pn];B[ok];W[rq]LB[nk:a][nj:b][oj:c]C[W26 is inexplicable, White should play hane at 'a', then B 'b' and W 'c', this variation would be relatively better for White.];B[rn]LB[lq:a]C[B27 is an overplay! Extending at 'a' can be satisfied.]
;W[qm];B[rm];W[qn];B[ql];W[mp];B[mr];W[nq];B[nr];W[lq];B[mq];W[np];B[lp];W[lr]LB[kq:a]C[W40 is hard to understand? ! For White to extend at 'a' is clearly better than the real game.]
;B[oq];W[jq];B[oo];W[mo];B[nn]C[B43 and B45 are good moves by taking advantage of White's tightness in liberties.];W[lo];B[mm];W[nk];B[kp];W[kn];B[ro];W[qp];B[ko]
;W[ln];B[ip];W[iq];B[io];W[ml];B[hq];W[hr];B[gr];W[gq];B[hp];W[fr];B[kq]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.];W[nj]
;B[qi];W[gs];B[kr]C[Through B69, White's two stones are being captured, White clearly fails in the fight, Black is favorable in the game.];W[cp];B[ll];W[lk];B[kl];W[qh];B[rh];W[fo];B[kk];W[lj];B[qb]
;W[ld];B[kj]LB[lc:a]C[As to the attachment of W80, what's the purpose of B81? If Black plays hane at 'a', it doesn't seem that White would have any good tactic.];W[mc];B[li];W[mi];B[nd];W[ri];B[rj];W[nc]LB[le:a][kc:b][lc:c]C[W88 is also weird! Since White worries about his big dragon on the right side and dares not play at 'a', eventually causing Black to block down at 'b', then why White doesn't play at 'c' with W88?]

;B[ic];W[pc]LB[pb:a]C[W116: If White plays at 'a', White would certainly make life, but this way, Black will take the ko at 116, White ends in gote and White's situation is not good either. In the game, although White is ko-alive, but it introduces many complicated variations, Black can easily make mistakes, this may be White's plan of creating complications and troubles!];B[jh];W[ih];B[pb];W[qf];B[rf];W[rg];B[qg];W[rb];B[ra];W[qf]
;B[sb];W[pi];B[qj];W[hb]C[W130: Because White doesn't have any ko threats if directly starting the ko, White aims to create ko threats with W130.];B[gc]LB[gb:a][ja:b][qg:c]C[B131 is not good, exchanging with W 'a' makes the ko of W 'b' light. For Black to reinforce the ko at 'c' would be simple and clear, and Black is favorable.];W[gb];B[qg];W[fc];B[fd]
;W[hc];B[hd];W[gd];B[ge];W[qf];B[pe];W[ja];B[ia];W[in];B[hn];W[ji];B[im];W[lm]
;B[ib];W[fe];B[gc];W[re];B[gd]LB[gf:a]C[B153 eliminating the ko is a hasty move! In fact Black should answer the ko threat, next White takes, Black can give up the ko by playing at 'a', this way Black would still can keep the lead.];W[rd];B[qg];W[jd];B[jc];W[qf];B[mk];W[sf]
;B[nl];W[ec]LB[gf:a]C[Through W162, in the exchange not only the original dead white stones come to life and a group of black stones also get captured, Black clearly incurs a loss, the situation has been turned around instantly!];B[be];W[mj];B[ml];W[ce];B[cf];W[df];B[bf];W[bd];B[dg];W[eg]

;W[ae]C[With W186, White protects his corner territory, so far White is better off in the game.];B[cm]C[B187: Black invades regardless of his own safety, certainly feeling that the situation is not to his advantage.];W[cl];B[dm];W[el];B[em];W[fl];B[fm];W[gk];B[gl]C[When White plays W194, B195 is an overplay! The reason why Black plays like this is, that even if Black connects back, Black would lose the game by a small margin. However, this kind of desperate fight indeed seems to bully Lee Changho!];W[ei];B[eh]
;W[gm];B[hl];W[fh];B[fi];W[ej];B[gh];W[fg];B[bg];W[gn]LB[bk:a][eo:b][fp:c]C[W206 is not that simple and clear! White should play the sente move at 'a', then play W206, this way when Black attaches at 'b', White can retreat at 'c' to fight with Black in the capturing race.];B[eo]
;W[hm]LB[fp:a]C[In the game, when Black plays B207, for White to play at 'a' is already too late, White can only start a ko with W208.];B[go];W[ho];B[jg];W[if];B[hn];W[hi];B[jj];W[kg]LB[hk:a][gf:b][gj:c][gi:d][fj:e]C[In fact, this is just fine, when Black ataris with B215, only if White connects with W216, next B 'a', W 'b', B 'c', W 'd' and B 'e', after this exchange, White encloses territory and can still win the game by a narrow margin. In the game, the inexplicable play causes White to incur a loss of more than 10 points, Lee Changho suddenly collapses.]
