;W[ed];B[ic]C[In the opening, Black grabs territory and White takes influence, the key is how White to attack B7 which is closer to White's thickness.];W[df];B[cg];W[dh];B[ch];W[di];B[ci];W[dj];B[dg];W[eg];B[cj];W[dk]
;B[cl];W[kc]C[W20 is inevitable.];B[ie];W[ke]LB[oc:a][hd:b][mc:c]C[But the play of W22 is a little careless, and White is not well prepared as to B 'a' while Black takes tenuki and protects the corner, this way White is difficult to obtain a big profit by attacking.

There are two ways to play W22, first, to peep at 'b' to make Black heavy, second, to approach the corner at 'a', watch and see whether Black dares invade at 'c' to lead to a fierce fight.];B[oc];W[hd];B[he];W[id];B[jd]
;W[jc];B[fe]C[When W24, Black presses with B25, then Black jumps with B29 to handle lightly.];W[hc]LB[ef:a][gc:b][je:c][cf:d][be:e]C[W30 is a move to cause White's passivity. White certainly should connect at 'a', next B 'b' and W 'c', this way at any rate Black is still not stable, White can take sente and push at 'd', cut at 'e'.];B[ef];W[de];B[fg];W[eh];B[gi]C[From B31 to B35, the roles of attack and defense are switched.]
;W[cf];B[bf];W[be];B[ck]C[Although White gains a big profit with W36, but after Black connects with B39, White's six stones are not easy to stick the head out, the center is taken control of by Black, White fails in the fight.];W[fk]LB[gk:a][dl:b]C[W40 and W42 are the reason why White sinks into bitter battle! With W40 White should aim to grab the vital point at 'a' in the center by pressing at 'b'.];B[hk];W[dm]LB[em:a][dl:b]C[W42 is clearly unreasonable, now White can only tolerate at 'a', in the real game, Black is left with the push and cut at 'b', White can't resist.];B[kd]
;W[ld];B[je];W[le]LB[mc:a][fn:b]C[W46 is also unreasonable, the original move is to hang at 'a', moreover, White also can consider to strengthen at 'b' in an unfavorable situation.];B[ib];W[mc];B[gc];W[gb];B[gd];W[hb];B[fb];W[jb]
;B[dl]C[After Black takes advantage in sente following B47, Black pushes and cuts with B55, White is already in a big losing situation.];W[el];B[em];W[fm];B[en];W[ep];B[fo]LB[gl:a]C[B61: If Black peeps at 'a', White already can't continue the game.];W[hl];B[il];W[hm];B[gk]

;B[lm];W[lo];B[pm];W[pj];B[nj];W[jf];B[if];W[kf];B[ec];W[db];B[fh]C[Through B101, Black makes life completely, White also will lose big.];W[qg];B[qk]
