;B[qj];W[nq];B[pn];W[pr]C[The play of W8 and W10 is Chen Yaoye's favorite.];B[fc]LB[cf:a][di:b]C[B11: If Black approaches the corner at 'a', Black worries that White may play two-space pincer at 'b'.];W[cf];B[fe]LB[id:a]C[B13: Black's common move is make extension at 'a', the play in the real game is of good momentum and also reasonable.];W[db];B[kd]C[B15: Black normally will make extension one line to the left, since Black already achieves his purpose. In fast games, more unusual moves appear often to seek victory in "variations".]
;W[gd]C[The peep of W16 is alert.];B[ec]LB[fd:a][hf:b][fg:c][hh:d]C[B17: If Black connects at 'a', White likely will make the knight's move at 'b', next B 'c' and W 'd', this way White takes chance to reduce Black's big moyo. In the game, the peep of B17 is sente, White also strengthens the corner territory.];W[dc];B[ge]C[Black presses with B19, White's one stone is somewhat contained for now.];W[oe];B[pf];W[nc];B[nb]
;W[ob];B[mc];W[nd];B[pb];W[id];B[lb]C[The tiger move of B29 is the original move.];W[he];B[de];W[hg]LB[ce:a][gg:b][hf:c]C[W32: White should block at 'a', next B 'b' and W 'c', since Black's shape is thin, when both sides run out, White can stick the head out in the front.]
;B[ce]C[Black pushes with B33, White incurs loss in territory. After the exchange, W32 appears isolated, White's loss outweighs its gain.];W[ed];B[df];W[fd];B[dj]LB[ci:a]C[B37: For Black to make extension at 'a' is steady, the play in the game looks superficial, Black perhaps wants to obtain sente.];W[cl];B[mq]C[The attachment of B39 is a very big point.];W[mp];B[lq];W[op];B[pq]
;W[po];B[qo];W[oo];B[qm];W[qr];B[rq];W[rr];B[lp]C[Through B51, it becomes a joseki, both sides get what they want.];W[dh]LB[gq:a][hq:b]C[W52: White should make extension at 'a' or 'b'.];B[eh]
;W[di];B[ei];W[cj];B[dk];W[ck]C[Through W58, White only takes some territory and has no attacking posture.];B[hq]C[So, through B59, after Black obtains the absolute big point, Black is easier to play.];W[ng];B[ph];W[kg];B[gh];W[fq];B[bh]

;B[ni];W[of];B[pg];W[ro];B[ki];W[qn]C[With B79, B83 and W82, W84, both sides takes vital points and are not willing to fall behind.];B[lf];W[lg];B[kf]C[B85 and B87 are strong moves.];W[mf]LB[jg:a][mg:b]C[W88: If White extends at 'a', Black will wedge and cut at 'b'.]
;B[mh];W[ld];B[kc];W[jf];B[je];W[le];B[ke];W[mg];B[if];W[md];B[hf]C[B97 and B99 are thick moves, forcing White to make life painfully with two eyes.];W[ne];B[go]C[After Black takes the vital point with B101, Black is favorable for the game.]
;W[fm];B[ep];W[eq];B[en]LB[gm:a]C[B105 is a bad move, Black should simply attach at 'a'.];W[em];B[gm];W[gl];B[fn]LB[hm:a]C[B109 is also a bad move, Black still should extend at 'a'.];W[hm];B[gn]
;W[fk];B[cn];W[bn];B[bo]C[The attachment and cut of B113 and B115 are negated by White easily, it is perhaps a miscalculation.];W[do];B[dn];W[bm];B[hl];W[hk]C[W120: White gets to extend into the center, Black's loss is heavy, the situation has been turned around.];B[il];W[ik];B[jl]
