;W[od];B[oc];W[nc];B[pc];W[eq];B[dj]C[Since White first makes the exchange W10 and B11, ...];W[md];B[jd]LB[qf:a][ic:b]C[..., Black has the state of mind to pincer with B13. If Black still jumps to 'a' as joseki, White will make extension at 'b', this way White takes a little advantage with the exchange of W10 and B11.];W[pf];B[cn]
;W[qm];B[eo];W[gq];B[jg]C[From B15 to B19, Black concentrates on the left side.];W[he]LB[ff:a][ef:b][jf:c]C[The reduction point of W20 is worth study. To play at 'a' or 'b' is relatively common. In the real game, White perhaps aims to attach at 'c', but since the opponent is stronger in this area, White has no much assurance of success in the fight.];B[lc]C[With the knight of B21, Black reinforces the big-jump defect of B13 and B19.];W[ob];B[pb]C[And also it forces White to make the damaging exchange of W22 and B23, fitting Hane Naoki's thick style.]
;W[ee];B[ed];W[df];B[fe];W[jf]LB[ff:a][gf:b]C[W28: If White directly hang at 'a', Black will separate White at 'b', White will sink into a bitter battle.];B[if];W[ff];B[kf]C[B31: Black elects to play simply by capturing one stone, Black gains a lot.];W[fd]LB[ce:a][bd:b][di:c]C[W32: White should first make diagonal at 'a', next B 'b' and W 'c', this variation is clearly better than the real game.]
;B[ge];W[gf];B[gd];W[hd];B[gc];W[hf]C[White's sequence from W32 to W38 is too simple and not thoughtful!];B[eg]C[After Black strikes with B39, White's big group is too heavy.];W[ef];B[ne];W[ld];B[mf];W[jc]
;B[kd];W[kc];B[ic];W[ib];B[hc];W[mb];B[oa];W[lb];B[dh];W[ih];B[ig];W[hh];B[hj]TR[pf]LB[qk:a]C[Following B57, Black attacks tightly, as a result, Black's early advantage all disappears. With B57 Black should first make extension at 'a', here is the big point. If White wants to escape W14 (the marked stone), Black then can do a two-pronged attack.]

;B[dg];W[fg]C[Through W72, Black almost gains nothing, White instead gains five points, Black clearly fails.];B[dq];W[dp];B[ep];W[dr];B[fq];W[er];B[qq]LB[qk:a]C[The play of B79 is a little hasty, Black should make extension at around 'a'.];W[pq];B[qp]

;B[pr];W[dk]C[The cut of W96 is good ko threat.];B[ck];W[dl];B[el];W[cl];B[bk];W[cg];B[dm]LB[bi:a]C[B103 is the last losing move! Black should directly jump to 'a', the situation is still complicated.];W[qr];B[bi]
;W[fl]C[W106 is good move!];B[fk];W[gh];B[pr];W[gk];B[gl];W[qr]C[Through W112, Black can't find a proper ko threat on the board.];B[qi]C[Black can only give up by making extension with B113.];W[rs]C[White eliminates the ko with W114 unconditionally, in this local variation, Black incurs loss of one move.];B[oi]C[So far, Black's situation is taking a free fall.];W[qe]
