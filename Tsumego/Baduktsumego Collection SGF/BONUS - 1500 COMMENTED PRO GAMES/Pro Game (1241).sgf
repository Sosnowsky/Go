Copyright by gogameworld.com and weiqi.tom.com.];B[qd]C[On 11/6, in the quarter-final game of the 10th Chinese NEC Cup, Gu Li takes Black and plays first.];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[fc]
;W[hc];B[nc];W[fd];B[qj];W[dj]C[In the opening through W10, both sides elect to enclose their own moyo.];B[fq];W[hq];B[cn];W[fp]LB[cq:a]C[The press of W14 is relatively conservative, White can consider to make the diagonal move at 'a', not giving Black any chance to turn his body around.];B[gp];W[gq]
;B[cq];W[eq];B[cp];W[po];B[qo];W[pp];B[qp];W[oq];B[or]LB[pn:a]C[B25: For Black to choose the small avalanche by playing hane at 'a' is relatively common.];W[pr];B[qq];W[nr]
;B[pn];W[np]C[In the real game, the joseki up to W30 is a little damaging to Black. However, this way Black takes sente easily, perhaps Gu Li just wants to have this sente.];B[fr];W[er];B[fo];W[ep];B[ed];W[ec]LB[ee:a]C[W36: White is reluctant to atari at 'a'.];B[ee];W[fe]C[The set pattern following W36 and W38 are popular recently.];B[dc]
;W[eb];B[ff];W[gf];B[de];W[cd];B[ce];W[cc];B[fg];W[dg];B[bf];W[ch];B[eg];W[he]C[Through W52, in terms of the whole game, White has nothing to complain.]
;B[gg];W[hg];B[hh];W[ig];B[cl];W[ek];B[ih];W[jg];B[gk];W[dm];B[dn];W[en]C[W62 and W64 are good moves, locally Black doesn't have any severe tactic.];B[cj]LB[cm:a]C[B65: Black seeks variation. The original move is to connect at 'a', however Black is not willing to play this way.]
;W[cm];B[bm];W[bn];B[bo];W[bl]LB[em:a]C[W70 is a bad move! White should simply connect at 'a', this way White is much thicker than the real game, White would be favorable for the game.];B[an];W[ck];B[dl];W[em];B[bk];W[el];B[al]
;W[ei]C[White's shape following W78 changes tone. Perhaps White realizes the bad result of W70, White's mind state has changed.];B[dk];W[gi];B[gh];W[di]LB[bh:a][hm:b]C[After White wraps up with W82, Black attaches at 'a', Black still can make life. With W82 White perhaps can consider taking tenuki and jumping at 'b' instead.];B[ik];W[gj];B[jh];W[kg];B[jm]
;W[hm];B[jo];W[nn];B[hp];W[go];B[iq];W[ip]LB[gr:a]C[W94: White strikes back bravely but has no certainty of success. The original move is to atari at 'a', this way the game would be still early.];B[ho];W[io];B[hn];W[in];B[gn]
;W[jq];B[gm];W[ir];B[eo]
(;W[ij]LB[hl:a][hk:b][gl:c][fl:d][do:e]C[W104 and W106 are inexplicable. With W104, if White extends at 'a', next B 'b', W 'c', B 'd' and W 'e', White's big dragon can escape, this way although locally White incurs loss, but White can still continue the game (see var a).];B[jj];W[ii];B[fj]C[B107 is the winning move. This move cuts White's living path described above, showing Gu Li's accurate calculation. White's big dragon suddenly dies and the game in fact is already over.];W[hl];B[hk];W[gl];B[fl]
