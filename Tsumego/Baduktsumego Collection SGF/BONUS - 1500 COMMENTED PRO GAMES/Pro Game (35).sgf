;B[qk]C[Zhou Heyang starts the game with "Chinese Opening", after this move, Won 4p begins his deep meditation, it's obvious that Won 4p takes this game very seriously.];W[kq];B[mq];W[ko]LB[hp:a]C[W8 can also defend at 'a', but W8 is more active.];B[cn]C[After B9 approachs the corner, White is deep in thinking again.];W[cp];B[ck];W[dl]TR[ko]C[W12 aims to give a full play to the marked stone.];B[cl]
;W[dn];B[ch];W[gc];B[io];W[iq];B[im]C[B17 and 19 reduced White's territory.];W[km];B[ik];W[gp]C[This game is the slowest among the four quarter-final games (the other three are all between Korean players), both sides know how important this game is.];B[nc]C[B23 turns back and protects the corner, it's a good move. So far Black is leading in territory, whole board configration is reasonable. It seems Black has a successful opening.];W[np]LB[ce:a][ic:b][re:c][rd:d]C[W24 is hard, now it's very big to enclose the corner at 'a', but if Black forces at 'b', White still need to reinforce; If White reduces at 'c', Black can block at 'd', White is not good either.]
;B[po];W[nq]LB[no:a]C[Black's next move can attach at 'a', Black is satisfied, however White seems a little overconcentrated.];B[qe]C[B27 is a steady and good move. Zhou Heyang is optimistic about the situation, White may be questionable in the way he settles the lower right side.];W[jc]C[W28 is patient, Won 4p is one of the best among Korean youth players, his middle game and endgame are very strong, Zhou can't relax his vigilance.];B[no]C[B29 is sente.];W[mp];B[pl]C[B31 is a thick move, this move is the style of Zhou 9p, this eliminated all the invasion possibilities on the lower right corner.];W[pr];B[qq];W[cm]
;B[bm];W[dm];B[bn];W[dk];B[dj];W[di]LB[ej:a][ei:b][ii:c][eg:d][lj:e]C[W40 is very sharp, To White who lags behind in the current situation, he has to play this way to make the game complicated, smooth and steady play equals to sitting still and waiting for death. If W40 hanes at 'a', Black will play 40, then W 'b', B 'c', W 'd' and B 'e', this variation favors Black.];B[ej];W[ci]
;B[cj];W[bh]LB[cc:a][cd:b][ei:c]TR[ej]C[Through 44, due to coming out of the marked stone, Black's center is relatively safe. Now entering the corner at 'a' is imperative, after W 'b' blocks and Black makes life in the corner, White will press at 'c', this situation will be very complex.];B[cd]LB[cc:a]C[B45 attaches under, Zhou is not satisfied with placement at 3-3 point.];W[ce]LB[cc:a][dc:b][eh:c]C[After thinking for a long time, White hanes from outside, If 46 hanes at 'a', Black will play 46, after W 'b' and B 'c', White has no assurance of success.]
;B[dc];W[ed];B[bc];W[be];B[fb];W[cb];B[cc];W[fc];B[gb]LB[eb:a][hc:b][ec:c][hd:d]C[Through 55, Black is alive, this is better than direct placement at 3-3 point, from a global point of view, this variation on the upper left favors White. Also White now can hane at 'a', after B 'b', W 'c' and B 'd', White will experience a big loss.]
;W[eb]C[Won 4p surprisingly chooses to kill the corner.];B[ec];W[db];B[hc];W[hd];B[hb];W[bb];B[id];W[gd];B[jd]C[Through 65, although White's corner is not small, but Black's moyo on the upper right is huge, it's not good for White.];W[mc]C[In the place where Black is very thick, W66 has to invade deeply, White is dangerous.];B[md]
;W[ld]C[W68 is the strongest response.];B[nd];W[kd]LB[le:a]C[W70 is the vital point, if White extends in haste to 'a', Black is easy to answer, now White hopes to drag one Black's group to run together.];B[jb]C[B71 is the right answer.];W[kf];B[if]LB[kb:a][ic:b][ia:c][kc:d][lb:e]C[If Black doesn't play at 73, White can attack Black by the sequence W 'a', B 'b', W 'c', B 'd' and W 'e'. Put this another way, White 73 becomes sente.]
;W[kh]C[Now White is leading in territory, Black has to turn the right side to real territory by attacking White.];B[do];W[eo]LB[co:a][fn:b][en:c][em:d][fo:e]C[W76 is inevitable, if White cuts at 'a', Black will play 76, then W 'b', B 'c', W 'd' and B 'e'.];B[co];W[ep];B[mh]C[B79 is a good point, White is weak on the top, it's hard to invade the right side.];W[mf]
;B[nf]C[After B81, Black gains a lot of territory on the right, now Black's leading in territory.];W[ih];B[he]C[B83 is very thick, after 83, Black is very easy to make life on the top.];W[fk];B[kl]LB[fj:a]C[B85 is a safe play, White has no good follow-up tactics even if Black presses at 'a'.];W[ll];B[kk];W[lk];B[lj]C[Zhou 9p is very careful to play around this area, now White feels very bad, the board becomes smaller and smaller, the room to overturn the game is less and less. Now Black is not only leading in territory but also thick everywhere.];W[mg]
;B[ng];W[mi];B[li];W[lh];B[nh]LB[mj:a][ji:b][lm:c][nj:d][mk:e][jh:f][jg:g][ig:h][ii:i][jj:j][gi:k][jf:l][kg:m]C[After B95, W 'a', B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f', W 'g', B 'h', W 'i', B 'j', W 'k', B 'l' and W 'm', this battle doesn't favor White.]
;W[mj];B[ji];W[jm]LB[il:a][mm:b][jh:c][jg:d][ig:e]C[After W98, B 'a', W 'b', B 'c', W 'd' and B 'e', White is in danger.];B[jh];W[jg];B[ki];W[ig];B[mk]C[B101 and 103 choose the safe moves, Black is good enough to enclose the territory like this.]
;W[ml];B[nk];W[fh];B[ge];W[fd];B[ic];W[bp]LB[ei:a][eh:b][bi:c][dh:d][ah:e][cg:f][bk:g]C[After W110, B 'a', W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 'e', W 'f', B 'g', Black will play safely. Black now is leading more than 10 points on the board.]
;B[bi];W[dh];B[ai]LB[ah:a][cg:b][bk:c]C[B113 certainly should atari at 'a', after B 'b' and W 'c' descent, White is alive.];W[il]C[114 is White's rights.];B[hl];W[jl];B[hj];W[fi]C[Through 118, it's easy to see Why 113 is not proper.];B[fj]
;W[gk];B[hk];W[gj];B[hi];W[gg];B[bk]LB[ek:a]C[B125 should push at 'a' first, White is difficult to answer.];W[kc];B[ia];W[hm]C[W128 cut is more or less sente, White reduces the deficit, Zhou made several mistakes in this area.];B[gm];W[hn]
;B[gi];W[ek];B[ef];W[cg];B[de];W[ac];B[gl]C[B137 connects back in gote, it's painful.];W[jk];B[jj];W[mb];B[kb];W[nb];B[ob]
;W[me]LB[hg:a]C[W144 is a good move, indirectly preventing Black from wedging at 'a'.];B[le];W[lf];B[lb];W[lc];B[ma];W[na];B[oa];W[la];B[gn];W[go];B[fn]
;W[en];B[or];W[nr];B[nm]LB[nl:a]C[B159 should turn at 'a', in the real game it has a bad aji.];W[ne];B[oe];W[ii];B[ij];W[oc];B[od];W[pc];B[pb]
;W[qc];B[qb];W[mn];B[ps]LB[nn:a]C[B171 certainly should connect at 'a'.];W[nl];B[ol];W[on]C[W174 is a good move.];B[pn];W[oq];B[qr];W[om]
;B[oo];W[nn]C[Through 180, due to Black's mistakes, now it's a burden for Black to give 6.5 points' komi.];B[ao];W[ap];B[mo];W[lo];B[ns];W[ms];B[mr]LB[os:a]C[If B187 connects at 'a', Black has no certainty of winning.];W[os];B[ho]
