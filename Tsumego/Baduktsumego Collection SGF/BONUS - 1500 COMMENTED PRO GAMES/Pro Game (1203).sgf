;W[jp];B[lq];W[cn];B[pj]LB[lo:a]C[Next W10 at 'a' is also a good point.];W[fc]C[The opening up to W10 is very popular recently.];B[ko];W[nc];B[pf];W[kd];B[jo];W[qq]
;B[ro];W[ji]C[Through W18, it seems the game will be a territory race.];B[fq];W[io];B[ip];W[gq]LB[fp:a][ho:b][eq:c][in:d]C[The attachment of W22 appears to be tesuji but it is not good in reality. W22 at 'a' is better. If Black still plays atari at 'b', White can simply hang at 'c', this way B 'd' taking one stone will be gote.];B[dq];W[cq]LB[ho:a][fp:b][in:c][eq:d]C[The exchange of B23 and W24 is bad, Black should simply play atari at 'a', White can only hane at 'b', next Black takes at 'c' and Black becomes very thick. White obtains corner territory after W 'd', but this game looks like a territory race, Black's taking ponnuki appears more powerful.]
;B[ho];W[eq];B[fp];W[in];B[hn];W[im];B[hm];W[il];B[fr];W[hl]C[Through W34, White already opens up situation.];B[ch];W[mq]TR[jp]C[The attachment of W36 is good move. W6 (the marked white stone) can be used in many ways, Black can't exert power.]

;W[dl];B[do];W[dn];B[bo];W[eo];B[ep]C[The exchange from B43 to B55 is not necessary.];W[oe]C[Locally Black didn't incur any loss, but if White encloses all upper left territory, Black can't keep balance in territory.];B[pe];W[ng];B[ic]LB[hc:a][ec:b][jc:c]C[B59 at 'a' is relatively better, this way B 'b' and 'c' become miai, Black must get one, Black most likely can make life.]
;W[jb];B[fk]C[B61: Black still should find ways to destroy territory and fight for a victory.];W[fj];B[gj];W[gk];B[cl];W[ej];B[bn];W[cj]C[The exchange from B61 to W68 makes White thicker.];B[oc]C[Black clearly gives up destroying upper-left territory, but this way Black's territory is obviously not enough.];W[nd];B[kc]
;W[je];B[ec];W[gb];B[ed];W[cb];B[nj]TR[ic]C[Not sure whether Liu Shizhen's judgment was wrong, till the end he didn't think of escaping the marked black stone, but this way White is in fact already winning.];W[lm];B[mo];W[mn];B[li];W[no];B[np]
