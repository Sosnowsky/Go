Copyright by gogameworld.com and weiqi.tom.com.]RE[B+R];B[qd];W[dc];B[de]C[As always, Black plays the high approach of B3, perhaps Cho U thinks this move is inevitable.];W[pp];B[cp]C[B5: Black starts to vary, in the first game, Black attaches the upper-left corner.]
;W[ce];B[cf];W[cd];B[fq]C[B9 is a unique thinking, Cho U's opening is always relatively fresh.];W[df];B[cg];W[ef];B[cj];W[nc]LB[pc:a][kc:b]C[The large knight's approach of W14 is Yu Bin's favorite play, if Black makes the diagonal at 'a', White will make two-space extension, it is simple and clear.];B[kc]C[Black counterattacks with B15, it is just the place White wants to make extension. Enemy's good point is also my good point.]
;W[pd]LB[qc:a][pc:b][qb:c][rc:d][od:e][pe:f][oc:g][rb:h][pg:i]C[W16: For White to attach at 'a' is common joseki, next B 'b', W16, B 'c', W 'd', B 'e', W 'f', B 'g', W 'h' and B 'i'. This way White gets to turn around his body, but in this situation, White's configuration in the upper left corner is not satisfying.];B[qc]LB[pc:a][qe:b]C[If B17 at 'a', White will not cut at 17 but play hane at 'b' instead, Black is not good.]
;W[qe]LB[pf:a][nf:b][qg:c][ic:d]C[W18: White can consider to jump at 'a', next B18, W 'b' and B 'c', White obtains sente and can play at 'd'.];B[re];W[pc]LB[qf:a][rf:b][qg:c][od:d][hc:e]C[W20 is a novel play. The common play is to extend at 'a', followed by B 'b', W 'c', B20, W 'd' and B 'e'. White is indeed a little dissatisfied in this variation, not sure whether Teacher Yu had studied W20 or not, never saw this before.];B[qf]
;W[pe];B[hc];W[qb]LB[rf:a]C[B23 and W24 are miai good points, both are very big.  The simple hane of W24 is better than cutting at 'a'. This forms a new variation, White is very thick, Black's speed is faster, so this variation is about even.];B[qn];W[nq];B[qp];W[qq];B[rq];W[pq]LB[qo:a][rp:b][ro:c][po:d][rn:e]C[W30: White can atari at 'a', next B 'b', W 'c', B 'd' and W 'e'. In the game, Teacher Yu selects simple and clear play.]
;B[ro];W[kq];B[fc]C[B33: Black wants to take advantage in sente.];W[gd]LB[gc:a][ee:b]C[W34 is good sequence, if B 'a', then W 'b'. If White simply plays at 'b', later on White can't strike at 34 any more.];B[ed]TR[qn]SQ[hc]C[B35 is tenacious counterattack, Cho U is reluctant to incur loss. Because Black has the triangled stone, after White pushes and cuts, White can't capture the square-marked black stone.];W[jd]C[W36: White doesn't have more severe tactic. So far, W34 seems questionable, White overlooks Black's counterattack.];B[ib]
;W[ee];B[mp]LB[dd:a][gc:b][gb:c][ec:d]C[B39: If Black connects at 'a', next W 'b', B 'c' and W 'd', Black will be captured in a ladder. B39 doesn't achieve the effect of ladder breaker.];W[mq];B[jq]C[B41 again is an attachment! This move is similar to B29 in the game 1. But today in this situation it is not a bad move. Because Black has no weak groups on the board, White's thickness can't be effectively utilized.];W[jp];B[iq];W[kp];B[fo]C[B45 is the right shape. Because in the upper left corner, Black is always left with the aji of connecting out, White is also not easy to strengthen, so in the opening Black is a little favorable.]
;W[co];B[do];W[rb]C[White attaches with W46 then takes tenuki, it is very strange.];B[qi];W[qk];B[eb]C[B51 is hard to understand, later one when ladder is favorable, connecting out is very severe. Cho U has favorable consciousness.];W[dd];B[cn]C[B53 is a big move. On the board, Black is leading about 20 points in territory. Objectively, Teacher Yu meets a difficult problem.];W[po]C[W54 is not a bad move, very thick.];B[rm];W[pl]
;B[rg]C[B57 is the shape, here Black can't allow White to strike inside.];W[rr];B[sr];W[qo];B[rp];W[qr]C[White exploits Black with the sequence from W58 to B62, Black is a little uncomfortable.];B[rk];W[dh];B[ch];W[ip]LB[rj:a][rl:b][qj:c][ri:d][sj:e]C[W66: White should play hane at 'a', next B 'b', W 'c', B 'd' and W 'e', this way Black is thin.]
;B[ql]C[After Black connects with B67, how to use White's thickness is a question.];W[hq]C[W68 capturing two stone is the biggest move on the board. Now the board size becomes smaller, White's territory is still inadequate, White's situation is not optimistic.];B[hr];W[ir];B[gr];W[pm];B[pk];W[ok];B[qj];W[jr]C[After this move, it is time for lunch break.];B[mk];W[dk]
;B[ck];W[dl];B[cl];W[lc]C[W82 is a tesuji, testing Black's answer. Black has two choices: extend and descend.];B[kd];W[kb];B[jc];W[ml]LB[lk:a][ll:b]C[W86 is tight, if B 'a', White can obtain a big territory by playing at 'b'.];B[nk];W[nl]
;B[oj];W[lk]C[W90 is strong and unyielding. White at the bottom is very thick and not afraid of Black's cut. In this area White obtains some territory, White's situation takes a better turn.];B[ol];W[om];B[gm];W[im];B[jl];W[il];B[lj]LB[kk:a][jk:b]C[B95 and B97 is weird order. If W 'a', then B 'b', Black definitely will not sacrifice B95 easily.];W[ll]
;B[jj];W[kj]LB[ki:a][kk:b][li:c][rd:d]C[W100: White wants to obtain sente, if B 'a', then W 'b', B 'c' and W 'd', this big endgame is worth 10+ points.];B[kk];W[ki];B[ik]C[B101 and B103 are good counterattack moves.];W[jm];B[hk]C[Through B105, White in the center is a little thin.];W[fk]
;B[ih];W[gn];B[fd];W[db];B[ld]C[Now the game already enters into endgame fight, White's situation is still a little inferior.];W[kg]C[W112: White fights desperately.];B[li];W[lh];B[jh];W[kh];B[jf]C[B117 is calm, White is not easy to handle.];W[md]
;B[lb];W[mc];B[gf]C[B121 is big. Black is leading 10+ points on the board.];W[rd];B[og]C[W122 and B123 are all big endgames. Today Cho U's state is very good.];W[kl];B[jk];W[nf];B[ng];W[mh];B[ni];W[mf]
;B[kf];W[mi];B[mj];W[lf];B[da];W[ca];B[ea];W[bb];B[fn];W[hl];B[gk];W[eh];B[ei]C[The final game 4 will take place on 4/20.]
