Translation:GoGameWorld.];B[qd]C[This is one first round game of the 16th Fujitsu Cup, and it is the only winning game among the four Chinese players in the first round, Gu Li played very well and didn't give Cho Chikun any chance.];W[dd];B[fc];W[cf];B[pq]

;B[pb];W[ne];B[rb];W[of];B[qh]C[Through 23, it is a joseki, but Black has obtained a big corner in the beginning, it looks like that Black is not bad.];W[ec]C[W24 seems very important, but it is a questionable move. Now Black has already occupied two corners. If Black takes one more corner, White is hard to compete with Black's territory! White now should take the lower left corner to keep balance.];B[fd];W[ic];B[dp]LB[ef:a]TR[fc]C[After Black takes the empty corner with B27, White has to gain profits by attacking the marked black stone, but the direction of W28 is wrong! White on the right can't enclose a big territory, but can be used as thickness, so White should attack Black at 'a', driving Black to the right, then White can build a big moyo on the left side.];W[ie]
;B[ef];W[ch];B[hf]C[B29 and B31 are simple good moves! White is powerless to continue his attack, also the aji of White's corner becomes very bad. In just 30 moves, White has two dubious moves and is already in an unfavorable situation. Afterwards, White's shape settlement seems uninspired.];W[if];B[hg];W[qo];B[op];W[iq]LB[jq:a]C[W36: White can also consider to split the lower side at 'a'.];B[kq];W[fq];B[eq]
;W[fp];B[cn];W[ql];B[qp];W[po];B[jo]C[Black plays in such a good tempo! especially when Black makes the diagonal of B43, then knight-attack with B45,  Black not only obtains territory but also attacks White, each move is very efficient!];W[oo];B[np];W[ig];B[hc];W[eb]LB[ib:a]C[In face of the asking move of B49, W50 is slow, now Black obtains three big corners and has so much territory, White's only hope is that, before Black settles his upper left, White has to make some troubles there, but White surprisingly turns to protect the corner! White can only stand at 'a' and threaten Black, this is better than the real game.]
;B[jc]C[The clamp of B51 is a good move!];W[ib];B[id];W[jd];B[hd];W[jb];B[ih]C[Through 57, Black settles himself beautifully and also controls the center with the turn, Black's advantage is more clear.];W[ck];B[fr];W[gr];B[er];W[io]
;B[in];W[ho];B[dg];W[cg];B[di]C[B65 and B67 are strong, if over here Black safely and easily gets what he wants, then White would have no chance of winning.];W[dh];B[eh];W[ei];B[dj];W[cm];B[dn];W[cj]LB[fh:a][eg:b][fi:c]C[W72 and W74 are the last losing moves! now White can only atari at 'a' to fight desperately, then B 'b' and W 'c', anyway Black on the top is not alive yet. In the game, Black has only one unsettled group, and White unexpectedly wants to make a territory of about 15 points! Black has three big corners, what White have in order to compare with Black's territory?]

In this game, Gu Li's shape settlement after the opening is brilliant! a joyful game! Hope Gu Li can also play this well in the second round!]
