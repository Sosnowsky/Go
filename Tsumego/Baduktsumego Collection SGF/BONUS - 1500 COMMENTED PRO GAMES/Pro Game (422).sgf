;B[oq];W[qj];B[fo];W[dn];B[dr];W[ck]LB[cq:a]C[The play of W12 is rarely seen, the common move is to make diagonal at 3-3. After the extension of W12, it forms a rare shape in the lower left corner.];B[kp];W[jo];B[ko];W[jn];B[jq];W[ho]
;B[cp]LB[cq:a][fp:b]C[B19: If Black makes diagonal at 'a', then after White blocks at 19, Black is still left with defect at 'b'. Following B19, it leads to an exchange, in terms of result, White is not bad.];W[cq];B[dq];W[co];B[bp];W[ep]LB[bq:a]C[W24 and W26 are inevitable, White wouldn't block at 'a' to capture two black stones, since after Black plays atari at 24, White can't tolerate.];B[bq];W[fp];B[ql]
;W[qf];B[nc];W[rd];B[kc];W[qo]C[The attachment of W32 is a little surprising, the common move is to protect the corner in the upper left corner.];B[po]LB[pp:a]C[B33: Black should calmly extend at 'a', this way White doesn't seem to have any good answer.];W[qm]C[W34 is a good move for dodging.];B[qk]LB[pm:a][pn:b][on:c][qn:d]C[The bump of B35 is very strong and unyielding, if B 'a', then W 'b', B 'c' and W 'd', White can easily take the lower-right corner, Black's loss in territory will be huge. The sequence following B35 is inevitable, Black has protected his corner territory.]

;B[ok];W[np];B[nq];W[mp];B[qg]LB[mq:a]C[B53: If Black crawls over normally at 'a', Luo Xihe may feel Black is not easy to play if White gets to strengthen one more move on the right side, so in the real game Black attaches in, this move fits his style.];W[pi];B[ml];W[mm];B[pf];W[nj];B[qe];W[mk]LB[mq:a]C[W60: White may want to turn at 'a', but the variations will be complicated, perhaps now Choi Cheolhan feels his situation is not bad, so he elects to play simply and clearly.]
;B[mq]C[After B61, Black is way ahead in territory, the outcome of the game will depend on how much territory White can enclose on the left side.];W[df];B[hc];W[hf];B[ll]C[With the extension of B65, Black tries to find some threads to play.];W[kn];B[lk];W[lj];B[kj];W[ki];B[li];W[mj]
;B[ji];W[kh];B[jk];W[ij];B[jj];W[jg]C[After W78, both sides have no way to retreat, White attacks and drives Black into his moyo, if Black lives, White's territory definitely will be inadequate, but Black itself is also very dangerous.

After this move, it is time for lunch break.];B[nl];W[nh];B[hi];W[jd]LB[jl:a]C[W82 is too slow, White should directly attach at 'a', this way Black will be very dangerous.];B[mg]
;W[mh];B[fi]C[B85: Black takes tenuki and is very alert.];W[jc]C[W86: White's profit is not big, Black will take the lead only if Black makes life the center.];B[jb];W[ib];B[kb];W[di];B[ri];W[rj];B[qi];W[oj];B[fg]
;W[hg];B[fk]LB[hh:a]C[B97: Black should hit at 'a'. In the real game, it equals White takes one move tenuki and Black reinforces one move, but Black is still very dangerous, so Black doesn't reinforce well.];W[gj];B[gi];W[hj];B[gk];W[hl];B[hk];W[jl];B[il];W[im];B[ik]
;W[ej];B[dh];W[fj];B[ii];W[ff]LB[dg:a]C[W112: If White plays at 'a', Black's big dragon most likely will die, in the real game White fails to play the best move.];B[gm];W[hm];B[em];W[kl]C[W116: If White continues to kill Black strongly, Black can play atari here, White itself is also very thin.];B[gp];W[go]
;B[eo];W[do];B[dk]C[The attachment of B121 is a good move.];W[ek];B[el];W[dj];B[cl];W[dl];B[dm];W[cm];B[bl];W[ch];B[dk]
;W[eq];B[er];W[dl];B[dg];W[cg];B[dk];W[fr];B[cj];W[ci];B[bk]C[Through B141, Black makes life and is clearly favorable. After Black's big dragon is alive, Black already wins the game for sure.];W[bj];B[kk];W[ic]

If White turns at 'a' with W208, Black is leading about 10+ points on the board. In the game, there is a loophole in the upper-left corner, White incurs a big defeat.]
