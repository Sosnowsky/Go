Translation:GoGamdWorld.];B[dp]C[This is the game 2 of the best-of-5 series in the 37th Korean Wangwi title match, after winning this game, Lee Changho leads 2:0 over his teacher Cho Hunhyun, it seems that the teacher will end up losing again after he was trying so hard to obtain the right to challenge.];W[pp];B[dc];W[pd];B[ci]
;W[gd];B[id]LB[de:a]C[Lee Changho sometimes will play the low Chinese opening, as to the approach of W6, the counter-pincer of B7 was once popular, to defend at 'a' instead is more steady.];W[dd];B[cd];W[ce];B[cc];W[de];B[fd]LB[fc:a][gc:b][hd:c][hc:d][ie:e]C[B13: For Black to simply jump at 'a' is also playable, to answer this, Lee Changho once blocked at 13, B 'b', W 'c', B 'd' and W 'e', it is slack but simple, Black maybe worries that the opponent will answer like this, so Lee adopts a more active play in the game.]

;B[gf];W[ci]C[From the cap of W16 to W28, the local variation comes to an end, I think White can't be satisfied, because White has to connect and reinforce painfully at 28.];B[nc];W[qf];B[co]TR[id]C[After the approach of B29, the diagonal's reinforcing of B31 is a good move! I think Black's opening is already one step ahead. Therefore, the variation to deal with the counter-pincer of the marked black stone still needs further study.];W[jd]LB[pb:a][ld:b]C[Next the attachment of W32 is an asking move, the ensuing B 'a' and B 'b' are very calm answers, White feels tasteless. For White to jump down to 'a' is better, allowing Black to enclose territory.];B[pb];W[qc];B[ld]
;W[ie];B[hd];W[jq];B[lf]LB[lg:a]C[B39: Black should consider to make the large jump at 'a', this way White would be difficult to sacrifice.];W[kg]C[With W40, White jumps out lightly, because Black always wants to stick his head out in the front, White takes the chance to escape.];B[lg];W[kh];B[lh];W[ki]LB[kd:a]C[W44: However, White has missed an opportunity, if White instead bumps at 'a', Black would very confused to answer, if Black answers again, White already gets out in sente; If Black tenukis, after White hanes underneath, Black would be very painful.]
;B[mj]LB[kd:a][le:b][qi:c]C[After the exchange of W44 and B45, White hits at 'a', then Black can connect at 'b' to obtain sente, because the check at 'c' becomes very severe.];W[qi];B[jf]C[In the game, Black gets to play the knight's move at 45 and also comes back to grab 47, Black still keeps the lead.];W[nb]C[W48 makes Black uncomfortable.];B[mb];W[mc];B[md]LB[kf:a][ke:b][ob:c][nd:d][oc:e]C[B51: Due to the existence of the push at 'a' and the diagonal at 'b', if Black ataris at 'c', W 'd', Black can't connect at 'e' and has to take, the aji is very bad, the play in the game is better.]
;W[oc];B[lc];W[dr];B[dq];W[fr]C[W54 and W56 are roughly acceptable.];B[cr];W[ob]LB[np:a]C[W58 is an endgame worth about 15 points, to defend the corner at around 'a' would be better.];B[gq];W[gr];B[or]C[Black makes a mock attack with B59 then invades at 61.

After this move it is time for noon break.];W[qq]
;B[lq];W[hq];B[pl]C[After gaining sente, Black invades at 65 again, Black's advantage is obvious.];W[qn]C[W66: White is painful but has no other alternative.];B[qr]C[With the sequence after B67, Black settles the shape in sente, which puts winds in Black's sails.];W[rr];B[op];W[pr];B[po];W[oo];B[oq];W[pn]

;W[jn];B[kn];W[jm];B[pi]LB[pj:a][bk:b][bl:c][on:d]C[B91: Black normally plays at 'a', W 'b' and B 91, after obtaining sente, Black blocks at 'c', and Black is still left with the cut at 'd', it is also a simpler play.];W[pj];B[qj];W[oi];B[ph];W[qk]
;B[rj];W[qh];B[pk]C[Through B71 to 99, both sides have gained some profit, but the board becomes smaller, it is entering Lee Changho's skillful endgame and also now he is favorable, White can't avoid his defeat.];W[oj];B[rk]LB[rh:a][qg:b][rm:c][ri:d]C[The turn of B101 is very dubious. Black should clamp at 'a', White must connect at 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B101, this way Black already has a living shape, White still doesn't capture the two black stones completely, Black wins for sure.];W[rm]C[After White makes the diagonal of W102 in sente, Black starts to enter into a puzzling state.];B[rl];W[oh]
;B[oe]LB[pg:a][og:b][rh:c]C[B105: First, Black should simply extends at 'a', then W 'b' and B 'c'.];W[ne];B[pg];W[og];B[rh];W[qg];B[ri];W[bk];B[pe]LB[nd:a][od:b][bl:c]C[Next, B113 is unnecessary, Black needs only to play at 'a', then W 'b' and B 'c', Black still wins for sure.]
;W[od];B[qe];W[re];B[rd];W[rf];B[qd];W[rc];B[nf];W[sd];B[nd];W[bm]C[The jump of W124 is a good move, Black is forced to give way.];B[cm];W[bl]
;B[bn];W[dn];B[cn];W[pf];B[me];W[fn]LB[hg:a][el:b]C[W132: If White first probes at 'a', then looks for a chance to make the knight's move at 'b', White most likely can turn the game around.];B[hh];W[hg];B[ig];W[gg];B[ii]
;W[if];B[jg];W[ff];B[je]C[From B133 to B141, the local variation comes to an end, next it leads to a long and complicated endgame fight, and the game becomes very close.];W[be];B[na];W[of];B[ne];W[pc];B[gh];W[hf];B[he];W[fg]
