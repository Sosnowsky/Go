;W[eq];B[dp];W[dq];B[co];W[cq]C[W10 avoiding the large avalanche joseki is a clever choice, which will lead to a fierce fight, B3 will become effective.];B[fp];W[gq];B[de];W[ce];B[cf];W[cd];B[df];W[fc]
;B[dj];W[bh]C[It is hard to judge whether W20 is good or bad, in the game, in terms of points, White takes advantage.];B[dd];W[cc];B[ch];W[oc]LB[qj:a]C[The corner-approach of W24 is no good, White should play the splitting move at 'a'. Because White takes relatively more territory on the left side, breaking up the situation should be what White desires for.];B[pj];W[ld]C[After B25, White doesn't know how to continue and can only elect to make the knight's move with W26.];B[pe]C[After the small diagonal of B27, Black's opening is successful.];W[qn]C[The selection point with the corner-approach of W28 is correct.]
;B[qp];W[ql];B[rk];W[nm];B[ok];W[op];B[po]C[Facing with White's deliberate provocation of W34, Peng Quan elects to counterattack with the sequence following B35. In the first two games, both sides elected to fight, this game has no exception!];W[ol];B[nn];W[nk];B[mm];W[oi]LB[mn:a][no:b][nj:c]C[The press of W40 is no good. White should directly cut at 'a', then B 'b' and W 'c', this is better than the real game.]
;B[pi];W[mn];B[no];W[ln];B[nj];W[qk];B[rj];W[mj];B[lm]C[B49 pressing out is severe.];W[km];B[ll];W[oj];B[oh]
;W[ni];B[kn]C[Through the cut of B55, Black is favorable in the fight.];W[ko];B[jn];W[mp];B[jo];W[jp];B[np];W[mq];B[kp];W[mo];B[nq]LB[kq:a][oq:b][oo:c]C[The block of B65 is not relentless enough! Black should descend at 'a', followed by W 'b' and B 'c', White doesn't seem to have any good counterattack maneuver but will be on the verge of collapse.]
;W[nr];B[or];W[jm];B[kk];W[ip];B[ho];W[im];B[hn];W[kq];B[ik]C[However, through B75, Black is still leading the game.];W[cn];B[bo];W[en]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.]
;B[gp]LB[do:a]C[The press of B79 is a mistake, Black can only connect at 'a', White also has no good follow-up tactic.];W[do]C[After White cuts with W80, Black can only crawl on the second line.];B[bn];W[cm];B[bm];W[cl];B[bl];W[fq];B[gl];W[ck];B[bk]
;W[cj];B[bj];W[ci];B[bi];W[fk];B[fl];W[dh];B[cg];W[el];B[hp];W[hq];B[gk];W[fj]C[Through W102, White makes life easily, the game has been turned around.]
;B[lb]LB[pc:a]C[B103 is over-hasty. Black should make the diagonal at 'a', this way the game would be still very far from over.];W[qc];B[rc];W[ph];B[qh];W[pg];B[qg];W[jj];B[jk];W[kc];B[og]C[After W120, Black can't tolerate to make life painfully but to chase and kill White's big dragon in the center, the game enters into a critical phase.]
;W[pb];B[kb];W[jc];B[jb];W[ic];B[ib];W[hb];B[pk];W[on];B[li];W[mc]LB[lj:a][kj:b]C[If White lost the game, then the first step to defeat is W124! White should push at 'a', next B 'b', this way White on the left side would be definitely safe, and White on the right side is also already completely alive due to this exchange, this way White can strengthen at 124 and wins the game for sure.]
;B[mh];W[oo];B[oq];W[pn];B[ei];W[gi];B[gh];W[fi];B[pl];W[pp];B[rp];W[qq];B[qr]
;W[ro];B[rq];W[qo]LB[lj:a][kj:b][nh:c][ng:d][mi:e]C[W140 is a blunder! White can only push at 'a', if Black blocks at 'b', White can play the excellent push at 'c'! Black can only block at 'd', after the sente move of W 'e', White already has half eye, then White takes at 140 to live completely. However when W 'a', Black wouldn't block at 'b', instead Black will squeeze at 'e', because White's big dragon on the left is still not completely alive, the situation is still very complicated.  That's the reason why White should first push at 'a'.];B[rm]LB[pm:a][om:b][pf:c]C[B141: Black should bump at 'a', next W 'b' and B 'c', this way White already has one eye on the left side, although Black can make a ko-eye at the top, but the ko is worry-free for Black, this makes a big difference, Black wins the game for sure.];W[nh]
;B[ng];W[mi];B[fh];W[ej];B[mk];W[lh];B[hi];W[mg]C[After W150, Black becomes ko-alive.];B[nl];W[ml];B[gj];W[ek];B[nl]

;B[sj];W[ml];B[eo];W[dn];B[nl];W[hm];B[gm];W[ml];B[dk];W[dl];B[nl];W[io];B[om]
;W[in]C[Because White already escape partially, and Black at the top incurs a heavy loss, so after White saves back several white stones with W180 and W182, White's victory can't be altered.];B[qb];W[pc];B[rb];W[nf];B[of];W[oe];B[pf];W[ne];B[hd];W[gd];B[hc];W[gb]
