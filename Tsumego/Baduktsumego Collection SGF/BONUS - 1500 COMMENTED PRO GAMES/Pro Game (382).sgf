Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[In the second round of 1st Chang-ki Cup, Kong Jie 7p defeated Liu Xing 7p and advanced to the final eight. In this game, Kong Jie takes a big lead in the beginning, but in the end a dramatic scene almost appears.];W[dc]C[Liu Xing doesn't give a play to his talent in this game, he sinks into a bitter battle since the opening.];B[pp];W[cp];B[eq]
;W[oc];B[de];W[nq];B[lp];W[pf];B[od];W[nd];B[oe];W[pc];B[qe];W[qc];B[pi];W[qq]LB[qn:a]C[W18 entering the corner is rather common, White can also consider to double approach at 'a', next White can make a two-space extension on the right side, breaking up Black's moyo.]
;B[qp];W[pq];B[op];W[rq];B[np];W[mq];B[mp]C[Through B25, Black's configuration is ideal.];W[ng]LB[rp:a][qn:b][ne:c]C[W26 is the reason that leads to White's bitter battle, the value of simply escaping one stone is not big, White should turn at 'a', after B 'b', then White can press at 'c', this way the situation would still keep balance.];B[ne]
;W[md];B[me];W[ld];B[le];W[ke];B[kf];W[ph];B[oi];W[lg]LB[qh:a]C[W36 is a careless move, White should first descend at 'a' then play W36.];B[mh];W[mg];B[oh]
;W[og];B[qh]C[In the game Black is alert with B39 and B41! White's several stones don't have eye shape, Black's outside influence at the bottom will definitely be put into a good use.];W[lf];B[qf];W[jf];B[je]C[B45 is a strong move!];W[kg];B[kd];W[kf];B[kc];W[mb];B[ie]C[After the extension of B51, White's group in the center is still very heavy.]
;W[gc]LB[fd:a]C[W52 is inappropriate, after this move, White's situation has deteriorated. White should make the knight's move at 'a', this way Black definitely wouldn't get that thick as in the real game.];B[fd];W[ic];B[hd];W[fc];B[hf];W[hc];B[jd];W[ii];B[ig];W[jh];B[hi]C[B63 is strong and unyielding! Black fights by using his thickness, if White hanes, Black will cut, White is no good.]
;W[ij];B[hj];W[ik];B[hk];W[il];B[gm]C[After the knight's move of B69, Black is clearly favorable in the game.];W[cm];B[ck];W[dk]C[W72: White starts to fight desperately.];B[cl]C[B73: Black is not soft-hearted, and Black should play this way.];W[dl];B[dm]
;W[cn];B[em];W[dj];B[bi];W[hh];B[gh];W[ci];B[ch];W[bh];B[bj];W[bg];B[cg];W[cf]
;B[df];W[bf];B[bm];W[bn];B[di]C[B91 and B93 are good moves!];W[gi]LB[cj:a][ej:b]C[W94: If White connects at 'a', then Black will hane at 'b', White will die.];B[cj];W[hl];B[gk];W[gl]
;B[fk];W[cd];B[fm]TR[dk]C[In the game, through B101, the game-deciding move of W72 (the marked stone) fails completely. Now Black's advantage reaches a peak, we all thought Liu Xing already can't turn the game around, so we all stopped further study, but who can imagine ...];W[dq];B[lk];W[ih];B[hg];W[in];B[dr];W[cr];B[dp];W[cq]
;B[oq]LB[ki:a]C[B111 is over-steady! Black should first attack White's big dragon by playing at 'a', this way White still needs to live the big dragon and certainly have no time to play endgames.];W[or];B[rp];W[mj]C[In the game, with the sequence following W114, White uses his lonely stones as thickness, invading fiercely into Black's territory, Black's loss is heavy.];B[mk];W[nj];B[lj];W[nh];B[ni];W[mi];B[li]
;W[qg];B[pg];W[lh];B[ok];W[ph];B[rg];W[pg];B[ri];W[lm];B[mm];W[mn];B[nm];W[ip]
;B[pr]LB[sq:a][qr:b][lq:c]C[B135 almost becomes the losing move of this game, locally the correct play is to hane at 'a', next W 'b' and B 'c', this way Black can guarantee a small victory.];W[qr];B[nr];W[ps];B[mr];W[kq];B[kp];W[gq]C[After W142, it looks like White will turn the game around, because Kong Jie has used too much time and already incurs a two-point penalty.];B[jq]

;B[fr];W[ed]LB[kn:a][gr:b]TR[dr][eq][ep][dp][fr]C[But now Liu Xing perhaps is too excited, W158 is a regrettable losing move! After the game, he said he thought W158 was sente, in fact W 'a' is also sente (if White blocks at 'b', Black's five marked stones can't connect back), if White first plays at 'a' with W158, White would win the game by 1 or 2 points. If that happens, Kong Jie certainly can't sleep well that night!];B[kn]LB[ee:a]C[B159 is alert! The value of this move is clearly bigger than 'a'. Afterwards, White already has no chance of winning.];W[ee];B[ef]
