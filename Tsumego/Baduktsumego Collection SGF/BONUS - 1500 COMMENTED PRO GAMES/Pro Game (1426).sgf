;B[kc];W[qj];B[ql]C[B5, B7 and B9 are Kong Jie's favorite opening.];W[qg];B[pf];W[re];B[rd];W[qe]LB[pg:a]C[W14: White can also attach at 'a'.];B[pd];W[ld]C[White elects to play the light and nimble shoulder-hit of W16.];B[lc]
;W[nd];B[qf];W[rf];B[pe];W[mc];B[kd];W[le];B[ke];W[lf];B[jg];W[lh];B[oc];W[nb]
;B[pg];W[qh];B[pi];W[rk];B[ok];W[rl];B[ki];W[mj];B[ni];W[lk];B[qn];W[qm];B[pm]
;W[rm];B[lm];W[jk];B[jm];W[ng]C[Through W48, it forms a new shape.];B[fq]C[Gain or loss is subject to the following change in thickness and thinness later on.];W[ph];B[oh];W[hq];B[fo];W[kq];B[mq]
;W[ho];B[dn];W[hm]LB[cq:a];B[kj]C[B59: Black wants to strike the corner at 'a', this move is too big. In the game, Black strengthens his thinness by attacking, it is also playable.];W[kk];B[mi];W[li];B[kg];W[lg];B[ij];W[lj];B[il]
;W[kn];B[km];W[ik];B[hl];W[hk];B[gm];W[ie];B[je]LB[ic:a]C[White's exchange of W74 and B75 is alert, White is left with the jump at 'a'.];W[gk];B[jo];W[mr];B[lr]LB[nr:a]C[B79 is questionable. Black should play hane outside at 'a', forcing White to make life at 'a'.]
;W[lq];B[kr];W[mp];B[nq];W[nr];B[jq]LB[or:a]C[Furthermore, with B85 Black also should play hane at 'a'.];W[oq];B[np];W[op];B[no];W[oo];B[on]
;W[nn];B[mo];W[po];B[pn];W[qo];B[ml];W[rn];B[pk]TR[hq][ho]C[Through B99, White turns body around successfully, and White's two marked stones W52 and W56 still have some aji left.];W[ic]C[The most important is, Black ends in gote and White gets to jump with W100, Black instantly becomes passive.];B[ge];W[he]
;B[gf];W[gd];B[fd];W[ig];B[gc];W[id];B[jb];W[ib];B[hg];W[ih];B[if];W[jf]C[B109 and B111: Black perhaps overlooks White's good move of W114.];B[hf]LB[kf:a]C[B115: If Black takes at 'a', it will form a ko fight, Black is also not good.]
;W[kf]C[But White captures Black cleanly with W116, Black's situation is already very bad.];B[db];W[dq];B[er]C[Following B119, Black clearly has no mindset to continue the game.];W[fp];B[ep];W[do];B[cn];W[eo];B[gp];W[en];B[fn]

;B[co];W[cp];B[bn];W[bq];B[ao];W[gl]C[Through W146, Black already can't continue the game.])
