;B[ip];W[pn]C[W8 is a popular play nowadays.];B[qo];W[qj]LB[qn:a][po:b][on:c][pj:d]C[If W10 at 'a', then B 'b' and W 'c', next Black can play the extension and pincer move of B 'd', White is a little dissatisfied.];B[po];W[qg]C[W12 is a steady play and also have the purpose of obtaining sente.];B[mc];W[fc]
;B[on]LB[ci:a]C[Although B15 is a solid play but was criticized by high professional players in the study room, because next Black doesn't have any good attacking point to the two white stones on the right side. For Black to split at 'a' is more substantial.];W[ci];B[qe]C[B17 is a good defensive and offensive point, so far both sides have played very steadily.];W[kc]C[Through 18, White's tempo is very fast.];B[ke]C[B19 is a momentum play but takes a big risk and may come to nothing. Normally Black will enclose territory at the bottom.];W[id]LB[kq:a]C[W20: Awaji Shuzo 9p thinks that for White to invade at 20 is also playable.];B[dj]C[The reduction of B21 and B19 are correlated moves.];W[di]
;B[ej];W[ei];B[fj]C[Through 25, Black has formed a moyo in the center, and White also has gained some territory.];W[kq]C[The invasion of W26 is inevitable.];B[jq];W[ko];B[jn];W[kn]LB[lm:a]C[W30: Now White dares not make the knight's move at 'a', otherwise Black would immediately push and cut at 30.];B[jm]TR[dj][ej][fj]C[After Black sticks his head out with B31, it can be easily seen that the position of the marked three stones is not good.]
;W[jr];B[ir];W[mq];B[cj];W[dr]C[Through 36, White has gained some territory, but Black is very thick, the situation is still not clear. Now Choi Cheolhan is pondering, to destroy White's moyo in the upper left is imperative.];B[cf]TR[ci][di][ei]C[B37 is strong and unyielding, because the marked three white stones are relatively weak, therefore, as to B37, White doesn't any have severe attacking maneuver.];W[fi]C[W38: White first reinforces himself, watching how Black to act.];B[cd]LB[cc:a]C[B39 is the strongest resistance, if Black enters the corner at 'a', although it will lead to an exchange but that's not to Black's advantage.]
;W[cc];B[de];W[bd];B[be]C[Through 43, it forms a complicated ko fight.];W[ce];B[qk]LB[cd:a]C[After Black plays the ko threat of B45, Kobayashi is pondering. Yu Bin 9p thinks that now if White connects at 'a', White is no bad, if White answers on the right side, the number of Black's ko threats will become more and more, thus White can't win this ko fight.];W[pj];B[cd];W[ee]C[W48 is surprisingly relentless, but the risk is also very big.];B[pk];W[oj]
;B[ok];W[nj];B[nk]LB[bc:a]C[With the sequence from B49 to B53, Black directly aims at the well being of White's group at the bottom and also waits for a chance to make the ko bigger by playing at 'a'.];W[jp];B[iq];W[lr];B[js];W[nr]LB[or:a]C[As to W58, Zhou Heyang 9p thinks that it is better than the knight's move at 'a', the shape of W58 is better.];B[lp]LB[mo:a][bc:b]C[As to B59, if White plays the cap at 'a', Black will incur some losses. But Yu Bin 9p thinks this move is typical of Korean style: dare pay price first. This move aims to make the ko threat here bigger, then Black will initiate the big ko fight by playing at 'b'.]
;W[pr];B[ef]LB[bc:a]C[B61: Due to the reason of ko threats, Black gives up the fierce move at 'a'.];W[ce];B[oq];W[or];B[cd];W[ed];B[gf];W[hh];B[ie];W[ce];B[hd]
;W[hc];B[cd];W[gj]C[Through 74, Awaji Shuzo 9p thinks that, so far although the situation is a little chaotic, but Kobayashi's situation is not bad, and Black's play is very positive.];B[gk];W[ce];B[df];W[hj];B[mj];W[mi];B[li];W[lj];B[mk];W[lh]
;B[ki];W[kh];B[mh];W[ni];B[kj];W[jh];B[mg];W[lf]C[From B79 to W92, it leads to an eye-dazzling fierce fight.];B[og];W[oh];B[ic];W[jd];B[je]C[With B95 and B97, Black strengthens himself first.]
;W[he]LB[gd:a][ge:b]C[W98 is strong, next if B 'a', then W 'b', Black is no good.];B[hf];W[gd];B[ig];W[jj];B[kd];W[jc];B[ji]C[Through 105, Black and White have tangled together, but in the process, White hasn't incurred any loss, Zhang Wendong 9p thinks that now White is leading in territory.];W[kk];B[lk]LB[ii:a][ih:b][mf:c]C[If B107 at 'a', then W 'b', next W 'c' and W 107 become miai, Black is no good.]
;W[ii];B[lj];W[ih];B[mf];W[pg];B[rf];W[rg];B[of];W[hk]C[W116 is a thick play.];B[rj];W[ri];B[rk];W[si]
;B[qr];W[no];B[kr];W[kp];B[eq]LB[fr:a]C[B125: In sente, Black wants to prevent White from attaching at 'a'.];W[dq];B[lc]C[B127 is the game-deciding move.];W[gl]C[After W128, Black is not comfortable.];B[dm];W[le]LB[ff:a]C[W130 is an asking move, aiming at the wedge at 'a'.]
;B[lg]C[B131 is a desperate fighting move while the situation is still not clear.];W[kf];B[kg];W[jg];B[jf];W[ff];B[fg];W[fe];B[gg];W[eg];B[gi];W[gh];B[eh]
;W[ld];B[if];W[bi]C[W146 is a good move to look after both sides.];B[dg];W[fm]LB[fn:a]C[W148 is no better than a move at 'a'.];B[dn];W[cm]LB[do:a]C[W150: White certainly should play at 'a', Black can't make life, White gives up the chance to win the game at one stroke, it is very pitiful.];B[nh];W[pi]
;B[fn]LB[eo:a][ep:b]C[B153 is the right move, if Black makes the diagonal's extension at 'a', then White would push at 'b', Black is no good.];W[dl];B[el];W[ck];B[em];W[bj]C[Through W158, amazingly Black has escaped from the tiger's mouth. Pros in the study room think that White is still leading in the game, but the situation is already very close.];B[fk];W[nn]LB[hm:a]C[W160 perhaps should be at 'a'.];B[hl]

;B[lb];W[pm];B[qn];W[bf];B[cd];W[ae]C[W180: White gives up the ko fight, it is due to the favorable consciousness.];B[ia];W[ib];B[ka];W[ha];B[dk];W[cl];B[er]
;W[eo];B[fo];W[im];B[hn];W[pf];B[pe];W[ce]LB[es:a]C[W194: White perhaps should play the counter-sente three point move at 'a'.];B[ds];W[cs];B[es];W[cr];B[bg]

;B[ho];W[ls];B[ks];W[ge];B[md];W[kl];B[mm]C[B245 is the winning move. Because of White's small mistakes in endgame, Black luckily wins the game by half point.];W[km];B[ml];W[mn];B[jb];W[ia];B[ss]
