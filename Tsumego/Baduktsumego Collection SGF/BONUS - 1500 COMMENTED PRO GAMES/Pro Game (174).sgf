;W[cl];B[ce];W[co];B[jq];W[dn];B[mq]C[The opening is very steady for both sides, the game is very slow and they have only played total 11 moves in the first hour. ];W[qn];B[oc];W[hq];B[pr];W[qk];B[cj];W[ic]
;B[gc];W[lc];B[qj]C[The attachment was generally regarded as a crude play in the past, nowadays it has been acknowledged broadly, and is a favorite move of Korean players, Lee Changho has no exception.];W[pk];B[ph];W[ch];B[cq]C[The placement of B25 in the corner seeks to make life, Zhou looks clearly painful.];W[dq];B[cm];W[dm];B[bl];W[ck]C[Time for lunch break.]
;B[bo]LB[bk:a]C[If B31 crawls at 'a', White can stand at 31, Black can not be satisfied.];W[bk];B[cp];W[do];B[dr];W[er]C[After a deep meditation, in the end Zhou 9p is reluctant but has to let Black live in the corner.];B[cr]C[With the result to 37, Black can be satisfied.];W[qf]C[In return, W38 can only choose to wreck Black's territory.];B[rk];W[rl]
;B[pf]LB[og:a][pe:b]C[If B41 diagonals at 'a', White can counteract with his own diagonal at 'b', Black is no good. In the game, B41 is tough and unyielding.];W[qe];B[pd]C[B43 is ferocious and ruthless.];W[pe];B[oe];W[pg];B[of];W[qh];B[og];W[qg]LB[pi:a][rg:b][qi:c]C[W50 is questionable, it should atari at 'a', followed by Black's taking at 50, W 'b', B 'c' and White's taking the ko at 46, ko threats are to White's advantage.]
;B[pj]C[Black is unrelenting and continues to chase and attack.];W[pi];B[oj];W[oi];B[nj]LB[ni:a][nh:b][oh:c][qi:d]C[If B55 hanes at 'a', then W 'a' can counter hane, followed by B 'c' and W 'd', Black is no good.];W[ni];B[mi];W[mh];B[lh]C[The double hane is very powerful, the game fits Lee Changho's pace and he has the upper hand.]
;W[mg];B[nh];W[oh];B[ng];W[qi];B[ri];W[nd];B[od];W[mj];B[li];W[mk]C[White first separates Black to look for chances.];B[ol]C[After B71, White fails in the fight.]
;W[rd]C[White has no choice but to live in gote.];B[rc];W[se];B[pm];W[mm]LB[ql:a][ml:b]C[If W76 links his stones at 'a', then B 'b', White is no good either.];B[ql];W[mf];B[rh];W[rg];B[sc]
;W[qb]C[W82 is a good sequence.];B[qc];W[sg];B[rm]LB[sk:a][rj:b]C[If B85 tenukis, then White can atari at 'a', followed by Black's connecting at 'a' and White's drawing back at 85, Black is still not completely alive.];W[mp];B[nq];W[lp];B[lq];W[jp];B[np]C[Through 91, Black is apparently leading in territory, White can only fight hard with Black in the center and try to come up with adequate territory.]
;W[hg]C[W92 has to surround the center territory at a large scale, otherwise White can not compete with Black's territory on the whole board.];B[kf];W[nc];B[nb];W[mb]LB[ob:a]C[It looks as if W96 should first cut at 'a'.];B[ne]C[B97 looks clumsy but in reality is a very clever move, White is hard to respond.];W[le]C[W98 cannot help but to give way, White suffers dearly.];B[md];W[if]LB[mc:a][ld:b]C[W100 also has to reinforce, if instead White connects at 'a', Black can push through at 'b'.]
;B[ip]C[When W101 hanes out, White could not resist and has to yield, White's territorial framework in the center becomes smaller and smaller.];W[jo]LB[iq:a][kp:b][ko:c][jn:d][ll:e][ml:f][lm:g]C[If W102 cutting at 'a', then Black could atari at 'b', followed by W 102, B 'c', W 'd',  B 'e', W 'f' and B 'g', White is no good.];B[iq];W[io];B[hp];W[df]LB[ho:a][dg:b]C[If W106 pressing at 'a', then Black will play at 'b'.]
;B[ho];W[hn];B[gn];W[go]C[W110 is too unreasonable, it obviously shows that White wants to play the most ruthless move to win.];B[fo];W[gp];B[ln]C[B113 is a good move.];W[mn];B[ll];W[ml];B[in];W[hm]
;B[jn];W[mo];B[fp];W[gm]LB[gq:a][fn:b][fq:c][il:d][kj:e]C[If W122 makes the connection at 'a', followed by B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 122 and B 'e', Black's big dragon in the lower right is dangerous.];B[gq];W[on];B[pn];W[kk]C[W126 reinforcing himself can not be omitted.]
;B[de];W[ef];B[ld]C[The endgame plays following B129 are very brilliant.];W[ke];B[kd];W[jd];B[jc];W[id];B[bg]C[For W135 to grab the lower right corner is huge, the play in the game aims at White's thinness in the center.];W[bf]LB[oo:a][kc:b]C[W136 can also be played at 'a' or 'b'.]
;B[cf];W[cg];B[bh];W[bi];B[je];W[jf];B[be];W[oo]C[White has no alternatives but to ignore the left side, otherwise if White in the lower right corner gets killed, then Black takes profit on the left with sente.];B[ci];W[bj];B[fg]C[B147 is a tesuji, delivering White the final blow.];W[ff]C[The sequence after 148 is inevitable for both sides.]
;B[dg];W[dh];B[eg];W[ei];B[fm];W[fl];B[gf];W[fe];B[ge];W[fd];B[gd];W[gg];B[gl]C[Black attacks from all directions, White can not avoid suffering devastation, the game for White is pratically over.]
;W[hl]LB[em:a][fh:b]C[If W162 ataris at 'a', then B 'b', White is no good.];B[fc];W[fh];B[el]C[After B165, White already has no chance of winning.];W[fk];B[em];W[dl];B[ek];W[qq];B[fj]
;W[gk];B[ej];W[gj];B[me];W[lf];B[jb];W[ib];B[ed]C[Through 179, White has to concede defeat. Taking the whole game into consideration, the fight on the right was totally under Lee 9p's control, this is the reason for White's defeat. Later on Zhou 9p created some complications and fought to the last second even under a terrible sitation, but fell short to turn the game around due to the mistakes in the first half of the game. Lee Changho gets to the semi-final.])
