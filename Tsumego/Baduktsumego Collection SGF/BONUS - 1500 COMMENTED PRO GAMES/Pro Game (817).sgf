;W[ed];B[kc];W[do];B[qn];W[np];B[lq]C[Facing with the Go world #1, Lee Sedol's opening is not falling into conventional pattern.];W[fp]C[The knight's move of W12 is thick.];B[lo];W[nn];B[pm];W[qo];B[eo]C[Following B17, Black separates White strongly, "invincible youth" true character appears vividly on the board.]
;W[ep];B[dp];W[co]C[When W18 and Black cuts with B19, the descent of W20 is a strong and good move.];B[en]C[Black's moves following B21 are ferocious.];W[er];B[dr];W[cl];B[eq];W[fq];B[fr];W[gr];B[es]

;B[cj]LB[ci:a][di:b][dj:c][pj:d]C[After obtaining sente, Black immediately starts to act on the left side, which is the vital point for the game, but the selection point of B55 is a little inappropriate, for Black to make three-space extension at 'a' is better, after White plays at 55, Black can stand up at 'b', after W 'c', then Black can play on the right side at 'd', this is relatively normal.];W[bi];B[ci];W[bj];B[bh];W[ck];B[ai];W[ak];B[dh]C[Through B63, White becomes safe and also obtains precious sente.]
;W[pj]C[White attacks with the pincer of W64, Black fails.];B[ol];W[nq];B[mm];W[mn];B[ph]C[In a slightly unfavorable situation, Black first uses the exchange of B65 and B67, then counter-pincers with B69, this is a game-deciding move which makes the game chaotic.];W[cg];B[ch];W[qf];B[bp];W[bo];B[rh]
;W[mk];B[oj];W[qc]C[After White exchanges with W76 and B77, White attaches inside with W78, Lee Changho's situation judgement is really worth admiring.];B[pc]LB[pd:a]C[B79: The common move is to extend at 'a', in the real game, after B79, White cuts at 'a', Black has no answer.];W[pd];B[rd]C[Following B81, Black clearly has no time to thick carefully, however White uses his excellent basic skill and negates Black's attack at one stroke.];W[rc];B[rb];W[qb];B[pb];W[ra]
