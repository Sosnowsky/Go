;B[ce];W[di]C[The three-space pincer of W6 is a favorite play of Yu Bin 9p.];B[fe];W[fc];B[cc]LB[dk:a]C[B9 sliding underneath to the corner is seldom seen nowadays. A pincer at 'a' is common. This also shows Cho 9p's ardent love for territory.];W[de]C[The attachment of W10 is inevitable.];B[cd];W[ee];B[cn];W[od]LB[dg:a][nc:b][cf:c]C[Although W14 approaching the corner is a big point, but due to severeness of Black's knight move at 'a', I prefer W14 jumping to 'a'. If Black tenukis and protects the corner around 'b', White can tiger at 'a' and settle the shape with sente, White is very thick. If Black instead extends to 'c' in reply to W 'a', then White can approach the corner at 14, this is clearly better than the real game.]
;B[np];W[qn];B[dg];W[ff]LB[eg:a][eh:b][dh:c][cg:d]C[The hane of W18 does not have any choice, if W18 attaches at 'a', then B 'b' hanes out, W 'c' cuts and B 'd' stands, White is in a bitter battle.];B[dh];W[ci];B[bh];W[fi]C[Through 22 in the game, Black gains some points with sente.];B[mc]
;W[ob];B[pf];W[ne];B[qi];W[kc];B[jq];W[ke];B[ql];W[lq]LB[en:a]C[The invasion of W32 is somewhat unreasonable, capping at 'a' is the proper move.];B[po];W[qo];B[pp]C[B33 and B35 are good moves, White is very difficult to handle.]
;W[qm]LB[qp:a][pr:b]C[If W36 connects at 'a', Black will jump to 'b', White is not comfortable either.];B[qp];W[rp];B[pq];W[qr];B[ro];W[rq];B[pm];W[rl];B[pn];W[qk]
;B[pl];W[rm];B[jo]TR[lq]C[Black has built a thick wall, with Black jumping to 49, the marked white stone passes away peacefully. Black takes the lead.];W[en];B[do]LB[ep:a]C[The diagonal of B51 is infrequent, instead the diagonal move at 'a' is common.];W[dr];B[er];W[eq];B[ep];W[fq]
;B[cr]C[The sequence from B53 to B57 is very profitable.];W[fr];B[ds];W[gn];B[fp];W[nq];B[nr];W[gp];B[jl]C[B65 does not tangle too much at the bottom, it's a good play by taking the whole situation into account.];W[hq];B[ip];W[hm]
;B[jj]LB[in:a]C[B69 is not meticulous, Black should first diagonal at 'a' with sente then make the two-space jump to 69.];W[jm]C[The leaning cut at W70 is alert, White must find some breakthroughs here.];B[km];W[jn];B[kn];W[ko];B[lo];W[kp];B[jp];W[lp]LB[kl:a]C[W78 seems a damaging move, cutting directly at 'a' may be even better.]

;W[hg];B[kh];W[jg]C[W104 and W106 has completely surrounded the territory at the top, the game becomes closer.];B[kg];W[kf];B[mh];W[nh];B[mg];W[pg];B[qg];W[of];B[pc];W[oc]
;B[ni];W[nj];B[oi];W[pk];B[og]LB[db:a][eb:b][dd:c][ed:d]C[The cut of B121 is almost the losing move. It is too small! it should absolutely hane at 'a', then W 'b' blocks, B 'c' pushes through, W 'd' and Black takes the ko. Because Black is thick everywhere, White has to compromise!];W[pe];B[qf];W[db]C[After W124 stands, the game has been turned around.];B[me]

;B[cm];W[bl];B[bn];W[rj];B[jh]C[B143 is very treacherous, gaining some points by using White's consciousness of leading the game.];W[ig]LB[ih:a][ld:b]C[W144 should hang at 'a', the atari at 'b' for Black does not work at all.];B[mf];W[ld];B[cl];W[bk]
;B[bg];W[an];B[ao];W[am];B[bo];W[oj];B[pj];W[nf];B[ng];W[qj];B[pi];W[sg]LB[fk:a]C[The large knight's move of W160 is a big losing move! White has completely neglected that White's group at the bottom has life and death problem, if W160 was played as the turn at 'a', it will be a half point game.]
;B[fg];W[gg];B[ef];W[gf];B[ej]C[B165 is sharp! it cuts White into two parts with sente.];W[ek];B[dj];W[cj];B[dk];W[ei];B[fo];W[fn];B[gr]C[After B173, it results in a ko killing, White could not afford to answer any ko threat, after the exchange, Black is leading about 10 points on the board.]
