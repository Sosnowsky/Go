Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[This is the game between Zhou Heyang 9p and Ko geuntae 4p, Zhou Heyang played pretty well in this game and his opponent didn't get any good chance.];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[fc]
;W[cf];B[db];W[cc];B[ic];W[oc];B[pe];W[qk];B[qi];W[qo];B[pc]C[The opening of B11 and B15 is slow, with B11 Black should directly make the diagonal hit at 15, this shape appeared many times in the games between Teacher Nie Weiping and Teacher Cho Hunhyun. In the real game, after B11 and B15, W10 becomes light.];W[mq];B[op];W[rq]
;B[no]C[B19 is also slow, after White flies to the second line, Black is not sure how to answer. However, White's shape on the right side is very good, White is successful in the opening.];W[pm];B[lp];W[kq];B[jp];W[jq]LB[kp:a][ko:b][lo:c]C[W22 and W24 crawling over are simple and clear. With W24 White can also consider to push at 'a', after Black blocks at 'b', White can cut at 'c', this variation is complicated. In the real game, Zhou Heyang feels his situation is not bad, so he elects to play simply.];B[ip];W[iq];B[hp]
;W[hq];B[gp];W[fq];B[do];W[co];B[cp]LB[gq:a][gr:b][eq:c]C[B31 and B33 are good moves! Since Black has the tactic of B 'a', W 'b' and B 'c', here White can't exert power. In the game, Heyang's selection is clever, although it is a little territory-damaging, the situation keeps balance, it fits Heyang's style.];W[cq];B[bp];W[ep];B[cn]
;W[eo];B[bo];W[dm];B[kp];W[cl];B[bq];W[cr];B[gq];W[gr];B[fr];W[hs];B[bl];W[bk]
;B[bm];W[kc]LB[ck:a]C[The invasion of W52 is very big. For White to connect at 'a' is too slow, at this situation, to invade the upper right corner is the biggest.];B[mc];W[mb];B[lb];W[lc];B[nb];W[kb];B[ck]LB[ib:a]C[The cut of B59 is just Black's wish, but I feel Black should double up at 'a', threatening White's big group.];W[gc]
;B[gd];W[hc];B[hd];W[ib]C[With W60, W62 and W64, White makes life very happily, Black's profit is limited.];B[ed];W[cj];B[dk];W[bi]LB[fb:a][ob:b]C[W66 and W68 are not simple and clear. White is forced to make an inefficient shape and White's gain is not big. Now White should continue to take territory at 'a', after White lives completely, White's push at 'b' will become very severe, besides, Black's big group at the top is still not alive completely, White should be very easy to control the situation.];B[en];W[er]
;B[dj];W[di];B[ei];W[ej];B[ak];W[bj];B[ek];W[fj];B[dh];W[ci];B[fk];W[gj];B[eh]
;W[de];B[ef];W[gk];B[fl];W[gh];B[cb];W[bb];B[jc]LB[bd:a][be:b][bc:c][bg:d][ab:e][dc:f][df:g][ee:h]C[B91 and B93 are not good, especially B91 looks crude and tights up his own liberty. With B91 Black should directly strike at 'a', White can only make diagonal at 'b' and can't connect at 'c', otherwise Black can make the knight's move at 'd', White can't escape. With B91 if Black strikes at 'a', then W 'b', B 'c', W 'e', B 'f', White connects and B 'g', after this exchange, White's tactic at 'h' will disappear automatically.]
;W[jb];B[fb];W[la];B[nc]LB[ee:a]C[Since Black has the defect at 'a', the role of offense and defense is switched, Black already can't attack White.];W[oi]LB[id:a][jd:b][ie:c]C[The cap of W96 is a very good move. White can also consider to play atari at 'a', next B 'b' and W 'c', sacrificing two stones W60 and W62 and taking chance to contain Black, this way White is also winning.];B[pj];W[ri];B[rj]

;W[mj]C[After W152, White's several stones in the middle all die, Black already can't overturn the game.];B[sq];W[oe];B[qf];W[sl];B[sh];W[sp];B[ro];W[pn]LB[ol:a]C[What's worth mentioning last is making-life tactic of W160 , it is a clever move. Although White can also make life in other places, but White is reluctant to make diagonal at 'a', it is too damaging. In the game, Black can use it for other purposes, the game is over.];B[rp];W[qp]
