Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[In the 31st Kisei title match 1, Yamashita Keigo 9p defeated Kobayashi Satoru 9p by resignation, taking 1:0 lead in best-of-7 series. ];W[dd];B[pq];W[oc];B[dp]
;W[po];B[ld];W[me]C[W8 is rarely seen and an ancient play.];B[pf]LB[od:a]C[As to this, for Black to attach at 'a' is joseki. In the game, the variation of B9 seems not good.];W[qh]LB[qc:a]C[W10: White should attach at 'a', which is the vital point.];B[og]LB[pc:a][od:b][qf:c]C[B11: Black should make diagonal at 'a', next W 'b' and B 'c'.]
;W[pd]LB[qc:a][qe:b]C[W12 is White's first step to defeat, why not attaching at 'a'? Perhaps White didn't expect the intense play of B 'a'. But even if Black retreats at 'b', it will be the same result as White directly attaches at 'a'.];B[qc];W[qe];B[pe];W[re];B[nd];W[pb];B[nc];W[od];B[oe]C[B21: Black tightens liberty. Since Black can fight by sacrificing, even if the corner is being killed, it is not big. White is not comfortable.]
;W[nb];B[mb];W[qb];B[rb];W[rc];B[rd];W[sd];B[sc];W[se];B[qm];W[qf]LB[ne:a]C[W32: White stresses on the severeness of the cut at 'a'.];B[qa]
;W[oa]LB[pa:a][na:b]C[W34: White is tenacious. If White blocks at 'a', Black will play atari at 'a', White can't connect.];B[ne];W[qq];B[qg]C[B37 making a ko is a little early. Since White also didn't reinforce, Black can wait for better chances.];W[rg];B[ph];W[pi]LB[pg:a][qi:b]C[W40 is good move! If White takes at 'a' first, Black will play double hane at 'b', White is not good.];B[qp]C[B41: Black makes ko threat.]
;W[pg];B[pp];W[oh]C[W42 and W44 are simple and clear, the value of these two moves is very big. The exchange is not to Black's advantage.];B[rc];W[pc];B[na]C[B47: Black is very brave, however Black takes a big risk for this small advantage.];W[ma];B[la]C[After this move, the game was closed for the first day.];W[qo];B[rp];W[pa]LB[fq:a]C[W52 is weak, the ko value is worth total 30 points, Black needs two moves to capture cleanly, White can first take the super huge point at 'a' and then fight the ko with Black, Black will be very painful.]
;B[fq];W[ck];B[oo];W[fc]LB[jp:a]C[W56: White wants to play at 'a'.];B[jp]C[Because after B57, Black's shape at bottom is too beautiful.];W[cn];B[be];W[cd];B[ci];W[cf];B[co]
;W[dn];B[fo];W[ek]LB[ej:a]C[W66: For White to make knight at 'a' is more positive.];B[bk];W[cl];B[ei];W[dh];B[di];W[ch];B[bi]LB[gi:a]C[B73 is overplay, to stick head out at 'a' is the original move.]
;W[gj];B[eh];W[gh]C[W74 and W76 are severe, Black is not comfortable.];B[gg];W[hg];B[df];W[eg]C[W80: White forces Black to escape in a narrow route and gains a lot of profit.];B[fh];W[fg];B[gf];W[dg];B[gi]
;W[hh];B[hi];W[fj];B[fi];W[ik]LB[hf:a]C[But next W90 is slow, the left side is not difficult to handle, to capture two stones at 'a' is bigger, this way Black is not easy to play.];B[hf]C[B91: Black escapes and also pins down White.];W[jg];B[ij];W[jk];B[jh];W[ig]
;B[ie];W[kh];B[ki];W[jj];B[ji];W[lh];B[li];W[mh];B[lk]C[Through B105, Black handles well on both sides, White instead has only played some dame moves, Black is favorable.];W[hj]LB[lb:a]C[White first plays atari with W106 and is not wasting ko threat. If White initiates the ko at 'a', W106 becomes small, Black can ignore.];B[ii]
;W[lb]C[However, it is still unreasonable for White to initiate the ko.];B[na]C[Perhaps Kobayashi Satoru already has no mindset to continue the game.];W[mj];B[mi];W[ma];B[kf];W[kg];B[na];W[ni];B[ng];W[nh];B[mk]
;W[ma];B[ce]C[Since Black has ko threat of B121, White clearly can't win the ko.];W[de];B[na];W[kk];B[ef];W[ff];B[lj];W[ma];B[fe];W[ee];B[na];W[ra]C[Through W132, White retreats and almost loses one move, White's situation is already very bad.]
