;W[cg]LB[cj:a]C[W6: White usually will extend on the side at around 'a', the large-knight corner enclosure is a new trend.];B[jd];W[qf];B[nc];W[qi];B[nq];W[qn];B[pr];W[dl];B[cc]C[B15: Black is alert and enters the corner directly at the 3-3 point.];W[dc]

;W[ee]C[After White reinforces with W30, Black has obtained a big territory with sente.];B[qq]TR[jd]C[Black already takes the vital point with the marked black stone and is not fearful of White's expansion, so Black grabs another vital point with B31, Black's tempo is not bad.];W[nn];B[oj];W[oi];B[ni];W[nj]
(;B[ok]LB[pi:a][oh:b][ph:c][mj:d]C[The simple extension of B37 is a brave move. Black usually would atari at 'a', then W 'b', B 37, W 'c' and B 'd', White can be satisfied (see var a).];W[mi];B[nh];W[oh];B[on]LB[nm:a][nk:b]C[B41 is a clever move! if Black attaches at 'a', then White would press at 'b', Black has no go answer.];W[om];B[nm]
;W[nl];B[nk];W[mj];B[mm];W[ol];B[mk];W[ml];B[lk];W[ll];B[ng]C[B53 is the vital point.];W[lh];B[qj];W[rj]
;B[qk]C[B55 and B57: Black not only destroys White's territory and also takes care of his own eye space, Black is favorable.];W[lf];B[ri];W[qh];B[of];W[pe]LB[rk:a][rl:b][rh:c]C[W62: White normally should crawl at 'a', then B 'b' and W 'c', White makes life.];B[oe];W[qd]LB[rd:a][od:b]C[W62 and W64: Although White obtains sente, but the play is rather vulgar, after Black ataris and connects with B 'a' and B 'b', White loses a lot of territory and also Black becomes very thick.]
;B[qc];W[rk];B[rl];W[rh];B[rd];W[qe];B[od];W[ld];B[kl]LB[lc:a]C[B73 is a cowardly move. Black should bridge over at 'a', it is still too early for White to kill Black's big dragon.];W[kk]LB[lb:a]C[W74: White's strategy is correct. Now a huge move at 'a' is left at the top, even if White suffers some losses locally, White must obtain sente.]
;B[lj];W[km];B[jl];W[jk]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.];B[li];W[kh];B[mh]LB[ik:a][jj:b]C[B81 is a wrong sequence play, Black should first play at 'a', after White draws back at 'b', then B 81.];W[lb]C[W82 is huge.];B[ik];W[ii]C[W84 is the proper play, White has to fight by sacrificing, because of White's conservative, White has paid a dear price!]
