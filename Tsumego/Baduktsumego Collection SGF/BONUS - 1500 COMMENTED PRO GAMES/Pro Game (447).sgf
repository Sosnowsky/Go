The final was held between two young Korean pros, it was unexpected, because Lee Changho was not in a good state recently, we failed to see the wonderful "Two Lee" match in the final.];W[dp]C[White is Lee Sedol 7p of Korea.];B[pq];W[dd];B[fq]

;B[om];W[pk]C[The opening through 20 was once very popular, the key for this opening lies in whether Black can enclose territory at the bottom.];B[fc];W[hc]C[In response to the corner approach of B21, the one-space lower pincer looks like Lee Sedol's favorite play.];B[cc];W[dc];B[cd];W[de];B[db];W[eb];B[cb];W[ec]
;B[cf];W[qf];B[qi];W[qk];B[pf]C[As to the corner approach of W32, after the exchange of B33 and W34, Black becomes thin at the bottom, so the stone W32 can be handled lightly.];W[pg];B[qe];W[of];B[pe];W[kc]C[White leisurely makes the two-space extension with W40 to avoid tangling with Black, with this move White has taken the whole game into consideration.];B[qg]C[B41: From the state of mind, Black should cut and capture.];W[lq]C[After the invasion of W42, Black is difficult.]
;B[lp]C[In the game, with the sequence after B43, Black has no choice but to kill White's big group. As to the current position, I once played this as White, Chang Hao also once played this shape while taking White in the Samsung semi-finals and defeated Lee Changho in the end, it seems Black is taking a big risk. Here the variation for Black is quite complicated, and White has the possibility of fighting by sacrifice.];W[mp];B[lo];W[jq];B[iq];W[kq];B[ir];W[qh];B[rf];W[nr];B[no];W[pr];B[qr]
;W[oq];B[np];W[mq];B[ks]C[B53, B57 and B59 are regarded to be the strongest moves after study in the past.];W[ls];B[ms];W[mo];B[mn];W[ln];B[kn];W[lm];B[mm];W[js]
;B[lr];W[ip]C[After White pushes and separates Black with W62 and cuts again at 70, White has too many things to take care of.];B[jo];W[hp];B[gq]LB[gr:a]C[When White extends with W72, Black doubles up at 73, White on the side already becomes ko-alive, moreover White has plentiful of ko threats, after the ko fight, Black's big group on the right is still not alive. With B73, no matter what Black should make the diagonal's extension at 'a', this way White itself would die unconditionally, although the variation is complicated, but I feel that even if playing like this, Black would still be fraught with grim possibilities.];W[ll];B[jl];W[op];B[oo];W[ps];B[or]
;W[kr]C[In fact, when White ataris with W80, the game is already over.];B[nq]LB[ls:a]C[B81: If Black connects at 'a', White would make eyes at 81, Black's four stones would connect-and-die, in the game it equals to that White has won the ko fight unconditionally.];W[ls];B[pm];W[qm];B[ks];W[jm];B[im];W[ls];B[ml];W[lk]
;B[ks];W[in];B[km];W[ls];B[hn];W[mr]LB[kp:a]C[W96: White can also consider to first push at 'a', the play in the game is also fine.];B[dr];W[kp];B[pp]C[B99: Black still need one more move to make life, so far, Black is already losing terribly. However in the ensuing fights, White's play is still very active.];W[ch];B[cg]

;W[bm];B[bh]LB[am:a][co:b]C[B129: For Black to play the hane at 'a' is the only chance, but White can connect and live by playing at 'b', the outcome of the game can't be altered.];W[di];B[cj];W[hk]C[After White's clamp of W132, Black is very painful.];B[gk];W[ik];B[il];W[gj];B[fj]

In this game, Lee Sedol easily defeated his opponent by brilliant offense and defense and won back-to-back champions, it is worth congratulation, however at the age of 17, Song TaeKon can beat Lee Changho in the semi final, his strength is also exceptional, he is definitely not a player that can be underestimated in the future.];B[hd];W[ef];B[ic];W[hb];B[jc];W[gd];B[ie];W[ge];B[kd]
