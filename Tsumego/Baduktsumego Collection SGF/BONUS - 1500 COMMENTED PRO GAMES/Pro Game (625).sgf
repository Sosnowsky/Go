(;SZ[19]EV[Korea 46th Guksu challenger final game 2]DT[2002-12-09]PC[Korea]KM[6.5]PB[Cho Hunhyun]BR[9p]PW[Jo HanSeung]WR[5p]RE[W+R]C[Commentary by Wang Lei 8p, Source: China Sports Weekly, Translation: GoGameWorld.com.];B[pd]C[On Dec. 9th, in game 2 of challenger final best of three games, Cho Hunhyun unexpectedly suffered a crushing defeat in the middle game, Jo HanSeung won the series 2:0 and becomes the final challenger to the current title holder Lee Changho. Recently Cho Hunhyun's game schedules are too crowded, which must be the reason why in this game he has underperformed.];W[dd];B[qp];W[dq] 
;B[do];W[oq];B[fp]C[The cap at B7 is a favorite play of Cho 9p. Jo HanSeung's style is very thick, generally speaking, people with this style more stress on defense and do not like to attack on own initiative.];W[qf];B[mp];W[fq];B[gp];W[co];B[dp];W[cp];B[cq];W[dr];B[cn] 
;W[bq];B[dm];W[gq];B[hp];W[cg]LB[nc:a]C[If it were played by an attack-style player, W22 will be most likely played as the double approach move at 'a' to attack first.];B[op]LB[qh:a]C[Although B23 is a very thick move, but it is not like Cho's style! B23 should pincer at 'a' to achieve highest efficiency and fully utilize thickness.];W[qi]C[The two-space extension at 24 is an absolutely perfect point, the power of Black's thickness has been greatly restrained.];B[nc];W[pq]C[The sequence after W26 makes life in the corner, Black's thickness obviously falls apart.] 
;B[pp];W[mq];B[lq];W[nq];B[lp];W[qq];B[rp];W[rq];B[pk]C[B35 playing on the fourth line is ingenious and aims to cultivate the center.];W[rd];B[fc];W[hc]LB[dc:a]C[In response to the corner approach of B37, the pincer-attack of B38 is somewhat emotion-driven but not very substantial, W38 doubling up at 'a' is better.] 
;B[cc]C[The sequence following B39 lives in the corner with sente, it's too big!];W[dc];B[cd];W[de];B[db];W[eb];B[cb];W[ec];B[ce];W[cf];B[ef];W[df];B[kc] 
;W[jd]C[W52 is a good move! Because Black's center is vast and far from closing in, so direct reduction is no better than slow invasion.];B[jc];W[kd];B[id]LB[ld:a]C[The counter-attack of B55 is the typical move of Cho's style! though at this time there is nothing wrong to play at 'a' in reply, but whenever there is a chance to start a fight and only if it is not too unreasonable, Cho 9p would not think twice. However, to be honest, B55 is still somewhat unreasonable.];W[ic];B[ie];W[jf]C[The jump of W58 is very tight!];B[je]C[The push and cut at B59 has no way to back down.];W[ke];B[kf] 
;W[le]C[W62 is a not-easily-found good move! Cho Hunhyun may has overlooked this play.];B[lf];W[me];B[jg]LB[lc:a][if:b]C[B63 and B65 have no other choices, if pulling back at 'a', after White presses at 'b', Black is dangerous.];W[lc]C[After W66 hanes, White can be satisfied.];B[pf];W[pg];B[lb];W[kb];B[jb]

;B[qe];W[oh];B[ng];W[rf];B[re];W[qh];B[se];W[oj]C[Black has obtained the corner by sacrificing, but W92 sticking out is extremely valuable, White is better off.];B[ni];W[ok];B[qk];W[oi];B[mk] 
;W[pb];B[pc];W[np]C[The exchange after W100 does not favor White originally, but nobody expects this move in fact has planted the foreshadowing for victory!];B[no];W[nn];B[on];W[om];B[nm];W[nl];B[mn];W[ml];B[lk] 
;W[fi]LB[hi:a][na:b]C[After W100, if Black plays the cap move at 'a', the game is far from over, but at this juncture Cho Hunhyun is like one possessed and plays at 'b'!];B[na]LB[if:a][ib:b][gi:c][lh:d][ki:e]C[B111 was an absolute sente move, but now Jo can pull out at 'a' by using 110 as the ladder breaker, then reinforce at 'b', at a glance it seems Black can attach out to fight, but White 'd' and 'e' can completely immoblize Black.];W[if];B[hf];W[ig];B[hg] 
;W[ih];B[he];W[ib];B[gi];W[lh];B[nh];W[ki];B[jh];W[ii];B[li]C[B123 and B125 can only hold out tenaciously to kill White's big dragon, while White itself is full of flaws...];W[gj]C[After W126 hanes, afterwards Black has to accomplish a task that could not be done.];B[md] 
;W[ja];B[hi];W[ij];B[hj];W[hk];B[ik];W[kj];B[fh];W[il];B[ll];W[jk];B[fj];W[gk] 
;B[ei];W[lj];B[mj];W[mi];B[nj];W[lm];B[km];W[mm];B[kl];W[kg]C[After W150 completely lives, Black has been defeated utterly.];B[bi];W[ci];B[cj]
