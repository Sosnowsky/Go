Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[It was a long time since I commented my own game last time. In the round 1 of 1st Lanke Cup, my opponent is Zhou Heyang 9p.];W[pp];B[dc];W[cp];B[nq]
;W[qn];B[ep];W[eq];B[fq];W[dq];B[ce]C[The opening from B5 to B11 is trend, the purpose is to disrupt recently popular openings.];W[kp];B[oc]C[As to the pincer of W12, Black elects to defend two corners with B13 and Black can adequately fight.];W[ph]LB[pq:a]C[W14: White has the state of mind to play at around 'a'.];B[pr];W[qq]LB[oq:a]C[W16: White should consider to answer at 'a', this way to relate with W14, White's shape is vivid.]
;B[op];W[oo];B[no];W[on];B[pq];W[qp];B[kr]C[In the game, Black settles down from B15 to B23, Black is successful in the opening.];W[qf];B[jc];W[fp]TR[kr]C[Due to the existence of B23 (the marked stone), the cut of W26 appears insipid.];B[cj]
;W[cl];B[ff]C[After B27 and B29, Black is vivid on the board.];W[je];B[ng]C[As to the cap of W30, the counterattack of B31 is inevitable.];W[db]C[W32 is a probe.];B[ec];W[oe]C[Then White pounds on Black with W34.];B[ne];W[of];B[nd];W[pc]
;B[qc]C[However, after B35 to B39, White has no severe follow-up tactic.];W[ic]TR[je]C[In the center, for White to escape W30 alone appears tasteless, so White attaches with W40 to create thread.];B[id];W[jd];B[kc];W[nf]LB[hc:a]C[After leaving the aji of extension at 'a', White pushes and cuts Black with W44.];B[mf];W[mg];B[lf]LB[lg:a][mh:b][lh:c][pd:d][pb:e][ob:f]C[B47: If Black plays atari at 'a', after W 'b', B 'c' is a momentum play, but Black doesn't like White's retreat at 'd' then cut at 'f'. In the game, Black didn't elect to play this way since Black judges his situation is favorable.]
;W[mh];B[hd]C[However, following W40 White incurs loss in the first place, Black can simply answer with B47 and B49, the top becomes territory.];W[cc];B[bc];W[kh];B[qj]C[B53 is a probe.];W[pd];B[pb];W[ob];B[qb];W[ld]C[With W54 to W58, White is alert!];B[jf]
;W[ie];B[ig]C[The counterattack of B59 and B61 is inevitable.];W[hg];B[hh];W[gg]C[W62 and W64 are also the strongest resistance.];B[ih]C[Here Black has many more choices.];W[fd]C[Following W66, the situation is not clear for both sides.];B[he];W[cd];B[bd];W[dd]
;B[de];W[ed];B[eb]LB[gc:a]C[B71 and B73 are hasty moves, now Black should pincer at 'a' calmly, allowing White escape the left side but Black captures the right side, this way Black is clearly favorable.];W[hc];B[cb];W[if];B[hf];W[kd];B[gc];W[gb];B[jb];W[ia]
;B[fc];W[gd];B[fe];W[lc];B[lb];W[ka];B[mb];W[kb]C[In the game, through W90, it is also an exchange, but Black clearly incurs loss. However, now the situation is still to Black's advantage.];B[rh]LB[kg:a][oj:b][fa:c][hb:d]C[Following B91, Black seeks life, but Black's play is questionable. With B91 Black should first make diagonal at 'a', then jump to 'b' tenaciously, if White doesn't answer at 'c', Black can cut and atari at 'd', White is not alive. Black loses common sense following B91.]

;W[qm];B[nm]C[Through B129, Black incurs a big loss, the situation is not clear.];W[dj];B[di];W[dk];B[ci];W[ei];B[gq];W[fo];B[ip];W[lm];B[mn];W[kl]
;B[eh]LB[fi:a]C[Black's sequence following B141 is a little messy. With B141 Black should clamp at 'a' to fight with White, both sides have no assurance of success.];W[fi];B[fk]LB[kn:a]C[B143 is a hasty move, Black should play at 'a'.];W[hj];B[hl];W[fm];B[fl];W[gm];B[gi]LB[ij:a]C[B149 is a blunder! Black can't capture two white stones and shows a big losing trend. With B149 Black should simply attach at 'a' instead, this way the outcome of the game is still hard to guess.]
