Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[Unconsciously, here comes again the yearly China-Japan Agon Cup dual meet, this is Zhou's second time, this time his opponent is Japanese Kisei Hane Naoki, but through the whole game, Hane 9p didn't give play to his Kisei talent.];W[dc];B[pq];W[cp];B[ep]

;B[pc];W[pd];B[qb];W[rc];B[od];W[pe];B[oc];W[rb];B[hc];W[pf];B[bc];W[mc]LB[ef:a]C[In the opening, from W30, it leads to a fierce fight, but I think W28 and W30 are questionable, with W28 White should jump to 'a' before Black makes the knight's move at 29.]
;B[ld];W[me];B[oe];W[md];B[of];W[pg];B[og];W[ph]LB[mg:a][oh:b]C[As to the fight following W30, there are also a lot of questionable moves. First, a move at 'a' is a must, White doesn't try to get it but retreats with W38 steadily. With W38, White certainly should jump to 'a'! If Black dares hane at 38, White should not hesitate to cut at 'b'.];B[mg];W[le];B[jd]
;W[kf]LB[je:a][nh:b]C[W42 is the biggest questionable move. White should play at 'a', because the peep at 'b' is very severe.];B[kh];W[if];B[ge];W[ef];B[gg]C[In the game, Black separates and attacks White with B45 and B47, Black already takes control of the game.];W[jh];B[ji];W[lh];B[lg]
;W[kg];B[ki];W[ih];B[li];W[fc];B[gi];W[fh];B[gh]LB[hg:a][id:b][je:c][jc:d][jb:e]C[As to the peep of W58, B59 is slow. Black should double up at 'a', next W 'b', B 'c', W 'd' and B 'e' is tesuji, Black has a chance to win the game at one stroke.]
;W[ii]C[White makes life with the sequence from W60 to W78, over here White's play is also a little questionable.];B[ij];W[hj];B[hi];W[id];B[ic];W[lb];B[kb];W[kd]LB[je:a][oi:b][ni:c][oj:d]C[W68: White should reserve the tactic of directly making life at 'a'. White should first probe Black by playing the diagonal extension at 'b', this variation is clearly better than the real game. After initiating the ko fight, White's ko threat at 'c' is very damaging, Black gets to extend out at 'd', Black obtains a big advantage.]
;B[kc];W[je];B[ke];W[ni];B[oi];W[kd];B[hd];W[jc];B[jb];W[jd]LB[oj:a]C[W78: White should hane at 'a'.];B[oj];W[qj]C[W80 is also a big slow move! But next Black starts to play questionable moves.]
;B[cb];W[cf];B[be];W[dh];B[di];W[ei];B[ej];W[de]C[With the sequence from B81 to W88, Black helps White to make life.];B[ho]LB[bp:a][dn:b][cq:c][bo:d]C[The most inexplicable move is the set pattern following B89! With this kind of play, it seems Black is leading by 20 points on the board. The correct play of B89 is to atari at 'a', then hang at 'b', even if Black wants to make the knight's move, Black still should cut and atari at 'c', next B 'a', W 'd' and then make the knight's move. But in the real game, Hane Naoki's questionable moves help Zhou's slow moves not evolving into a big disaster.]
;W[bo];B[bp];W[cq];B[cn];W[bn];B[bm];W[bq];B[cm];W[po]LB[mi:a]C[The play following W98 is questionable. With W98, White should bump at 'a', this is weakness in Black's shape, but White seems to have ignored that.];B[ol];W[no];B[nq]
