;W[ed];B[oc];W[ch]LB[ci:a]C[W8: For White to play the three-space low pincer at 'a' is also often seen.];B[qn]LB[cm:a][ee:b]C[B9: Black's tenuki is surprising for me, because since White has played the two-space low pincer of W8, Black should make the large knight's move at 'a' or directly attach out at 'b' to initiate a fight.];W[nq];B[rp];W[qq];B[qk];W[kc]
;B[bc];W[df];B[cf];W[dg];B[cb];W[cn];B[fq];W[bp]C[Through W22, White has already opened up the situation.];B[iq]LB[cq:a]C[B23: The reason why Black elects to make the two-space extension instead of the diagonal's move at 3-3 is that Black wants to reserve the variation here and later on invade on White's left side.];W[rd]LB[ke:a]C[W24: The first feeling for White is to jump at' a' to enclose territory, in the game, White elects to attach on the second line in order to create some aji, then take tenuki to avoid heaviness.]
;B[re];W[pj]C[The shoulder-hit of W26 is "one stone two birds ", compressing Black's territory and having a good relation with White's own thickness as well.];B[qj];W[pi];B[ol];W[mj];B[ke]C[With the cap of B31, Black starts to reduce White's moyo.];W[nd]C[The counterattack of W32 is inevitable, here White can't afford to give way.];B[nc];W[md];B[pe]C[B35: Black has no good move, so Black first takes territory and see how White to play.]
;W[qf];B[qe];W[mg]C[W36: White takes advantage in sente, then connects his two groups with W38 and also cut Black's way back, so far, there is no doubt that White is favorable.];B[kh]C[B39: Black starts to escape.];W[od];B[pc];W[ih]C[W42 is the right direction for attack, removing Black's potential of making eye shapes and also forming a moyo on the left side.];B[mh];W[nh];B[lg];W[mf];B[kj]LB[mi:a]C[B47: For Black to hit at 'a' would be better, if White blocks, Black can double hane, this way it is a little crude but very practical.]
;W[ij];B[if];W[id]LB[mi:a][lh:b][lf:c][kf:d][jg:e][kg:f][hd:g]C[W50 is a move that I feel regretted about. White should first atari at 'a', after Black connects at 'b', then W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f' and W 'g', this is the right sequence. When W 'a', if Black plays tenuki, then White can make a ponnuki by playing at 'b', which is huge.];B[lf]C[B51 is a good move! At a glance, I didn't feel anything, afterwards I took a second look and found out this move is simple and substantial.];W[mc]LB[ng:a][lc:b]C[Now White faces with the severe tactics of Black's cut at 'a' and attachment at 'b', White is forced to reinforce with W52, in fact the value of this move itself is not big.]
;B[gf];W[li];B[ki];W[lh]LB[ng:a][ig:b][gh:c]C[W54 and W56 are the losing moves. In the game, I always feel that Black's cut at 'a' is a hidden trouble, so I'm trying to find an opportunity to get rid of it; Second, I didn't give too much thought, I think after the atari of W56, Black has to prevent the cut by reinforcing at 'b', then I will jump to 'c'. Only if White can jump to 'c', White should be favorable for the game, this way on the board White's points are no less than Black's. In other words, W54 and W56 are unnecessary, White should directly jump to 'c', it is regrettable that I didn't have the chance of playing this move until the end of the game.];B[hi];W[ii];B[fh]C[When Black is pondering, I realized that I'm in a big trouble! Black peeps with B57 then sticks his head out by the jump of B59, the game has instantly been turned around! ];W[jg];B[ie]
;W[hh];B[ff];W[hd];B[fj];W[kg]C[W66: White has to close his eye and cut here, otherwise White has no other good moves here.];B[de]C[The push and cut of B67 is tight!];W[ee];B[ef]LB[jd:a][kf:b][le:c]TR[lg][lf]C[The value of B69 itself is not big, but after this move, Black's tiger's move at 'a' is an absolute sente move, this way When White squeezes at 'b', Black can hang at 'a' first, then connect at 'c', White's tactic of capturing the two marked black stone to connect himself is gone.]
;W[ck];B[dm];W[cm];B[dk];W[dj]LB[cj:a]C[The hane of W74 is from the state of mind, to retreat at 'a' is the proper move, but that is already not enough to win the game.];B[jd];W[jc];B[cj]C[After Black twists and cuts with B77, White has suffered a huge loss in territory and is very painful.];W[dl];B[di];W[ek]
;B[ci];W[kq];B[kp];W[cc];B[bb];W[lq];B[bk];W[bl];B[ll];W[il];B[jp];W[km];B[jm]
;W[kl];B[jl];W[jk];B[kk];W[jn];B[im];W[mk];B[lk];W[kn];B[hl];W[pm]LB[nm:a][lm:b][ln:c][nl:d][ml:e][mm:f][mn:g][nn:h][qm:i]TR[kh][ki][kj][kk][lk][ll]C[The last thing I need to clarify is that the purpose of W104 is to prepare to kill the marked six back stones with the knight's move at 'a', if White directly makes the knight's move at 'a', then B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f', W 'g' and B 'h', Black would run away. However after W104, if Black answers at 'i', then White's knight's move at 'a' will work.]
;B[ik];W[qm]C[Afterwards, White has no way to turn the game around, although I have caught up a lot but Black's slight advantage can't be taken away in the end.
