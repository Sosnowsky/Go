;W[jp];B[cn];W[fq];B[ck];W[mq]C[As to Black's mini-Chinese, W10 approaching from outside is normal.];B[np];W[mp];B[nq]LB[qm:a]C[B11 and B13: Black aims to obtain sente, however, White is left with the invasion at 'a' and Black is a little dissatisfied.];W[no];B[po];W[mm]
;B[fc];W[cf];B[db];W[ci]C[W20 making two space extension is urgent.];B[bp];W[dn]C[As to the knight's move of B21, W22 is the correct move, this way White can make use of W16.];B[dm];W[en];B[em];W[fm];B[ek];W[bq]C[W28 is a strong move.]
;B[cq];W[bo];B[br];W[co];B[er]C[But after the hane of B29, Black makes the knight of B33, Black's loss in the corner is also very big.];W[gk]C[The cap of W34 attacking Black is White's compensation.];B[bi];W[bh];B[di];W[ch]LB[cj:a]C[As to B35 and B37, W38 is a slow move, White should bump at 'a' to obtain sente.];B[fr]LB[eq:a][ep:b][gq:c]C[But B39 is not good, Black should push at 'a' instead, White will be very difficult: If White blocks at 'b', Black can clamp at 'c'; If White retreats, White appears thin.]
;W[gq];B[nc];W[mj]LB[qm:a]C[W42 is superficially clever, White should directly invade at 'a'.];B[hd]LB[nn:a]C[B43: Black should strengthen at 'a'.];W[qm]C[The invasion of W44 is severe.];B[nm]C[The attachment of B45 is a common tactic.];W[nl];B[nn]LB[ol:a]C[The first feeling of B47 is to play counter-hane at 'a', this is definitely better than the real game.]

;B[ng];W[qf];B[qe];W[oh];B[nh];W[oi]LB[re:a][rd:b][pe:c][oe:d]C[W66: White's favorable consciousness is too strong. White should first play hane at 'a', after B 'b', then after the atari of W 'c', White can extend out at 'd', Black has no good answer.];B[rf];W[rg];B[pf]C[B67 and B69: Black takes advantage in sente.]
