Copyright by gogameworld.com and weiqi.tom.com.]RE[W+2.5];B[qd]C[The quarter final will be held in two days, today the two games are Wang Lei vs. Lee Sedol, Wang Xi vs. Song TaeKon, tomorrow two games are Gu Li vs. Cho Cheolhan, Zhou Heyang vs. Park YuongHoon.];W[dd];B[pp];W[dp];B[oc]
;W[qj];B[cj];W[nq];B[qn];W[qg]C[The opening from B1 to W10 is very steady, this opening was very popular five and six years ago, later on because of the big komi, it is rarely seen in national games, in the game Black elects this opening, perhaps because the komi is 6.5.];B[fq];W[cn];B[cg];W[gc];B[lq];W[ip]C[Black pincers with B15 and White counter-pincers with W16, here starts a fierce fight, both sides are very strong and powerful.];B[np]
;W[op];B[oq];W[oo];B[pq];W[mp];B[no]TR[op]LB[eq:a]C[Through B23, because Black can escape his ladder stones, in this local fight Black gains. In the process, the wedge of W18 (the marked white stone) is hasty, White should attack first by playing at 'a', in the game it seems White miscalculates the ladder.];W[mq];B[nn];W[lp]
(;B[dr]LB[dq:a][cq:b][cr:c][cp:d][er:e][eq:f][ep:g][fr:h][do:i][bp:j][gq:k][cc:l]C[B27: If I were Black, I would play B 'a', W 'b' and B 'c', if White simply connects at 'd', Black can hang at 'e' to achieve safety; If White elects to atari at 'f', next B27, W 'e', B 'g', W 'h', B 'd', W 'i', B 'j' and W 'k', Black can grab the big 3-3 point at 'l' (see var a).];W[cq]
;B[ir];W[jr];B[cr]LB[jq:a][hq:b]C[B31 is a slow move, in the game, since he doesn't know to answer on the right side, so Black simply enters the corner, but this move is definitely small, on the right side even if Black dare not hane out at 'a', Black at least should make the diagonal at 'b', they are all bigger than entering the corner.];W[hr];B[bq];W[bp];B[br]C[After the pincer of W32, Black still has to seek life in gote with B33 and B35, in this area Black's play is a little inexplicable.];W[ce]C[After White grabs the eye-catching big point with W36, the situation starts to slightly favor White.];B[cl];W[fr]C[The sequence following W38 seeks the tempo for playing.]
;B[ep];W[eo];B[dq];W[cp];B[fo];W[en];B[hq];W[iq];B[gr];W[is]C[Through W48, it comes to an end.];B[ic]C[Black must force with B49.];W[qm]
;B[pm];W[ql]C[White happily takes advantage in sente with W50 and W52.];B[rn];W[mc]C[The invasion of W54 is also inevitable.];B[ie];W[me];B[ec];W[dc];B[fc];W[hc]C[W60 is a good move.];B[ib];W[fd]
;B[gb];W[ed];B[hb]C[Through B65, Black obtains very little profit.];W[oe];B[re];W[rf];B[mb]C[Black seems to have no choice but to play the sequence following B69, although it is damaging to territory, but in order to stick the head out, Black doesn't have any other good tactic.];W[nb];B[nc];W[pc];B[pd];W[ob]
;B[pb];W[od];B[qc];W[nd];B[pc];W[lb];B[pf];W[om];B[pl]LB[on:a]C[When W82, the push of B83 is the only move, Black can't consider to tolerate by playing at 'a'.];W[on];B[qk];W[rk]
;B[pk];W[pj];B[nk];W[nm];B[rl]C[Through B91, it forms an exchange, Black is a little damaging in territory but still keeps the lead in the game.];W[se]C[W92 is a clever move locally.];B[qf];W[rd];B[pg];W[qe];B[pe];W[qh]
;B[ng];W[mg];B[oj];W[re]C[Through W102, after White settles down, I think White is a little favorable.];B[mf];W[lf];B[nf];W[kc]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.];B[db];W[cb];B[eb]C[B107 and B109 are huge moves.];W[he]
;B[if];W[bg]C[When White attaches with W112, ...];B[bf]LB[bh:a]C[..., the counterattack of B113 is inevitable, if Black retreats now at 'a', then Black wouldn't have any fighting chance on the board.];W[bh]C[After W114, a fierce fight starts again.];B[cf];W[di];B[eg];W[ci];B[ek];W[fi];B[gg]
