Translation:GoGameWorld.];B[pd]C[Recently we have commented on Lee Sedol's games quite often. There are two reasons, first, no matter whether he loses or wins, Lee Sedol's games are never tasteless; Second, Lee Sedol has lost quite a few games recently, this is also a piece of news that is worth mentioning. Now let's see the playoff game in which he got eliminated from the Paewang contest by Yoon SeongHyun 8p.];W[dp];B[qp];W[dc];B[oq]C[Black's opening is imposing, the sequence of B1, B3 and B5 becomes popular again nowadays, I used to play this opening quite often in about 1995.]
;W[qj];B[cf];W[cd];B[dj]LB[ci:a][ck:b]C[B9: If Black makes the two-space extension at 'a', then White would check at 'b', Black wouldn't feel comfortable.];W[cl];B[ef];W[dg];B[df];W[gc]LB[gd:a]C[W14: However, since White first peeps with W12, it is necessary for White to make the large knight's move at 'a'.]
;B[ql]C[The sequence after B15 is popular.];W[qf];B[qh];W[of];B[rd]LB[nc:a]TR[gc]C[B19: Black varies by jumping to the second line, the usual play is B 'a' and W 19. Considering the position of the marked white stone is low, Black do have an inclination to play like this.];W[nd];B[nc];W[mc];B[oc];W[mb]
;B[pi];W[mg];B[pj];W[gf]TR[gc]SQ[dg]LB[ci:a]C[W24, W26 and W28 seems inevitable, actually they are questionable! Since there is no big potential on the upper side, then White must have suffered some losses with the exchange of W24, W26 for B25, B27. Same reason for W28, due to the low position of the triangled white stone, White's configuration at the top is no good. The purpose of playing the square marked peep stone is to strike at 'a'.];B[ci]LB[md:a]C[Through 29, White's opening has failed! Let's study this five moves from W24 to W28. I think, so far both sides have played to achieve their own purposes, then sometimes it would be necessary to ruin your opponent's plan. Now Black decides to give White the top side to trade for the right side. In theory, White should try to obtain the right side. Moreover, W24 would be better played at 29 for White to pull out and take sente, then White can turn to make the diagonal's extension at 25, leaving Black the hane move at 24 and the cut at 'a'. If you feel that it is White's wishful thinking, at least W24 should be played as the diagonal's extension at 25.];W[fq];B[jp];W[mj]
;B[ed];W[ec];B[if]C[In the real game, Black becomes thick across the board, Black then dares to invade, it makes White very painful and White's defects are also exposed.
];W[he]LB[gd:a]C[W36: Because White has to prevent Black from attaching out at 'a', White has no other alternative.];B[le];W[od];B[pc];W[ld];B[lg];W[lh];B[kh]C[It is not clearly seen who has benefited from the exchange of B37 for W38 and W40. Black's main purpose is to seek the tune to play B41 and B43. In fact, Black should simply stick his head out by playing at 43 which also indirectly pounds on the weakness of White's two-space jump, this would be very adequate.
]
;W[kg]C[The cut and atari of W44 is a counter-attack driven beyond the limits of forbearance.];B[lf];W[jh];B[ki];W[jg];B[li]TR[jh]LB[mh:a]C[B49: Since the marked white stone has already made Black heavy, so Black is reluctant to cut and atari at 'a'. In the game Black elects to fight by sacrificing and building his moyo on the lower side, which is out of playing momentum.];W[mh];B[mi];W[ni];B[nj]
;W[ji];B[mk];W[nh]LB[ng:a]C[W56 is a fatal mistake! It is hard to imagine that Lee Sedol, who is so sharp in the shape, could make such a mistake. White should play at 'a'.];B[kk];W[pq];B[pr];W[qm];B[rl];W[qq];B[pp];W[qr];B[or]
;W[rp]C[After this move, it is time for lunch break.];B[ro];W[sq];B[qo];W[rr]C[The sequence from W60 to W70 is also unwise. Although White manages to live a small corner, but Black becomes thick outside.];B[gg];W[hg];B[fg];W[hh];B[cn]C[After gaining advantage in sente with B71 and B73, Black then invades with B75, Black has established his superiority.];W[bp];B[en]
;W[hq];B[co];W[cp];B[iq];W[hp];B[jn];W[jl]C[W84: While under an unfavorable situation, White starts to play the game-deciding moves. Causing confusion in the game is what Lee Sedol does best, unfortunately Black has played flawlessly.];B[nf]TR[nh]SQ[qf]C[The attachment of B85 is the hidden trouble left over by the triangled white stone, this gives Black the big play to push and capture the square marked white stone. White's situation has deteriorated.];W[og];B[oe]
;W[ne];B[pe];W[mf];B[gd];W[hd];B[fc];W[fb];B[fm]TR[cl]C[The diagonal's extension of B95 is the right move! it not only has locked in the marked white stone, but also contained White's invasion into the center.];W[fk];B[gk];W[gj];B[gl]
;W[oj];B[nk];W[ll];B[lk];W[jo]TR[fk]C[White has no choice but to release again the dazzling game-deciding moves such as the marked white stone and W104.];B[io]C[B105: Black is not willing to give way.];W[ko];B[ip];W[in];B[kn];W[kp]
;B[im];W[hn];B[ir]C[Through 113, White has finally failed in his game-deciding moves.];W[gn];B[kq];W[dk];B[fj]LB[hj:a]C[B117 at 'a' would be much better.];W[cj];B[di];W[fl];B[gm]
;W[bm];B[hj];W[jk];B[gi]C[Through 125, although White has handled the left side in sente, but White already has paid the price earlier with the sequence after W104, White is hard to redeem his defeat.];W[kl];B[mn]LB[mm:a][ok:b][ol:c][pk:d]C[B127 is a mistake due to the time pressure in the overtime. Black should make the knight's move at 'a', then W 'b', B 'c', White couldn't push at 'd'. thus Black would win easily.];W[qg];B[so];W[sp]
;B[bo];W[bk];B[bj];W[ao];B[an];W[ap];B[fd];W[gb];B[nb]C[The hane of B139 is a huge move and it also helps to reduce ko threats, the game is still favorable for Black.];W[ln]LB[bn:a][oi:b][lo:c]C[The wedge of W140 is a tesuji! the situation becomes chaotic for a while. Furthermore, if White instead reinforce at 'a' to protect the cut, then B 'b', W 140, B 'c', Black would still win the game.]
;B[lm];W[ml];B[bn]C[B143: Black initiates the ko decisively.];W[bi];B[ck];W[mm];B[lo];W[cj];B[me];W[md];B[ck];W[ok];B[nl]
;W[cj];B[jj];W[ij];B[ck];W[pk]LB[nm:a][kj:b]C[W158: If White turns at 'a' then Black would get two more ko threats at 'b', if Black answers flawlessly, it would still be Black's victory.];B[nm];W[cj];B[rh];W[oi];B[ck];W[nn]
