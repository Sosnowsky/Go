;W[fc];B[cn];W[fq]C[Due to big komi (7.5), as to B5 and B7, White responds freely with W6 and W8, not tangling with Black and allowing Black to form a good shape.];B[dj];W[po];B[pm]C[As to W10, the tight pincer of B11 is to initiate fight, but White responds steadily and Black comes to nothing.];W[no];B[nq];W[qq];B[qr];W[qp];B[or]
;W[qm];B[ql];W[pl];B[rm];W[qn];B[qk];W[ol];B[pk];W[nl];B[pf]LB[ph:a][qf:b]C[B27 is an early questionable move. W24 and W26 are very solid. Later on if White invades at 'a', Black has no answer. Thus with B27 Black can only reinforce at 'b'.];W[kc]
;B[bd];W[cc];B[ef]C[B29 and B31 are hasty moves. Now for Black to invade the right side is more urgent.];W[cl]C[When White invades with W32, at any rate Black shouldn't allow White to play thickness like in the game.];B[cp]LB[dl:a]C[B33: Perhaps Black can only press at 'a' and allow White to live on the side.];W[cq];B[bq];W[co];B[bp];W[do];B[dq]
;W[cr];B[dr];W[br];B[ar];W[bo];B[cs];W[ch]LB[ci:a]C[W46: White can consider to invade at 'a'.];B[dh];W[ci];B[di];W[cg];B[dg]
;W[bf];B[ce];W[cj];B[ic]LB[hc:a]C[B55: For Black to invade at 'a' is better.];W[hd]C[W56 is a brilliant move, taking the whole game into account.];B[id];W[ie];B[hc];W[gd];B[kd];W[je]
;B[lc];W[gg]C[White sacrifices one stone W28 but is able to grab the vital point with W64. White already doesn't concern the safety in the corner and is more free to play on the right side.];B[dl]LB[gi:a]C[The play of B65 is inexplicable! Black certainly should play at 'a'.];W[de];B[df];W[gj]C[W68: White again takes the vital point.];B[gl];W[ck]C[W70 is an asking move. Black's big dragon becomes a target, White already takes control of the game.];B[dk];W[ld]
;B[ke]LB[kb:a]C[B73: As to the cut of W72, Black is difficult. However Black can only tolerate at 'a'.];W[lb]LB[pc:a]C[W74: If White attaches at 'a' instead, Black will be more difficult.];B[mc];W[jd];B[kb];W[jc];B[jb];W[kf];B[le]LB[ph:a][oi:b]C[B81: Black escapes two stones, it is very bad choice! For Black to reinforce the right side at 'a' or 'b' is imperative.]
;W[lf];B[me];W[mf];B[ne];W[ph]C[The invasion of W86 is severe. White is too thick, Black's big dragon on the left side will come under attack.];B[pi]LB[oi:a]C[B87: However, Black can also fly out at 'a' and fight desperately.];W[oi];B[qi];W[pc]LB[nh:a][qh:b][gk:c][hl:d]C[White's sequence following W90 is unnecessary. White should directly hang at 'a', Black can only turn at 'b'. Next W 'c' or 'd', this way White can win the game easily.]
;B[qc];W[qd];B[qe];W[nh];B[fo]LB[gk:a]C[B95 is clearly not a place to play. Black can only bump at 'a' even this is painful.];W[qg];B[rf];W[dm]C[After W98, Black already has no place to play.];B[em];W[en];B[dn]
;W[cm];B[gh]LB[fn:a]C[B103: Black can't block at 'a'.];W[fm];B[hg];W[fh];B[el];W[fn];B[fg];W[gf];B[hh];W[fi];B[hj]
;W[hi]C[When W114, Black already suffers a big defeat.];B[ii];W[gi];B[ij];W[gk];B[hk];W[ih];B[fl];W[hm]LB[hl:a]C[W122: If White cuts at 'a', the game can be over.];B[hl];W[jh]
;B[im];W[in];B[gm];W[gn];B[hn];W[ho]C[Black has dodged one fatal attack, but White takes control of the situation all the time.];B[go];W[hm];B[hf];W[ff];B[hn];W[bn];B[hp]

;W[kp];B[lp];W[ko];B[jq];W[mp];B[gp];W[is];B[lr];W[mq];B[mr];W[gb];B[ia]C[B175: Black just wants to take small advantage in endgame and instead is being captured by White.];W[hb]
