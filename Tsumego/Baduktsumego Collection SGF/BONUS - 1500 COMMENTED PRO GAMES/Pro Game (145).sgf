;B[dp];W[dq];B[co];W[fq];B[bp];W[cq];B[ci]C[The new opening from B1 to B13 is very popular recently, Chinese players have also done a lot of research on it.];W[cn]C[The clamp of W14 is very rare.];B[bn];W[do];B[bo];W[dn]
;B[cm];W[dm];B[cl]C[I think, when originally playing the clamp of W14, Gu Li perhaps thought Black will connect at 16 to fight with White, unexpectedly Lee Sedol also shows his soft side, through B21, I think White is a little damaging.
];W[kc]LB[dl:a]C[W22: White can also press at 'a', White's shape is better this way.];B[nc];W[hc];B[fc];W[he];B[qj];W[kp];B[dl]
;W[fm];B[fn]C[In the game, Black turns with B29 and attaches at White's key stones with B31, White is a little painful.];W[em];B[gm];W[gl];B[hm];W[hl];B[il];W[fk];B[im];W[fo]C[Through W40, Black is favorable.]
(;B[ip]LB[lm:a][ho:b][pm:c][qn:d][gp:e][go:f][hp:g][jp:h]C[But the following B41 is a bad move, Black should play at 'a', taking the whole game into account, if White jumps to 'b', Black can play at 'c', this way White is clearly no good, so White most likely will not jump to 'b' to enclose territory, White may protect the corner at 'd', this way it is still not too late for Black to play as in the real game. Moreover, even if Black wants to play B41 here, the play in the game also seems a little insipid, Black should simply strike at 'e', followed by W 'f', B 'b', W 'g' and B 'h', this way black stones' efficiency is high and adequate (see var a).];W[lm]C[After White takes the vital point with W42, White turns the game around.];B[gp];W[fp];B[lk]LB[ij:a][kk:b]C[B45 is Lee Sedol's style, he is definitely reluctant to simply escape at 'a', but after the cap of B45, the tactic of attaching at 'b' is clearly effective, still can't see how Lee Sedol to solve this problem.

;W[kn]LB[kk:a]C[W46 is over-steady, by Gu Li's style, the move is really surprising, I originally think White will definitely attach out at 'a'.];B[ij];W[li]C[After Black strengthens with the jump of B47, the attack of W48 now is already one step slow.];B[nk]C[B49 is strong and unyielding.];W[kk]C[With White's sequence following W50, although White separates Black, but White doesn't achieve any practical result.];B[kl];W[ll];B[kj];W[jk];B[jj]
;W[mk];B[lj];W[mj];B[qn];W[qp];B[nm]C[Through B61, White amounts to nothing.
];W[ml]C[W62: White has no choice but to strengthen, if Black cuts here, Black's big dragon on the left side will also be safe right away.];B[jg]LB[mq:a]C[Teacher Liu Xiaoguang 9p's opinion is, with B63, Black can consider to invade at 'a', this would also be very severe.

In the game, Black strengthens the center, perhaps Lee Sedol feels his situation is already not bad.];W[pk]LB[ql:a][pm:b][qm:c][mq:d]C[The shallow reduction of W64 is a little "soft", White should directly invade at 'a', next B 'b', White can play the good squeezing move at 'c', this way White can fight, therefore with B63 Black still should invade at 'd'.]
;B[pj];W[nl]LB[qk:a]C[W66: If White attaches down at 'a', there will be some complicated variations, in the real game, Gu Li's play in this area is not that tough, perhaps he wants to put the main battle field on the left side.];B[ql];W[ch]C[The attachment of W68 is a good move to create troubles in this situation.];B[id];W[hd];B[dh];W[cd];B[cc];W[bi]LB[dg:a][di:b][bc:c][bb:d][be:e]C[But W74 is an overplay, this play is below the standard, White can only hane at 'a', this way the situation would be still complicated, when W 'a', if Black connects at 'b', then W 'c', B 'd' and W 'e', this way White's shape is very resilient.]
;B[cg];W[bh];B[df]C[B75 and B77 are simple and good move.];W[cj];B[di];W[dj];B[bk];W[bj];B[jb]C[B83 is severe, White is clearly in a bitter battle.];W[jf];B[kg]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.];W[kf]
;B[lf];W[le];B[me];W[ld];B[mf]C[Through B91, Black's advantage is clear.];W[qc];B[rd];W[oc];B[md];W[kb]C[White first exchanges in sente with W92 and W94, then comes back to strengthen with W96, it is good sequence.];B[if];W[ie]
;B[lc]LB[pd:a]C[B99: If Black simply strengthens at 'a', White is still not good, White's territory is inadequate.];W[kd];B[lb]C[The play of B101 is very strong and unyielding.];W[nb]LB[pd:a][ic:b]C[W102: If White hangs at 'a', Black can attach out at 'b', White is no good.];B[ka];W[ic];B[pd]C[B105: Black's calculation is very accurate.];W[pc]
;B[ob]C[B107 is a good move, it seems White already has no chance.];W[ph]C[W108: White has no other choice but to open up a new battle field.];B[pf]C[B109 is steady, calling off a battle when the situation is to your favor.];W[of];B[oe];W[oi];B[oj];W[nj];B[pi];W[pg]LB[oh:a][qh:b]C[W116 is a desperate move, if White simply connects at 'a', Black will hane over at 'b', the game would be over immediately. Afterwards, although White continues to fight, but I'm afraid White is already fraught with grim possibilities.]

;W[dd];B[bf]C[Lee Sedol's calculation skill is very strong, and he played very brilliantly today; In contrast, Gu Li didn't completely free himself and his play is not resolute enough.

Lee Sedol advanced to the final, the best-of-3 final will take place on 12/7, 12/9 and 12/10 respectively.])
