;W[od];B[ld];W[pg]LB[of:a][qg:b][id:c]C[W8: White can also elect to jump to 'a', next B 'b' and W 'c', the situation will be a chaotic fight.];B[oe];W[ne];B[of];W[qc];B[qf];W[pd];B[qe]
;W[le]C[W16: White presses out, which is a very old joseki.];B[ke];W[lf];B[lc];W[rc];B[ob];W[nd];B[pb];W[nb];B[mb]LB[pc:a]C[The exchange of W24 and B25 should be reserved, for Black to simply connect at 'a' is a little better.];W[pc]
;B[pi]C[Through B27, I think Black is favorable.];W[lh];B[db];W[qk];B[qj];W[pk];B[ni];W[qn];B[pn];W[pm];B[qo];W[on];B[po]C[Black's play from B31 to B39 is very practical and substantial.]
;W[nh];B[oi]C[B41 connecting simply is good move.];W[mi];B[og];W[hd];B[fe];W[hf]LB[nc:a]TR[nb][mb]SQ[ke][hd]C[W46 is a little slow, at any rate White should connect at 'a'. This way the exchange of W24 and B25 (the triangle-marked stones) is not damaging, and also for Black to capture the square-marked white stone is not easy, and White can run out together with the square-marked black stone.];B[nc]
;W[fg]C[White's play in the game is too superficial, can't see any territory.];B[cc];W[dp];B[fq];W[cn];B[ip];W[nm];B[qm];W[rn];B[rm];W[rj];B[ri];W[nj]C[White ends in gote again from W54 to W60, which is the losing cause of this game.]
;B[mg]C[The jump of B61 is good move!];W[ng];B[nf];W[mf];B[kg];W[lg];B[oh];W[mh];B[md];W[me];B[dr]C[After taking advantage in sente, Black again gets to fly with B71.];W[dj]C[White's territory is clearly inadequate, Black has no weak groups on the board.]
;B[fo];W[kq];B[mq];W[ko];B[jq];W[jr];B[ir];W[cd];B[cl]C[W80 and B81 are miai points, Black must get one.];W[en]C[As to White, if can't capture B81, White's territory is not enough, but it is obviously very difficult to capture B81.];B[cj]C[Black's dodging sequence following B83 is very beautiful.];W[ci]
