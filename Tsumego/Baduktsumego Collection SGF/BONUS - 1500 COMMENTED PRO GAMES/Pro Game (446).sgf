Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[In this game 12 of Jeongganjang Cup Women Go Contest, Xu Ying 5p of China who has achieved two consecutive victories takes Black and plays with Park JiEun 5p of Korea.];W[dd];B[pq];W[oc];B[dp]
;W[po];B[kd];W[qq];B[pc]C[B7 and B9: Black starts to strike first, Black's tempo is not bad.];W[od];B[pf];W[le];B[ke];W[lf];B[ld];W[ne];B[ph];W[kf]
;B[gc];W[if]LB[qj:a][cf:b]C[W20 is questionable, White should first force at 'a', it is a huge point, if B 'b', then White can jump to the right side and start to fight.];B[hd];W[cf]C[In the game, White ends in gote with W22.];B[ql]LB[qk:a]C[Black gets to first make the extension with W23, it is very big, however Black should make the large knight's move at 'a', which is relatively steadier.];W[pp];B[oq];W[rp];B[lq]
;W[jq]LB[pi:a]C[W28: White can consider to attach in at 'a' to probe Black.];B[lo];W[gq];B[eq];W[mp];B[lp];W[jo];B[ip];W[jp];B[gp]C[The play of B35 and B37 is fierce, but the gain and loss is not clear.];W[hq]
;B[hp];W[km];B[mm];W[kr];B[lr];W[lk]LB[hn:a][fq:b]C[W44 seems a little fancy, White can consider to make the knight's move at 'a', if Black strengthens at 'b', White still can strike on the second line.];B[hm]C[B45 is good feeling, preventing White's tactic of playing hane and getting out to initiate a fight.];W[pi];B[oi];W[pj]
;B[oh]LB[qh:a]C[B47 and B49 are positive, for Black to descend at 'a' is steady.];W[ok];B[kl];W[ll];B[lm];W[kn]LB[jm:a]TR[ql]C[W54 is slow, White can consider to extend at 'a', the marked black stone is relatively hard to move.];B[no];W[jl];B[pm]
;W[nl];B[on]C[B55, B57 and B59 are practical, Black obtains territory.];W[cn]LB[cq:a]C[W60: White should directly enter the corner at 'a', White would be easier to control.];B[cl]C[Black's sequence following B61 is tight.];W[dl];B[dk];W[dm];B[cj];W[bp];B[en];W[fl]
;B[fj];W[hl];B[bo];W[co];B[bq]C[B71 and B73 are good moves for settling the shape.];W[cp];B[cq];W[ec];B[nj];W[nk];B[md];W[of];B[ng]
;W[nf];B[ki];W[jj];B[ji];W[hj];B[hi]C[Black's sequence from B77 to B87 is intense.];W[gf];B[gj];W[ij];B[gh];W[ii];B[ih];W[hg]
;B[hh];W[je];B[jd];W[ob];B[pr];W[qr];B[qn];W[ro];B[fb];W[eb];B[qb];W[lb];B[kb]
;W[nm]C[W108 is a mistake, White should make one-space extension on the left side.];B[qo];W[qp];B[rn]C[Black exploits White happily in sente with the sequence from B109 to B111.];W[rr];B[gm];W[gl];B[bf]C[B115 is a brilliant move.];W[bg];B[cg];W[be];B[df]
;W[ce];B[bh];W[af]C[Through W122, Black takes advantage in sente.];B[jg];W[jf];B[ea];W[da];B[fa];W[cb];B[he];W[ig];B[fe]LB[mb:a][rb:b]C[B131: Black starts to have killing intentions, but the simple-jump cut is also risking, Black should clamp at 'a' to take one stone, White connects back at 131, Black strengthens the cut at 'b', this way, Black is leading about 10+ points on the board, Black will win the game by a large margin.]
;W[pe];B[qe];W[pg];B[me];W[mf];B[qf];W[mb];B[kj];W[nn]C[The exchange of B139 and W140 is damaging.];B[jb]C[With the play of B141, Black probably already see clearly how to kill and destroy eyes.];W[og];B[mh]LB[qh:a][kh:b][jh:c][mj:d]C[B143 is a very regrettable losing move, Black suddenly loses her mind. Black should descend at 'a', next W143, Black connects, W 'b', B 'c' and W 'd', Black clearly is left with the tactic of playing the ko, this is also to Black's advantage.]
;W[qg]C[With the sequence following W144, White breaks through Black's defense line.];B[qh];W[rf];B[rh];W[rg];B[re];W[rc]C[Next White makes eye with the sequence following W150, Black's loss is heavy, Black's defeat is already set.];B[rb];W[pd];B[sc];W[nd];B[oo]
