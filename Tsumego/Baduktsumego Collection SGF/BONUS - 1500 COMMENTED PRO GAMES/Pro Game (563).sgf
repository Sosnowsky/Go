Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[pd]C[An Choyoung's momentum is very strong after winning three consecutive games, especially he overturned the last game against Luo Xihe, he was also very lucky.];W[dp]C[Chang Hao takes Black. In the first phase, White won all games, but Black won last game, perhaps it means Black will all win.];B[pq];W[dc];B[cn]
;W[cl];B[cf];W[ch];B[cc];W[cd];B[dd];W[bc];B[cb];W[de];B[ed];W[ce];B[bb];W[fe]
;B[ee];W[ef];B[ec];W[df];B[cq];W[cp];B[dq];W[ep];B[bp];W[bo];B[bq];W[co];B[fq]C[Through B31, the opening is acceptable for both sides.]
;W[po];B[qo];W[qn];B[qp];W[qf]C[The sequence from W32 to W36 is normal.];B[pi]LB[pj:a]C[Due to the configuration on the left side, the counterattack of B37 is inevitable, but whether Black can play at 'a' instead is worth study.];W[nc];B[pf];W[pg];B[of];W[qe]
;B[qd];W[og];B[nd];W[md];B[ng];W[od];B[pe];W[qh];B[qi];W[oh];B[ne];W[ld]C[After W54, Black is difficult with his next move.];B[oj]
;W[nh];B[mg];W[mh];B[lg];W[lh];B[kg]C[Black's tempo from B55 to B61 is a little slow.];W[kh]LB[mk:a]C[W62: White can consider to play at around 'a'.];B[pn]C[However, Black also doesn't have good moves to play, since after the cut of B63, White has many ways to play.];W[jg];B[jf];W[jd]
;B[oc]LB[ob:a]C[B67 taking one stone is too inconvenient, it seems Black should make the knight's move at 'a'.];W[ob];B[pc];W[pl];B[on];W[nl]C[W70 and W72 are one way and it is very severe.];B[mj];W[lk]LB[ql:a]C[W74: White caps strongly, Black has no state of mind to attach over at 'a'.];B[lj]
;W[kj];B[ml]C[In the real game, the counterattack of B77 is inevitable.];W[nk];B[mk];W[nj]C[White can capture three stones (B37, B51 and B55) on the side and should have nothing to complain.];B[nm];W[mm];B[ll]LB[lm:a][mn:b][ol:c]C[B83: Black may want to first atari at 'a', after W 'b', then Black can wedge at 'c'. In the real game, Black can't capture W82 with one move and is very painful.];W[nn]
;B[om];W[qm];B[ol];W[ok];B[pk];W[ni];B[lm];W[qk];B[rg]C[Following B93, Black exerts power.];W[qg];B[rk];W[pj]C[After W96, White is left with making life in gote and Black obtains a big profit!]
;B[fp]LB[jp:a]C[B97: For Black to make extension at 'a' is common thinking.];W[mn]LB[kq:a]C[W98: If White splits at 'a', Black is not easy to attack White.];B[oo];W[jp];B[lp];W[lq];B[mq];W[lo];B[mp];W[in]C[After W104, with W106 White dare not pull out, it is a little weird.]
;B[ko];W[kn];B[jo];W[ln];B[jn];W[km];B[jm];W[kl]C[From W108 to W114, it forms an exchange, Black is favorable for the whole game.];B[jl]LB[fn:a][im:b][kk:c][nb:d][rl:e]C[But B115 and B117 are overplay, the crude move of B115 should be reserved, Black should jump to 'a' instead, pressing White in sente, then Black can simply turn at 'b', followed by W 'c' and B 'd', on the right side Black is left with the tactic of making life at 'e', this way Black will win the game happily.]
;W[kk];B[bn];W[dn];B[dm];W[fo];B[en];W[eo];B[fm]C[The sequence from B117 to B123 is not like Chang Hao's style, perhaps due to time pressure his judgement is not optimistic, and perhaps Chang Hao wants to change style on purpose. Overall, with this kind of play Black takes a very big risk!];W[an];B[am];W[ao];B[cm];W[bl]
;B[bm];W[gm];B[gl];W[hm];B[hl];W[fl];B[fk];W[el];B[dl];W[ek];B[dk];W[ej];B[em]LB[gp:a][dj:b]C[After B141, White has several choices, Black is all dangerous, for example, White can first play hane at 'a', then attach at 'b'.]
;W[io];B[dj];W[go]LB[ei:a]C[Or with W144 White retreats at 'a' calmly.];B[ei];W[fj];B[gi];W[gj];B[hj];W[hk];B[fi];W[gk];B[il]
;W[ij];B[jq]C[Through B155, White is already very dangerous.];W[fr]LB[hr:a]C[However W156 is the last losing move, if White simply makes knight's move at 'a', White is not easy to die unconditionally.];B[gr];W[ci];B[di];W[hr];B[gq];W[eq]LB[jr:a]C[W162: If White simply clamps at 'a' instead, White perhaps still have chances.]
;B[er];W[ip];B[kp];W[jr];B[hq];W[iq];B[kq]C[In the real game, White dies too cleanly!];W[hi];B[gg];W[kr];B[lr];W[hf];B[cj]
;W[bj];B[bk];W[bi];B[gh]LB[gf:a]C[B179: Black should directly push at 'a'.];W[ak]LB[gf:a]C[W180: If White plays at 'a' instead, White perhaps still can reduce liberties, but it has nothing to do with the outcome of this game.];B[gf];W[ge];B[ig])
