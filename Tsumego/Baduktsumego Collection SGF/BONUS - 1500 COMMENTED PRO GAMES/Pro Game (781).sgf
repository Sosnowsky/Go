Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[In 2006 National Level A Team Tournament, I meet Luo Xihe 9p. As a result, I turned the game around in an almost desperate situation and won luckily.];W[dc];B[pp];W[dp];B[ce]
;W[ci];B[cn];W[cl];B[gc];W[ed];B[jd];W[cd];B[pj];W[oc];B[mc];W[ge]C[I once played W16 against Lee Sedol, in this game Luo Xihe's W16 is a variation.];B[pc];W[oe]C[The thinking of W16 and W18 is not coherent.]
;B[pf];W[pb];B[qb];W[le];B[kc]LB[ld:a]C[B23: Black can also consider to bump at 'a'.];W[jf]C[The sequence following W24 is all pre-planned.];B[kf];W[of];B[pg];W[ke];B[je]

;W[ig];B[he];W[ih];B[ji];W[gh]C[White's shape is vivid, Black incurs a big loss.];B[li];W[ph]LB[nh:a]C[W48: White should strengthen at 'a'.];B[nh]C[However, Black's play also is problematic.];W[qg];B[ng]C[B51: Black captures three stones, but ...]
;W[pd];B[qc];W[qe]C[... through W54, Black is being pierced through by White, originally White comes under attack, now White lives very comfortably, Black again incurs a big loss.];B[nd];W[od];B[ob];W[qj];B[qk];W[qi];B[fg];W[fh];B[de];W[ee]
;B[ef];W[gd];B[hd];W[fc];B[gf]C[The sequence from B61 to B69 is about acceptable, but Black's situation is already not good.];W[cq];B[en];W[dm];B[dn];W[gp];B[em];W[el];B[fl]
;W[fk];B[gm]LB[gl:a]C[B79 is also a mistake, Black can only extend at 'a'. In the game, Black's shape is not good, Black's losing trend is already very obvious.];W[gl];B[fm];W[gk];B[cj];W[dj];B[iq]C[B85 forcing from this side is already very far-fetched.];W[ip];B[hq];W[hp]

;B[hl];W[lq];B[bk];W[bl];B[dk]C[After B129, White's shape appears defective, the situation becomes complicated.];W[ak];B[di];W[ek];B[ej];W[ch];B[dh];W[dl];B[dj]

;B[ir];W[js]LB[jm:a][hm:b][kk:c][kj:d][lk:e]C[W164 striking to kill Black's big group is too relentless. if White attaches at 'a', next B 'b', W 'c', B 'd' and W 'e', White wins the game for sure.];B[hs];W[hr];B[cg];W[bg];B[gr];W[fs]
;B[eq];W[fq];B[jm]C[Luo Xihe overlooks the push of B173, White's shape appears have a loop hole.];W[km];B[jn];W[jo];B[kl];W[ll];B[kk];W[np]C[The atari of W180 is a big crude move! White reduces one of his own liberties, making the later throw-in ko tactic working. Since White has no ko threats, after this ko, White loses big.];B[qs];W[io]
