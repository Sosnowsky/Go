(;SZ[19]EV[6th Samsung semi final game 2]DT[2001-11-07]PC[Korea]KM[6.5]PW[Lee Changho]BR[9p]PB[Chang Hao]WR[9p]RE[W+R]C[Copyright by gogameworld.com and weiqi.tom.com.];B[pd]C[In the game 1 held on 6th, Chang Hao 9p won the game luckily over Lee Changho by half point.

Chang Hao 9p of China is Black.];W[dp]C[Game 1 had several twists and turns, in the middle game, Chang Hao's White was quite good, but after the exchange in the center, Lee Changho narrowed down the difference. In the endgame phase, Korean players in the study room were all optimistic, they even couldn't count normally, in a very close situation, they thought Lee Changho was leading 8 to 9 points and Lee Changho became more valiant with the fight... Just in this time, Chang Hao won the game by half point, the whole study room was suddenly silent.

Lee Changho 9p of Korea is White.];B[pq]C[The optimism from Korean players is quite reasonable, according to past experiences, in that situation, Lee Changho is always the one who can laugh to the end. Half point, this small margin which can't be represented in the 19x19 board, once has disappointed so many top-rate professionals, and even they start to think they has been already deserted by God of victory ...];W[dd]C[So from this point of view, this half point victory for Chang Hao can be considered priceless: this time the "Stone Buddha" has also tasted half-point defeat, Lee "Stone Buddha" is a human not a God.]
;B[fq]C[As a proud student of Nie Weiping 9p, same as Teacher Nie, Chang Hao 9p is also a typical style of strength and power. Many Chinese Go fans hope that what he needs is victory, especially defeating the opponents like Lee Changho, this is a good chance.];W[cn];B[jp]LB[qk:a]C[So far, the "Kobayashi Style" opening is very common, both sides are quite familiar with this. With B7, for Black to play at 'a' to form the "Chinese Fuseki" is also seen often nowadays.];W[qn]LB[qo:a][po:b]C[W8: If White plays the low approach at 'a' or the high approach at 'b', White will all incur Black's pincer attack and the situation would become tense, so W8 is a common response to counter the "Kobayashi Style" opening.];B[po]LB[qp:a][pj:b][qh:c][on:d][mp:e]C[B9: If Black makes the diagonal's extension at 'a', then W 'b', B 'c', W 'd' and W 'e', this opening is also often seen.]
;W[rp];B[ql];W[pn];B[qo];W[ro];B[qq];W[rm]LB[nn:a][rn:b][pl:c][mp:d]C[W16 is a steady play, if White jumps to 'a', then Black can peep at 16, W 'b', B 'c' or B 'd', the following variation is relatively complicated.];B[on];W[pl]
;B[om];W[pk]C[Through 20, it is a set pattern, what White is proud of is that this White group becomes very thick, the way of strengthening with W20 is worth remembering for our Go fans, Black's configuration at the bottom is ideal and Black also should have nothing to complain.];B[fo]C[B21 is a good point of expanding moyo.];W[dr]LB[fr:a][er:b][cr:c][cq:d]C[W22 is a steady play and it is Lee Changho first-rate thinking, next the attachment at 'a' is again a very big move. Now the easiest mistake that general Go players make is, after the jump of W22, immediately making the impulsive diagonal's extension at 'b', thinking that this not only defends Black's territory at the bottom and later on Black is still left with the tactic of clamping at 'c', what you don't realize is that after the exchange of the diagonal and W22, White already takes advantage in sente, Black has lost the chance of entering the corner at 'd'.];B[fc]C[B23 is a big point.];W[hc];B[fe]LB[cc:a][dc:b][cf:c][df:d]TR[cn]C[The jump of B25 is kind of tic-for-tac play, if Black simply enters the corner at 'a', after White blocks at 'b', Black lives in the corner, because the marked white stone is in a low position, White is very solid, it seems no good. In the past, some players had tried the counter-pincer at 'c' and 'd'.]
;W[cf];B[jc]LB[id:a]TR[pk][pl]C[B27 is a good move which is not a stickler to usual plays, if Black makes the diagonal's extension at 'a' as the joseki, due to the addition of the two marked white stones, Black's outside thickness can't be fully utilized.];W[no];B[oo];W[db]LB[fb:a]C[W30: White first defends his corner territory, observing whether Black will prevent the crossover at 'a'. This kind of style which looks like "turtle's move" is indeed hard for common players to imitate];B[dm];W[cm]LB[dn:a][fm:b]C[If W32 at 'a', then B 'b'.]
;B[dl]C[B31 and B33: Black continues to expand his moyo at the bottom.];W[kp]C[The reduction of W34 is already imperative.];B[kq];W[jo];B[lp];W[ko];B[jq];W[lo];B[mp]C[The sequence from B35 to B41 is the steadiest and simplest answer, Black tries to keep balance with White in territory.];W[il]C[W42: White has reached his goal of reduction and runs away.];B[dg]
;W[df];B[ef]C[B43 and B45: Black compresses White and also keep the posture of "slow attack" to White on the lower side.];W[kk]C[W46: For White to strengthen with one more move is still necessary.];B[qi];W[qk];B[eb]LB[fb:a]C[B49: Black prevents White from attaching over at 'a'.];W[eg]C[White cuts at 50, Lee Changho starts to exert power, the fight in this area will be inevitable. After this move, it is time for noon break, the openings for both sides are very imposing, the situation is still very early.];B[dh]C[It is also inevitable for Black to fight with the extension of B51.];W[fg];B[cb]C[B53: Black probes White.]
;W[ec]C[W54 is the more tenacious resistance.];B[fb]LB[da:a][fd:b]C[B55: If Black ataris at 'a', then White will wedge at 'b', Black is not favorable.];W[da];B[gf];W[je]C[Although it is hard to judge whether W58 is a good or bad move, but from the proverb "Enemy's vital point is your vital point", this move is playable.];B[gg];W[qf]C[W60: White doesn't rigidly adhere to the local gains and losses and tenukis to grab the key point, it is a move that takes the whole game into account.];B[pf];W[qc]C[W62 is a good move, White does all he can to gain sente.]
;B[qe];W[ob];B[nc];W[oc];B[od];W[re];B[rf];W[rd];B[qg]C[Through 71, both sides have some gains. So far, White is leading in territory, Black is thick across the board, the potential for making territory is big, the outcome of the game is still unclear.];W[jh];B[hj]C[B73 is a move for attack and defense.];W[ip]LB[io:a][in:b][hn:c]C[W74 is alert, in sente preventing Black's tactic of B 'a', W 'b' and B 'c'.]
;B[iq];W[he]LB[fd:a]C[After W76, White is left with the tactic of playing the wedge at 'a'.];B[bf]C[B77 is an intense tesuji.];W[be]LB[bg:a][cc:b][dc:c]C[If W78 at 'a', then B 'b', W 'c' and B78, White is no good.];B[bg];W[ck]C[W80 is a good point which can't be let slip.];B[bd]C[B81 is an inevitable counter-attack.]
;W[ae];B[bb];W[cd]C[Through 84, Black has the tactic of playing a multi-stage ko in the corner.];B[id];W[ie];B[hd];W[gd];B[fd];W[kc];B[ic]C[The sequence from B85 to B91 looks crude, but in order to get sente, Black can't consider whether the shape is good or bad.];W[kb];B[cc]
;W[dc];B[ac]C[Through 95, it leads to a multi-stage ko and Black has no any burden, it seems that Black can fight.];W[ad];B[ce];W[bc];B[pm];W[qm];B[bd];W[de];B[af];W[bc];B[pc];W[pb]
;B[bd];W[ce];B[cg];W[bc];B[kd];W[jd];B[ge];W[le];B[bd];W[ca];B[ba]LB[ee:a][ea:b][ab:c]C[If B117 at 'a', then W117, B 'b', W 'c', it would become a double ko, Black is no good.]
;W[bc];B[rb];W[qb];B[bd];W[hp];B[hq];W[bc];B[qd];W[rc];B[bd];W[ab];B[aa];W[bc]
;B[jb];W[ld];B[bd];W[mo];B[np];W[bc];B[kf]LB[cl:a]C[B137: Black certainly should play the ko threat by pushing at 'a'.];W[ke];B[bd];W[cl]C[W140: White has completely eliminated many ko threats over here, it is a steady move, Stone Buddha's true character appears vividly on the board, Black is already not optimistic.];B[rj]
;W[rk];B[in];W[hn];B[hm];W[im];B[ho];W[gn];B[io];W[jn];B[go];W[hl]C[Through 152, Black already has no effective ko threats on the board.];B[km]C[B153 is an asking move.]
;W[lm]C[W154: White is not softhearted at all.];B[ea]C[B155: Black has no other choice but to reinitiate the ko.];W[bc];B[kl];W[ab]C[W158: White has eliminated the ko, White is taking a commanding lead in territory, Black has only one way to go: kill White's group in the center.];B[ll];W[jm];B[jk];W[ij]C[W162 is a tesuji to get out of trouble.];B[ik];W[hk]
;B[jj];W[gj];B[ii];W[fn]C[After W168, White's shape is not killable.];B[do];W[co];B[fk];W[fj];B[fl];W[ei];B[gk];W[hi];B[dj]
;W[ij];B[ej];W[hj];B[ih];W[dn];B[en];W[eo];B[em];W[gl]C[Through 186, Black's attack has failed in the end.];B[gh];W[mm];B[jg];W[ja]
;B[gc];W[nd]C[W192 is a declaration of victory.];B[ne];W[md];B[mf];W[dk];B[ek];W[ml];B[mk];W[kn]C[The series ties at 1:1, the game 3 will take place on 11/9 (2002).])
