Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[pd]C[So far this year, Gu Li almost lost all his games to Zhou Heyang (1 win and 5 defeats), in the fast games like NEC, it is perhaps  "the quick knife" Gu Li's best and last chance of this year.];W[dd];B[pp];W[dp];B[pj]C[The sanrensei opening is rarely seen nowadays, in Gu Li's games, it is more rarely seen. Perhaps it is one of Gu Li's traps designed against this "painful" opponent.]
;W[nc];B[pf];W[pb];B[jp];W[hq];B[ho];W[fq];B[pn];W[qc]LB[lp:a]C[W14: White can also directly invade at 'a'.];B[iq];W[hp];B[io]
;W[mf]C[W18: White expands his influence at the top.];B[li]C[B19 is an excellent point.];W[mh]LB[kk:a]C[White's sequence following W20 is not necessarily good, White can consider to reduce at around 'a' instead.];B[mi];W[oh];B[ph];W[oj];B[pi];W[nj]LB[nh:a]C[After W26, because of the wedge tactic at 'a', White's shape is thin.]
;B[nd]LB[oc:a]C[B27: Black can simply make the diagonal at 'a', White probably is more difficult to handle.];W[md];B[oc];W[ne];B[ob];W[re];B[od];W[og]C[W34 is to guard against the wedge and cut.];B[qf];W[rf]LB[rc:a]C[W36 is a mistake. White should simply strengthen at 'a' to make life.]
;B[qd];W[rd];B[rb]C[B37 and B39 are alert.];W[qb];B[rc];W[ra];B[sb];W[sd];B[rg];W[sc]LB[pa:a][sf:b]C[After the exchange, through W46, later on Black is kind of sente at both 'a'  and 'b'.]
;B[fc];W[cf];B[id]C[B47 and B49: Black is eyeing for White's big group from far away.];W[ol];B[ql];W[lk]C[White also has separated Black's two center stones with W52, the situation is still hard to judge.];B[bp];W[cp];B[cn];W[bo];B[bn];W[co]
;B[cj]C[Black's sequence from B53 to B50 is alert.];W[db];B[lm]C[After grabbing the vital point with B61, Black is a little favorable in the game.];W[if];B[kd];W[kf];B[ji];W[hi]C[With W66 White attempts to attack Black's three stones in the middle, this is just the losing cause of this game.];B[kk];W[kj];B[mk]C[B67 and B69 are tight and strong moves.]
;W[jk];B[kl];W[ki];B[le]LB[me:a][kh:b][jj:c][lh:d]C[B73 is good timing, if White connects at 'a', then B 'b', W 'c' and B 'd', the push and cut becomes effective.];W[ml];B[mm];W[ll];B[nl];W[lj]C[Therefore, with the sequence from W74 to W78, White elects to make compromise.]
;B[me]C[After Black cuts with B79, it leads to an exchange, Black is more practical. In terms for the whole game, Black's configuration is reasonable, Black can be considered favorable.];W[cl]C[W80: White initiates fight by using his thickness.];B[bl];W[bk];B[ck];W[bm];B[cm];W[al];B[dl];W[bl];B[bj];W[dk]
;B[el];W[an];B[aj];W[dn]C[But W90 and W94 are clearly damaging moves, perhaps Zhou 9p thinks of taking sente and is a little "careless".];B[dm];W[ao];B[ej];W[pq];B[oq];W[qp];B[qq];W[pr];B[or]
;W[qr];B[rp]LB[rq:a][op:b][po:c][nq:d][nr:e][mr:f][mq:g][os:h][ns:i]C[B105 is a strong move! If Black descends at 'a', then W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 'e', W 'f', B 'g', after W 'h' and W 'i' in sente, then W105, White's corner is huge.];W[kq]C[W106 is a thoughtful move.]
(;B[qo]LB[jq:a][rq:b][ro:c][ps:d][op:e][po:f][nr:g]C[B107: If Black blocks crossover at 'a', then W 'b', B 'c' and W 'd', Black destroys eye, W 'e', B 'f' and W 'g', White can make two eyes cleverly, thus Black can't take risk with B107 (see var a).];W[ir];B[eb]C[B109 is the last big point on the board.];W[ec];B[fb];W[fd]
;B[gd];W[ge];B[cc]C[B115 is good order.];W[dc];B[fe];W[ed];B[hd];W[bh]LB[cb:a][da:b][be:c][ae:d]C[W120 guards against the tactic of B 'a', W 'b', B 'c', White blocks and then B 'd', Black can escape to home.];B[dh]
;W[ch];B[eg];W[ff];B[nm];W[fh];B[eh];W[nk];B[fg];W[gg];B[fi]C[B131: Black strengthens the big dragon to make life.];W[oa];B[pa];W[rh]
;B[qg];W[sf];B[cb]C[B137: Black plays the strongest endgame.];W[da];B[be];W[bf];B[ce];W[de];B[cd];W[ad]C[W144: is a good killing move locally.];B[ae];W[ca]
;B[bb];W[ba];B[ef];W[ee];B[ac];W[bd];B[df];W[aa];B[gh]C[After Black cuts with B153, Black breaks through the defense ling with B155.];W[ig];B[hg];W[he];B[ih]
;W[jj];B[cg];W[bg];B[hh]C[After Black connects back several stones with B163, Black wins the game for sure.];W[mq];B[lf];W[lg];B[nf];W[lh];B[sg];W[pk];B[qk];W[na]
