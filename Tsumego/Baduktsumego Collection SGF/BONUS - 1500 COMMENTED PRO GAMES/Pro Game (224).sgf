Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[This is the first time I met with Lee Sedol in an official tournament. Lee Sedol didn't play well in this game, in the opening stage, he played several unreasonable moves, after I held tight to it, there almost was no good chance for him.];W[dd];B[pq];W[oc];B[dp];W[po]
;B[oo];W[on];B[op];W[pm];B[pe];W[qh];B[nd];W[mc];B[qo];W[qn];B[ro]C[The sequence from B1 to B17 is quite normal from both sides.];W[oh]LB[kd:a][md:b][me:c]C[But I think W18 is a questionable move. With this move, White's shape looks good, but after Black caps at 'a', White becomes very passive, therefore with W18, White should attach at 'b', after White hanes at 'c', afterwards White can seek a chance to reinforce at around 18.]

;W[ke]LB[jc:a]C[The pressing move of W32 is unreasonable! On the right side, Black is safe, White wants to get into fight strongly, it appears an overplay. White perhaps can only make the knight's move at 'a', leading the game to a prolonged war. But Lee Sedol is first-rated player, he probably plays this way to seek speed.];B[je];W[lg];B[jc];W[qb];B[nh];W[jf];B[ie];W[if];B[he];W[of];B[nf]
;W[hf]LB[ql:a][oi:b]C[W44 is again questionable, White should retreat at 'b', Black presses with several moves in a row and Black also gets to strike at 'a' in sente, Black is very happy.];B[lh];W[kg];B[oi];W[pi];B[oj];W[pj];B[ok];W[pk];B[ql];W[pl]
;B[fe]C[After Black jumps out with B55, Black's situation is not bad.];W[kj];B[mi];W[ji];B[lk];W[ec]LB[df:a]C[Not sure what the purpose of W60 is. After the game, Wang Lei 8p also thinks jumping at 'a' is better. In the game, Lee Sedol obviously think he is not favorable in the game, so he elects to play this way.];B[de];W[ce];B[df];W[cf];B[cg]
;W[dg]LB[cd:a]C[The cut of W66 is very unreasonable! Lee Sedol excessively uses power here. After Black's cut at 'a', White almost collapses. With W66, White can only connect at 'a', but even like this, White's situation is also not optimistic.];B[cd];W[bd];B[cc];W[bc];B[cb];W[dc];B[bg];W[be];B[bb];W[ab];B[ac]
;W[ad];B[ff];W[dh];B[ci];W[fh];B[fc];W[db];B[ed];W[fb]LB[da:a]C[W86 is a mistake! It is hard to believe that Lee Sedol didn't see the descent at 'a'. This way, White's shape would be much better.];B[da];W[eb];B[ba]C[In the game, After the atari of B87, Black makes a ko with B89, White is already very hard to give way as a whole.]

;W[aa]C[W116: White can only eliminate the ko, because White can't find any good ko threats.];B[di];W[fg];B[ch]C[Through B119, Black becomes very thick, however White's profit is very limited, Black establishes his superiority.];W[fq];B[dn];W[cq]C[After White approaches the corner with W120, White enters the corner immediately with W122, Lee Sedol is fighting desperately. Later on in a favorable consciousness, Black played some slow moves, almost giving up his advantage.];B[dq];W[dr];B[er];W[cr];B[eq]
;W[bo];B[bn];W[co];B[cn];W[do];B[eo];W[cp];B[fp];W[jq];B[ej]LB[gg:a][gh:b][hh:c]C[B137 is a big slow move! Black should hane at 'a', immediately attacking White in the center. Next W 'b' and B 'c', White is hard to handle. In the game, it equals to giving White the opportunity to take a breather.]
;W[mq];B[gg]LB[hi:a]C[After W138, Black again attacks with B139, White now can jump to 'a'. Here Black has incurred a big loss. Luckily Black's advantage earlier on is big, the situation is still to Black's advantage.];W[hi];B[qm];W[rl];B[qk];W[rk];B[pn];W[oe];B[ne];W[qn];B[kh]
;W[jh];B[pn];W[qj];B[qn];W[qf];B[ao];W[ap];B[an]C[After Black hanes and connects with B155 and B157, it is already hard for Black to lose this game.¡£];W[fr];B[es];W[gp];B[fn];W[or]
;B[pr];W[re]LB[ds:a][nn:b][kq:c]C[The diagonal extension of W164 is the losing move! White should block at 'a', because W164 looks like a sente advantage and White is very happy, but after the exchange with B 'b', it has a big impact to White in the lower side, Black's attachment of 'c' becomes effective. White's situation has been deteriorated.];B[lf];W[kf];B[nn];W[ds];B[kq];W[jr];B[aq];W[ar]
;B[gi];W[hh];B[gh];W[hl]C[White can only make the two-space jump of W176 in order to have a chance of winning, but it leaves some weakness.];B[go];W[hp];B[ho];W[ip];B[ko]LB[jl:a]C[B181: Now, if Black directly attacks with the knight's move at 'a', the game perhaps will be over very soon.];W[kn];B[jo]
;W[kr];B[jl];W[kk];B[kl];W[ij]LB[jk:a][il:b]TR[hl]C[W188: White originally thinks he can make an eye by playing at 'a', but if Black pushes at 'b' simply, W176 (the marked white stone) would get captured. Here we can see the improperness of W176. 

After this move, Black wins the game for sure, in this game Lee Sedol indeed didn't give a full play to his talent.];B[fs];W[gs];B[ep];W[ll];B[lm]
