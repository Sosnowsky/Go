;B[ce];W[nc];B[pc];W[jd];B[lc]LB[hc:a]C[The invasion of B11 is positive, the common move is to force at 'a'.];W[ld];B[kd];W[ke]C[W14: White has no other choices but to play atari from top, since White is not favorable in ladder.];B[kc];W[md];B[jc]
;W[id];B[hc];W[lf]C[W20 is thick play and Heyang's style.];B[kq]C[B21 splitting the bottom is the right move.];W[qf];B[qk]LB[hq:a]C[But B23 again splitting is questionable. To make extension at 'a' is clearly the biggest point, especially when W6 is in high position.];W[qm];B[qh];W[iq];B[nq];W[pq]
;B[no];W[mp];B[np];W[on]LB[lr:a]C[The knight of W32 is steady, but for White to play at 'a' immediately is more positive.];B[ko];W[co];B[dn];W[dk]C[White is able to grab the last big point with W34 and W36, White succeeds in the opening.];B[ci];W[ge];B[gc]
;W[cl];B[gm]LB[fm:a]C[The step of B41 is too big, to make small knight at 'a' is just the right move.];W[fn]C[The jump of W42 is severe, Black has a connection problem.];B[cq]C[B43 is a probe.];W[bp]LB[dq:a][bo:b][em:c]C[The diagonal of W44 is good move. If White blocks at 'a', Black will take advantage by playing hane at 'b' in sente, then make diagonal out at 'c'; If White descends at 'b', Black will sacrifice two stones and live the corner. White can't be satisfied with both results. In the game, W44 makes Black difficult to play.];B[bn];W[dq]
;B[bk];W[bl];B[fm];W[en];B[dm];W[bj];B[em];W[bi]C[Following B45, Black connects but pays a big price. First, Black gives White the corner. Secondly, White plays two consecutive moves of W52 and W54, Black is better dying than living!];B[jf];W[je];B[bq];W[bo];B[fj]
;W[cg];B[hr]C[The strike of B61 is game-deciding move. Black definitely can't win if proceeding normally.];W[ic]C[W62 is a forcing move in fast games, trying to get more time.];B[ib];W[ir]C[W64 is strong, White doesn't want to give an inch.];B[fr];W[er];B[gp];W[fq];B[do]LB[gq:a][ho:b]C[B69 is necessary order, if Black blocks at 'a', White will fly to 'b', Black is dangerous.]

(;W[hp]LB[jp:a][cp:b][kp:c]C[The diagonal of W70 is slow.

White should play diagonal at 'a', if Black still cuts at 'b', then W 'c', this is much better than the real game! If Black connects at 'c', please see variation a, White is also clearly better off.];B[cp]C[So far, although White's situation is better, the game becomes much closer.];W[cr];B[br];W[bs];B[ar];W[or]LB[pe:a][re:b][ob:c]C[W76: For White to make diagonal at 'a' is more urgent. If Black takes tenuki, White can make diagonal at 'b' and 'c', Black's corner is not completely alive, and the two-space extension of B23 and B25 also becomes thin.]
;B[jr];W[is];B[go];W[gq];B[rl];W[rm];B[rf]C[The attachment of B83 is good move locally.];W[re];B[pf];W[rg];B[qg];W[qe];B[pe]
;W[rd];B[rc];W[sf];B[rh];W[sd];B[if]C[From W84 to W94, White makes life. In terms of territory, Black didn't gain anything. However, after this exchange, Black becomes thick, then Black makes extension of B95. The roles of defense and offense have been switched.];W[lh];B[ji];W[og];B[pg];W[nr];B[bg]LB[hd:a][bf:b]C[Next the attachment of B101 is just right timing. Since White has defect at 'a', White can't play hane at 'b'.]
;W[bh];B[bf];W[ei];B[ej];W[dj];B[fi];W[eh];B[li];W[mi];B[lj]LB[kh:a][lg:b][ki:c][mg:d]C[B111 is slow. Black should hang at 'a', next W111, B 'b', W 'c' and B 'd', this way White has no certainty of success.]
;W[jh]C[White attaches with W112, the situation is slightly to White's advantage.];B[kh];W[kg];B[ki];W[jg];B[mh];W[od];B[pd];W[hh];B[ii];W[nh]LB[hg:a]C[But W122 is not simple and clear, making trouble for himself. White should double at 'a' and capture two stones completely, this is huge.]
;B[mg];W[nj];B[lg];W[mf];B[ng];W[nf];B[lh];W[oh];B[of];W[nl]LB[pk:a]C[W132 at 'a' is more tight.];B[hg]C[B133: Black escapes two stones, White still needs to make life in gote, the situation again becomes closer.]
;W[kf];B[gg];W[mc];B[kb];W[oe];B[nn];W[om];B[mr]C[B141 is big counter-sente endgame.];W[ho]LB[in:a]C[W142 is the last losing move. If White makes knight at 'a', this will be still a close game.];B[sm];W[sn]
;B[sl];W[rn];B[sh];W[sg];B[dg];W[ch];B[df];W[ff];B[fg]LB[ih:a]C[The exchange of W152 and B153 should be preserved, later on to connect at 'a' is still sente.];W[he];B[in]C[B155: Black encloses territory in the center, Black's small victory can't be altered.]

;B[hj];W[qb];B[ob];W[rb];B[nm];W[ol];B[ml]LB[mb:a]C[B173 and B175: For Black to hane over at 'a' is bigger. Finally Black is leading 7 points on the board.];W[ma];B[rj];W[ka];B[jb];W[lr]
