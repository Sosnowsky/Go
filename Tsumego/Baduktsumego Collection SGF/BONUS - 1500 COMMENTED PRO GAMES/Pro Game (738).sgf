;B[pi];W[pg];B[rd];W[qe];B[qd]C[The sequence from B17 to B23 appeared recently in the game between Lee Changho and Hu Yaoyu, Hu won that game, Lee Changho uses this again and apparently he had some new study.];W[nd];B[qi];W[of];B[nc];W[mc];B[oc];W[ri];B[rh]
;W[rj];B[qh];W[pj];B[oi];W[rg]C[However, in the real game, the sequence up to W36 is not necessarily to Black's advantage.];B[md]C[B37: If Black doesn't cut, Black has to escape on his own and it is clearly not to Black's advantage.];W[mf]LB[ld:a][mj:b]C[The exchange order of W38 and B 'a' is wrong, White should simply net at 'b', Black is difficult.];B[ld];W[mj];B[ng]
;W[nf];B[mi];W[li];B[nj];W[mh];B[ni]LB[kf:a][qm:b]C[Black simply sticks the head out with B43, B45 and B47. White is left with two vital points 'a' and 'b' and White can't look after both.];W[lj];B[nk];W[kf];B[qm];W[ol]
;B[nl];W[pn]C[To counterattack B51, White sticks the head out with W52 and W54.];B[pl];W[pm]LB[ok:a][om:b][on:c]C[But after B55 and B57, White is very painful! If White simply retreats at 'a' with W56, White worries B 'b', W56 and B 'c', Black takes sente by sacrificing, since who gets to act first at the top will make a big difference.];B[rl];W[ok];B[nm]LB[nn:a][om:b][ll:c]C[B59 is heavy, Black should jump to 'a' instead, White can also only connect at 'b', next B 'c', this way Black may obtain sente.]
;W[om];B[qo];W[nn];B[mn];W[no];B[mo];W[np];B[ll];W[nq];B[or];W[kp]C[White gets to stick head out from W62 to W70.];B[jl]C[However the jump of B71 can't be omitted.]
;W[jd]C[After White gets to play W72, the situation is unclear.];B[dc]LB[db:a]C[B73: For Black to make the knight's move at 'a' is better.];W[cc];B[cb];W[ec];B[db];W[ed];B[eb];W[bc];B[hc];W[gd]
;B[gc];W[bj];B[ep]LB[eq:a]C[When B85, White can only tolerate by playing at 'a'.];W[fp]C[White's sequence following W86 is mistake.];B[fo];W[go];B[eq];W[er];B[gn];W[fn];B[eo]
;W[hn];B[gm];W[ho];B[hm];W[jn];B[im]LB[jo:a]C[After B99, Black is left with the excellent tesuji at 'a', White has no time to strengthen, White is in a losing situation.];W[cj];B[fr];W[dr];B[dj];W[di];B[ej]
;W[dh];B[jo];W[ko];B[in];W[io];B[gp];W[gq];B[ip];W[jp];B[hp];W[iq];B[jo];W[hq]C[From W108 to W118, White painfully gives up three stones in order to crossover.]
;B[lq]LB[jc:a]C[B119: Black follows up the victory with hot pursuit, it is a mistake, if Black attaches at 'a' instead, Black will win the game.];W[lc]C[W120: Black takes tenuki and crawls out, it is huge, the situation becomes chaotic.];B[nr];W[qn];B[rn];W[kq];B[kc]LB[jb:a]C[Following B125, Black connects in dame moves and incurs a big loss, Black should sacrifice two stones by playing at 'a', this way the game would be still to Black's advantage.];W[kb];B[kd]
;W[jc];B[je];W[ib];B[ke];W[nb];B[ob];W[mb];B[lr];W[sh];B[ne];W[kh];B[fd];W[hb]C[White crawls in sente with W140 and also obtains 5 points, the situation has been turned around.]
