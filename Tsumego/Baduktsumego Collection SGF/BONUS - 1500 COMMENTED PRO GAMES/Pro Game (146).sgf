;B[jp];W[qn];B[fc];W[hc]LB[qq:a]C[W10: White has the state of mind to take tenuki and attach at 'a' instead.];B[po];W[rp];B[ql];W[pn];B[qq]C[B15 is a move that was first played by some young players in China, it is a very interesting move.];W[pl]C[The attachment of W16 is the right move.];B[pk]
;W[qk]LB[ol:a][qj:b][ok:c]C[But the cut of W18 is rarely seen nowadays, the common play is to extend at 'a', next B 'b' and W 'c'.];B[ol];W[rl];B[pm];W[qm];B[df]LB[on:a]C[B23: For Black to hang at 'a' is steady, I think this way Black already can be satisfied.
];W[fd]C[W24: If White takes the ko in the lower right corner, White's tempo seems a little slow.];B[gd]
;W[gc];B[rk]C[B27: Black starts the ko, it is good timing!
];W[pl];B[ed];W[fe];B[ee];W[ec];B[ql];W[qj]LB[fb:a][oo:b]C[W34: White has the state of mind to take at 'a', if Black takes at 34, then White can hane at 'b'.];B[fb]
;W[dc];B[rm];W[pl];B[ff];W[ge];B[ql];W[oo];B[sl];W[om];B[nm]C[B45 is intense, but Black also takes some risk.];W[pl];B[he]C[B47: Black finds a good ko threat and also it is a local tesuji.]
;W[gf];B[pm];W[on];B[hd];W[id]C[W52 is the only move.];B[ic];W[ib];B[ie];W[gg];B[jd];W[gb];B[nq]C[B59 is strong and unyielding, it seems Chang Hao wants to get rid of his weak image in Go fans.]
;W[pl];B[ga];W[hb];B[pm];W[nl];B[pl];W[nk]C[W64 and W66 are also very extreme, Choi Cheolhan becomes "violent".];B[mm]C[B67: Black also has no other choice, the attack and defense here will be the key for the game.];W[pj];B[rj];W[mp];B[ln]C[After the diagonal of B71, it seems White is very dangerous.
]
;W[np];B[mq];W[lp];B[ko];W[lq]LB[pp:a]C[The turn of W76 is a strong move, taking one stone at 'a' normally can't be satisfied.
];B[rn]LB[qo:a]C[The crawl of B77 was regarded unanimously in the study room as a weak play, Black's push and cut at 'a' to kill White is relentless and ferocious, we have studied many variations, it seems White is always unfavorable.];W[qo];B[rq];W[jq]C[With the attachment of W80, White's pain goes way and now comes the sweet part, White's situation takes a better turn.]
;B[iq];W[jr];B[lr];W[kr];B[mr];W[hq];B[ir];W[hr];B[ip];W[is];B[dq]LB[gp:a]C[B91: For Black to seal off by the digonal extension at 'a' is the most strongest response, next White pushes and cuts, the variation would be very complicated, Black seems more dangerous.];W[hp]C[White attaches out happily with W92, many pros including Yu Bin 9p and Kong Jie 7p all think Black's attack fails, Black failed to take control of the game at one stroke when he had a chance, the situation becomes complicated.]
;B[ep];W[hn];B[lk];W[cq]C[With the hane of W96, the situation has been turned around.];B[do];W[cp];B[dn];W[cm];B[dm];W[dl]LB[co:a]C[W100 and W102 are very strong, to connect at 'a' is common.];B[co]
;W[bo];B[bn];W[bp];B[cl];W[bm];B[bl];W[an];B[fn]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.

Black's remaining time: 1 hour and 38 minutes.
White's remaining time: 2 hour and 22 minutes.];W[dk];B[fl];W[dr];B[fr]LB[cj:a][ej:b][gk:c][ck:d][gh:e]C[(Note: Lee Sedol 9p thinks B115 is a very big questionable move, Black should play at 'a' next W 'b', B 'c', W 'd' and B 'e'.)]
;W[hl];B[dj]C[Black tangles with White with B117, here Black can't allow White to get away easily.];W[ej];B[ek];W[ck];B[gh]LB[di:a]C[The attachment of B121 is a very cunning and confusing move, but if White calmly captures at 'a' in a ladder, Black seems to have nothing to gain. ];W[fg]C[The turn of B122 is a big bad move.];B[ei]LB[cj:a][bk:b]C[B123 is a careless move, Black should attach at 'a' first, to exchange with W 'b', then play B123 and B125, this way White is very hard to handle.]
;W[fj];B[gj];W[fi];B[fh];W[eh]LB[di:a]C[W128: White should atari at 'a', in the game White has no assurance of success in the ko fight.];B[cj];W[bk]LB[di:a]C[W130: if White takes at 'a' simply, White is already favorable.];B[eg];W[gi];B[dh]
;W[hh];B[eh];W[hi];B[hg];W[ef];B[gs];W[de]LB[hs:a][ok:b]C[W140: For White to answer the ko at 'a' is more tenacious, next White can find the ko threat at 'b', this way the situation would be very complicated.

(Note from tom.weiqi.com: W140 is the losing move, White certainly should connect at 'a', this way Black is hard to play.)];B[hs];W[bj]C[In the real game, through W142, a big exchange has resulted, Black gains a lot in territory, White's situation is dangerous.];B[jb]
;W[eb];B[nd]C[With the jump of B145, just one move to protect the top, some pros think White is already sentenced to "death".];W[kc];B[jc];W[le]C[W148: White releases the game-deciding move.];B[mf]C[(Note from tom.weiqi.tom: with B149 Black elects the most strong and unyielding move, in this game 2 Chang Hao looks like a completely different person from the game 1.)];W[lf];B[lg]C[Black is not soft-hearted at all with B149 and B151, White may speed up to death.];W[mg];B[me]LB[kg:a][lh:b][ld:c][kf:d]C[(Note from tom.weiqi.com: if W 'a', then B 'b', W 'c' and B 'd', White will die.)]
;W[kg];B[lh];W[kd];B[kh];W[jg];B[lb];W[mh];B[kj]C[(Note from weiqi.tom.com: after the diagonal of B161, White has no way to escape.)];W[jh];B[kf]LB[jf:a][of:b][ph:c]C[(Note from weiq.tom.com: B163 is a good move, if White answers at 'a', then Black will happily win the game by playing at either 'b' or 'c'.)]
;W[qh];B[qi];W[pi];B[ri];W[jf];B[ph];W[nf];B[ld];W[ke]C[If Black elects to sacrifice the top and kill White on the right side, Black also will win the game by a big margin.];B[oh];W[lc];B[mb];W[kb]
