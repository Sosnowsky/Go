Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.]RE[W+R];B[pd]C[In the first round of Mingren Title, I met with Teacher Nie, in this game, Teacher Nie played very well, it looks like he came back to his prime time.];W[dp];B[pq];W[cd];B[ec]

;B[fd];W[gb];B[cg]C[The sequence from B9 to B21 was a very popular joseki in the past.];W[qf];B[qh]LB[qj:a][pi:b]C[The low one-space pincer of B23 is a little questionable, after White invades at 'a', Black is a little difficult. With B23 Black should play the two-space high pincer at 'b'.];W[qj];B[pi]LB[pj:a]C[B25: For Black to press at 'a' is tight and still good, in the game, I'm reluctant to allow White to cross over easily, but I didn't expect Teacher Nie takes tenuki, Black already has no good follow-up maneuver.];W[op];B[oq]
;W[np];B[mq];W[qq];B[pp]LB[fq:a]C[The sequence following B31 is the most common variation, with B31 for Black to first approach the corner at 'a' is also playable, it wouldn't be severe even if White plays another move in the lower right corner.];W[po];B[qp];W[rp];B[rq];W[nq];B[nr];W[qr];B[or]
;W[rr];B[ro];W[sq];B[oo];W[rn];B[on];W[gq]C[The sequence up to the extension of B45 can be imagined, after White grabs the big knight's move with W46, Black is not optimistic for the game.];B[qc]LB[nc:a]C[The corner-diagonal of B47 is questionable, to make the knight's move at 'a' is the original move.];W[mp];B[lq];W[lp]
;B[kp];W[ln];B[ko];W[mm];B[iq];W[of]LB[mc:a][pj:b]C[When White jumps with W56, the problem of B47 can be easily seen, Black wants badly to make an extension at 'a', but after White pushes at 'b', Black perhaps will collapse.];B[pj];W[nd]C[But in the place where White takes tenuki two times, and White still can play the knight's move of W58, Black indeed can't be satisfied!];B[ne]C[Although Black has no certainty of success with the crosscut of B59, but since being pressured by position Black has no other choice.];W[oe]
;B[od];W[nc];B[me];W[rd];B[rc];W[ng];B[lc];W[lb];B[mk];W[ob]LB[nb:a]C[The diagonal of W70 is questionable, White should descend at 'a'.];B[re];W[qe]
;B[qd];W[rf];B[sd];W[lh];B[ll];W[pb];B[qb]LB[nb:a][mb:b]C[Through B79, the position of W70 at 'a' is clearly better, in the game Black is left with the hane move at 'b' and half of White's stones may only make life, the difference has been narrowed down a lot.];W[sf];B[se];W[ed];B[dd]
;W[jq]C[W84 is an asking move.];B[kn]C[B85: Black captures White completely, locally White incurs a loss.];W[pn];B[pm];W[so];B[nm];W[ip];B[kg]C[B91: Black wants to run out from the root, even paying a small price is still acceptable.];W[lg];B[kf];W[kh];B[ig]
;W[jh];B[hf];W[lf];B[le];W[kb];B[kc];W[jd];B[ke];W[km];B[lm];W[gh];B[gg];W[fg]
;B[ii]LB[hh:a]C[B109 is careless, it is the losing move! Black should simply hang at 'a', now only if Black escapes and makes life, Black would win the game, even if Black wants to start the ko, Black needs to find a proper time.];W[ih];B[hh];W[hi];B[gi];W[hg];B[mb];W[mc];B[hh];W[sb];B[sc];W[hg]
;B[jb];W[ma];B[hh];W[jg];B[fh];W[if];B[cn];W[hj];B[ie];W[hg];B[ka];W[nb];B[ig]
;W[jf];B[cq]LB[gj:a]C[B135 entering the corner is the last losing move, at any rate Black should attach at 'a'! By developing the left side, Black perhaps still has a chance.];W[cp];B[dq];W[ep];B[eq];W[bp];B[fq];W[fp];B[gr];W[hq];B[dl]
;W[br];B[bq];W[aq];B[cr];W[hr];B[cs];W[gj]C[After the turn of W152, Black's defeat is already certain.];B[dj];W[fe];B[dc];W[cm];B[dm];W[bn]
