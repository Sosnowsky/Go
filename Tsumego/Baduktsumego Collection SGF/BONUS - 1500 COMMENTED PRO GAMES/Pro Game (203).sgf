(;W[cm]LB[cn:a][dr:b][cq:c][dg:d][fc:e][ck:f]C[W10 is a recently popular play, if White plays the knight's move at 'a', then B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e' and B 'f', White can not be satisfied (see var a).];B[cq];W[dq];B[cp];W[do];B[co];W[dr]LB[cn:a]C[W16 is a strong move, if White hits at 'a', then Black can hane underneath with B16 and connect in sente, White is not favorable.]

;B[fp]C[Through 29, the resulting position is the same as that of a second round game between Chang Hao and Yoo Changhyeok in 7th Samsung Cup.];W[el]LB[fm:a][fk:b]C[W30: In that game, Chang Hao elected to clamp at 'a' and Black sticked his head out, leading to a complicated fight, in the postgame analysis, Chang Hao thought White's large jump move at 'b' is more steady, the play of W30 in this game is not good.];B[gm]C[B31 is a good move.];W[lq]LB[gk:a]C[W32: If White knights at 'a', then Black will make a checking extension at 32, White is discontent.];B[fl]C[Black is very happy with the tiger of B33.];W[fk];B[gk];W[fj]

(;B[ci]LB[hg:a][ff:b][bj:c]C[B41: Black should first knight at 'a' to exchange for White's jump at 'b', then B41. In addition, when B 'a', if White hanes at 'c', then Black can knight conceal at 'b', White is clearly no good (see var a).];W[gh];B[hh];W[hg];B[ih];W[ig];B[jh];W[jg];B[kg];W[kf]

;W[nb]LB[qk:a]C[W64 seems an overplay, making the splitting move at 'a' is commonsense.];B[ob];W[mb];B[qk]C[After B67, how White to reduce Black's big moyo on the right side is the key for the game.]

Moreover, when W 'c', if Black counteracts with the hane at 'm', then White can cut at 'i', followed by B 'j', W 'g', B 'd', W 'e', B 'c', W 'n', B 'o' and W 'p', this is also favorable for White (see var b).]
