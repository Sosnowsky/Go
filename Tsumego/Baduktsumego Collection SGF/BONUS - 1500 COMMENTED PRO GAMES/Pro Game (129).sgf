;W[de];B[dh];W[gd];B[fq]C[B9: Black elects to tenuki and double approach the corner, which is a trend.];W[fp];B[gp];W[fo];B[eq];W[dq];B[go];W[fn];B[ck];W[co]LB[cc:a]C[W18: White wants to obtain sente and attach the corner at 'a'.]
;B[ce];W[dg]LB[cf:a][cd:b]C[As to the attachment of B19, the counter-attachment of W20 is a good move at this situation, if White hanes at 'a', then Black will retreat to 'b', White seems tasteless.]
(;B[df]LB[dd:a][ch:b][di:c][cf:d][ee:e][be:f][ef:g][cg:h]C[The wedge of B21 is driven by state of mind, if Black hits at 'a', then W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 'e', W 'f', B21 and W 'g', this would more fit White's tempo (see var a). Black can consider to extend at 'd', then W 'h', Black pushes out at 21 (see var b). These two variations are all better than the real game.];W[cf];B[ef];W[cd];B[be];W[dd]
;B[cg]LB[bd:a][cc:b]C[B27: Black should first turn at 'a', White most likely will answer at 'b', then Black cuts at 27, White is hard to reinforce.];W[bd];B[bf];W[fc]C[Through 30, Black's configuration is not good, Black has already suffered a loss.];B[nq];W[kp]LB[qn:a][kq:b][oc:c]C[After the approach of B31, the pincer of W32 is unnecessary. White only needs to defend at 'a' steadily, Black will make the extension on the side at 'c', then White approaches the corner at 'c', White can be satisfied.];B[qn]
;W[pn];B[pm];W[on];B[qq];W[qo];B[pq];W[qm];B[oc]C[With the sequence of B33 to B41, Black gets to protect his corner and is in a good tempo.];W[hr]C[W42 is the vital point for shape.];B[hq];W[gr];B[gq]
;W[iq];B[ip];W[jq];B[dn];W[do];B[lq]C[However, Black counterattacks with B51 and also looks after himself, this is Cho Chikun's top-rate unique thinking.];W[hm]LB[in:a][dk:b]C[W52: Perhaps White thinks he has already obtained profit in the upper left corner, White becomes conservative. White certainly should occupy the vital point at 'a', so White can first probe Black by playing the attachment at 'b'.];B[jn];W[lp]LB[mp:a][jo:b]C[W54: White first should peep at 'a', because the diagonal's move at 'b' is  absolutely sente.]

;W[ng]LB[ob:a][nb:b]C[W92 is also questionable. White first should hane at 'a then connect at 'b', but the biggest questionable move is W96!];B[nb];W[mb];B[ob];W[mc]LB[lc:a][md:b]TR[hc]C[W96: White should hang at 'a', if Black hits and cuts at 'b', then White takes the chance to capture the marked black stone, White should have nothing to complain.];B[jd];W[ke]

(;B[hh]LB[hf:a][kb:b][jb:c][ic:d][gh:e][hd:f][bo:g]C[B125 almost becomes the losing move! Black should jump to 'a', then W125, B 'b', W 'c', Black hits at 'd' in sente and hane at 'e', White can capture two black stones at 'f', Black ataris at 'g', this way the game would be still to Black's advantage (see var a).];W[hf];B[ig];W[hg];B[ge];W[id]C[After the knight's move of W126, W130 is a good move! Perhaps Cho Chikun has neglected this move, Black's five stones get killed and Black has suffered a big loss.]
