;W[di];B[ck];W[co];B[cn];W[cp]LB[cq:a]C[When Black forces with B9, White attaches with W10 and retreats with W12, it is vital, if Black gets to play at 'a', the difference is very big.];B[ef];W[fd];B[bd];W[cc];B[hd]C[B17 is strong and unyielding, showing Black is eager to get into fight.];W[dg]
;B[df];W[he]C[The counterattack of W20 is inevitable.];B[id];W[ge];B[bi]C[B23: Black has to cross over.];W[kd];B[ie]
(;W[nd]LB[if:a][ke:b][je:c][jd:d][jf:e][kc:f][ld:g][lc:h][md:i]C[W26: White can also hane at 'a', followed by B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f', W 'g', B 'h' and W 'i', White takes outside influence and Black gains territory (see var a).];B[if]C[In the game Black sticks his head out with B27 in sente, it leads to a direct confrontation.];W[gg];B[pf]
;W[nf];B[ph]C[Black gains territory with B29 and B31, seeing how White to attack Black's four stones at the top.];W[ih];B[ke];W[le];B[kg]C[B33 and B35 are good move, White feels a little difficult.];W[kf];B[lf];W[je];B[jf];W[lg];B[ke]C[With the sequence from W34 to W40, White plans to destroy Black at one stroke, it seems far-fetched, White's possibility of winning this ko is very little.]
;W[qe];B[pe];W[kf];B[ec];W[fc]C[W46: White doesn't want to allow Black to take advantage in sente, but this gives Black many ko threats.];B[ke];W[qc];B[pc]LB[pb:a]C[The exchange of W48 and B49 is not good timing, it should be reserved. If White gives up the ko later on, White can live one group by striking inside at 'a'.];W[kf];B[ed];W[eb]
;B[ke];W[bh];B[fe];W[hg]LB[gd:a]C[W56: For White to connect at 'a' is better, in the game White doubles up with W56, since Black's cut at 'a' is sente, White's several stones in the center appear too heavy.];B[ch];W[kf];B[hf]C[The push of B59 is alert and good order.];W[gf];B[ke];W[ci];B[bg]

;B[gd];W[gc];B[jd];W[rb];B[nc];W[ob];B[me]C[So far, an exchange has resulted, Black becomes thick. Although White gains some territory, but White in the center seems weak.];W[dk];B[dl];W[el];B[ek];W[dj];B[dm]
;W[fk]C[White first strengthen himself with W84 to W90.];B[oq];W[ld];B[mf];W[md];B[ne];W[oc]C[With the sequence from W92 to W96, White continues to adopt his strategy of taking territory, the tempo is slow, but it is very substantial.];B[pl];W[kh];B[lh];W[ki];B[kq]
;W[oo];B[np];W[qo];B[pp]LB[rp:a]C[B105: To play at 'a' is better for attacking.];W[qm];B[ql];W[rn]C[W106 and W108 are good moves to make eyes.];B[rl];W[rp];B[rq];W[om]C[So far White basically has a living shape.]
;B[hq];W[hr];B[gr];W[fr];B[gp];W[gs];B[fq]C[It is hard to judge whether the sequence from B113 to B119 is good or bad.];W[gr];B[mm]C[B121 is fierce and relentless, the defense and offense over here will decide the game.];W[ol];B[ok];W[mn]
;B[nn]C[B125 is the best answer.];W[no];B[mo];W[ln];B[nm];W[mp];B[lo];W[po];B[qr]LB[qq:a]C[B133 guards against White's cut at 'a'.];W[nl];B[kn]
;W[lm];B[ml];W[nk];B[kl];W[ko];B[lp];W[km];B[jm];W[jn];B[ll]C[Black is very happy to wrap up with the sequence from B135 to B145.];W[kn];B[im];W[jp]
;B[mj]C[B149: Black continues to attack, Black takes the initiative.];W[mq];B[jq];W[iq];B[lq];W[oj];B[pj];W[pm];B[sm];W[mr];B[lr];W[jr];B[nq]
;W[mi];B[lj];W[li];B[nj];W[pk];B[qj];W[oi];B[ni];W[nh];B[oh]C[After B171, White already can't make life locally.];W[jl]C[W172: White makes the last-ditch effort.];B[mg]
;W[mh];B[kj];W[il];B[qk]C[B177: Why Black doesn't stick his head first in the center? It is inexplicable.];W[ij]C[W178: White has a chance of winning again.];B[ok];W[bj];B[ai];W[pk];B[jj];W[hl];B[ok]
;W[cj];B[ji];W[jh];B[ii];W[hi];B[hj];W[gi];B[pi]C[Black eliminates the ko with B193, White has to capture all black stones in the lower left in order to have a chance to win this game.];W[cl];B[dp]C[Black's tactic of making life with the sequence following B195 is very brilliant.];W[eq];B[cq]

;B[bm];W[ck];B[bn];W[bo];B[fq];W[dr];B[ho];W[hp];B[hm]C[B217 and B219 are winning moves, White can't kill Black cleanly. Because Black has many local ko threats, so by ko-living White already has no chance of winning.];W[gm];B[gn];W[fm];B[io]
