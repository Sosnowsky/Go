;W[hc];B[oc];W[cf]LB[qj:a]C[W8: For White to split at 'a' is relatively common, and it also easily forms a close game.];B[pj]C[After Black connects together with B9, the situation becomes a moyo fight.];W[kc];B[fq];W[cn];B[mq];W[qq]LB[hq:a]C[The strike of W14 is too early, to invade at 'a' is relatively normal.]

B43 is too conservative, it seems after Black captures the corner Black has favorable consciousness.];W[fr];B[gq];W[lo]LB[rm:a]C[W46: White should strike at 'a', this is the best timing, Black is very difficult to answer.];B[ko]
