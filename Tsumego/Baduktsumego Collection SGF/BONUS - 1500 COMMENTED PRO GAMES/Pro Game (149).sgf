;W[pp];B[qp];W[oq];B[qn];W[pn];B[pm];W[qq];B[pr];W[rq];B[op]C[In the lower-right corner, the avalanche joseki was played, the cut of B15 is a popular and new move in recent two years, it is still under study.];W[np];B[rr];W[oo]

;W[mm];B[ml];W[nn];B[sn];W[lm]C[Through W36, both side have gained some profit locally.];B[dp]C[But Black is able to grab the empty corner with B37, Black still keeps the efficiency of playing first.];W[oc]LB[lk:a][od:b]C[W38: For White to capture one stone at 'a' is also a thick play, but later on White may come to nothing. The approach of W38 seeks substantial result, but it seems White should approach high at 'b', echoing White's stones in the middle, this way White becomes more balanced for the whole game.];B[od];W[nd];B[nc]LB[mk:a][pe:b]C[B39 and B41 are good moves, when B39 if Black simply extends at 'a', White can press at 'b', Black is being snubbed.]
;W[mc];B[nb];W[pd];B[oe];W[pc];B[pe];W[qc];B[re];W[rd];B[qe];W[md];B[mb];W[lb]C[Through W54, Black accumulates full strength.]
;B[mk]C[Black extends out with B55 to start attack.];W[mi]LB[mf:a][nh:b]C[W56: White has to dive in like this, if White simply jumps to 'a', which is the original move, Black can seal off big territory at 'b', White's territory is clearly inadequate.];B[le];W[kd];B[rc];W[rb];B[sd]C[B59 and B61 taking one stone is good timing.];W[ob]LB[qb:a][qa:b][ra:c][sb:d][pb:e][pa:f][kb:g]C[With the block of W62, although Black is left with the tactic of B 'a', W 'b' and B 'c', but it is still a tight and original move, since if White descends at 'd', Black can turn at 62, next W 'e', B 'f' is sente, then Black can clamp at 'g', White is not comfortable.]
;B[kk];W[ki];B[ij];W[jm];B[kl]LB[jk:a]C[The play of B67 is a little damaging, Black has no other choice in order to guard against White's crosscut at 'a'. ];W[in];B[ih];W[nf];B[oh];W[nj];B[nk];W[pi]LB[oj:a][ne:b][mf:c]C[W74: If White retreats at 'a', White can guard against Black's push at 'b' and 'c', but as to professional players who stress on territory, most likely it will be played as in the real game.]
;B[ne];W[me];B[mf];W[nh]LB[lf:a][mg:b][lg:c][ke:d][oj:e]C[W78: If White plays atari at 'a', B 'b' and W 'c', next B78 is a good move, then Black has good moves at 'd' and 'e', White is difficult to look after both sides.

In the game, W78 is the most tenacious resistance.];B[ng];W[mg];B[of];W[lf]
;B[ol]LB[lg:a]C[B83 looks insipid but is a very good move, calmly forcing White to connect at 'a'.];W[nf];B[qb];W[qa];B[mf];W[hi]LB[ce:a]C[White counterattacks resolutely with W88! For White to play at 'a' is more substantial.];B[dc]C[The attachment of B89 is alert.];W[nf]LB[cc:a][cd:b][ec:c][ed:d]C[W90: If White hanes the corner at 'a', Black will cut at 'b', if White plays hane at 'c', Black will cut at 'd'.]
;B[cd];W[og]LB[lg:a]C[White needs to be very careful, otherwise Black can ignite the bomb at any time, so White has to eliminate the hidden troubles with W90 and W92, allowing Black to play three consecutive moves in the upper-left corner.

After this move, it is time for lunch break.];B[ed];W[de];B[ce];W[df];B[fc]C[As a result of the exchange up to B97, we can easily see the improperness of W88. So far Black is leading in territory.];W[cf];B[ko];W[km];B[ip]
;W[fp];B[mo];W[mn]LB[lq:a]C[The play of W104 is weird and looks like a play in a winning game, now to make knight's move at 'a' seems working.];B[lq];W[fn];B[cn];W[nr];B[hr];W[fr];B[mr];W[cq];B[cp]
;W[dq];B[ck]C[Through B115, Black's tempo is smooth.];W[cj];B[bj];W[bi];B[bk]LB[ci:a][ic:b]C[B119: Black can first consider to play atari at 'a', then connect at 119, this way Black can grab the last big point at 'b' on the upper side.];W[pg];B[sb];W[ra];B[rg]
;W[hc]C[W124: White grabs the last big point.];B[ci];W[ch];B[dj];W[eb];B[ec];W[fb]C[White again obtains territory with W128 and W130, the situation becomes closer.];B[db];W[gc];B[ff];W[fg];B[gg]LB[eg:a]C[B135: For Black to play at 'a' seems better.]
;W[fh];B[dh];W[dg];B[gh];W[gi];B[fi];W[ei];B[fj];W[be];B[bd];W[bg];B[eg];W[eh]
;B[ef];W[di];B[ej];W[cj];B[kb];W[gf]C[B153: When Black finds ko threat, the cut of W154 is a surprising strong move.];B[ci];W[dh];B[gd];W[ee];B[lc];W[ld];B[la]
;W[bb];B[ae];W[bf];B[cb];W[bc];B[cc];W[hd];B[kc];W[da]C[Through W170, White gains a little profit in the big exchange, now the situation is not clear.];B[ho];W[gn];B[hf];W[ge]

;W[ab];B[ji];W[ib];B[jf];W[oa];B[pb];W[gk];B[hk];W[gj]LB[ig:a]C[W194 and W196 are the last losing move, when W194 and W196, if White attaches at 'a', the outcome of the game is still hard to imagine.];B[gl];W[ig]LB[jg:a][ie:b][na:c][if:d][jh:e]C[W198 is tesuji, next if Black blocks at 'a', White can peep at 'b' in sente, then crawl at 'c', Black is not good; Moreover if Black connects at 'a', White has a good squeezing move at 'e'.]
;B[hh]C[However, the connection of B199 is calm, perhaps White had illusions here.

So far, Black wins the game for sure.];W[jg];B[jb];W[fl];B[gm];W[fm];B[fk];W[hn];B[il];W[gp];B[ir];W[jo];B[jp]
