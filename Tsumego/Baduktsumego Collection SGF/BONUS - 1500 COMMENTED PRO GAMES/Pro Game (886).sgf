;B[iq];W[oc];B[ld]C[Through B9, the opening is same as that in game 1];W[nd]LB[gc:a]C[W10: White varies first, in game 1, White defended the corner with large knight at 'a'.];B[pf];W[nf]LB[qb:a][jc:b]C[W12 is rarely seen, the common move is to make knight at 'a' or pincer at 'b'.];B[ic]LB[pc:a][jd:b]C[B13 is steady, if Black directly makes diagonal at 'a', White perhaps will pincer-attack at around 'b', it immediately leads to a fierce fight.]
;W[gc];B[pc];W[lf];B[ie];W[qh]C[W18 is a mutual good point.];B[mc];W[pb]C[Following W20, White aims to obtain sente.];B[qb];W[pd];B[qc];W[oh]C[Through W24, White seals off, it seems White has nothing to complain.];B[no]C[B25 is the vital point for moyo of both sides.]
;W[pq];B[cf]C[Through B27, Black's moyo is relatively broad, how White to reduce is the key for the situation.

After this move, it is time for noon break.];W[ee]LB[cd:a]C[W28 is surprising, to double up at 'a' is general thinking.];B[dj]C[B29: Black gets to play on both sides, Black's shape is vivid.];W[fp];B[eo]LB[dq:a][dn:b]C[B31 is a very thoughtful move, to make diagonal at 'a' or make knight at 'b' is usual answer.];W[dq];B[cq]
;W[fo];B[fn];W[gn];B[en];W[ho];B[jp]C[B39: Black strengthens and guards against White's invasion, which is the right move.];W[bd]C[W40 is both defensive and offensive move, White tries to keep balance in territory.];B[qg]C[B41: Black aims to fix shape.];W[rg];B[rf];W[pg];B[qf]
;W[of]C[Through W46, both sides gain some profit.];B[on];W[pm];B[in]C[B49 is the vital point for attacking.];W[gm];B[ep];W[eq];B[gr];W[gq];B[fr];W[fq]C[After this move, the game was closed for the first day.];B[cr]C[B57 looks small but big in reality, White comes under attack, White has no time to invade Black's territory on the left side.]
;W[dp];B[co];W[hl];B[dh]C[B61: Black first strengthens itself, not giving White any chance to fight desperately.];W[km];B[om]C[B63 is a steady move with favorable consciousness.];W[io];B[jo];W[jn];B[or];W[pr];B[ok]LB[el:a]C[B69 is better then reinforcing at 'a'.]
;W[dl];B[be]C[B71 is good move, White in the upper-left corner appears thin instantly.];W[ce];B[bf];W[gb]C[W74: White reinforces himself and also aims at Black's thinness at the top.];B[cm]C[B75 is a mutual good point.];W[kc];B[kb]C[B77 is good move, White has no severe follow-up tactic.];W[qk];B[rh];W[ri]
;B[sg];W[qi];B[fl];W[ek]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.];B[el];W[ei]LB[dk:a][fj:b]C[W86 is tesuji for dodging, if White connects at 'a', Black will cap at 'b', White is dangerous.];B[di];W[dk];B[hk];W[ej]
;B[il];W[im];B[fg];W[gi];B[gl];W[hm];B[bc]C[Following B97, Black aims to strengthen the top side by sacrificing.];W[ad];B[cc];W[cd];B[eb];W[dc];B[db]
