;W[er];B[bm];W[bn];B[fq];W[bp];B[bl];W[dl];B[ap];W[ao];B[fr];W[bk];B[cs]C[The sequence up to 31 is a recently popular joseki.];W[oq]LB[nq:a]C[W32: White can also consider to approach the corner with the large knight's move at 'a'.]
;B[mp]C[B33 is tight.];W[mq]LB[oo:a][no:b]C[W34 jumping to 'a' or making the knight's move at 'b' is also possible.];B[lq];W[lp];B[nq];W[mr];B[mo];W[nr];B[kp];W[po]
;B[qo];W[pn];B[qn];W[pm];B[lo];W[qr];B[ql]C[For the result up to 49, from the whole board's configuration, Black can be satisfied.];W[fc]LB[jd:a][ec:b]C[W50 extending to 'a' or making the diagonal move at 'b' is also playable.];B[bd]C[B51: Black starts the reduction right away, carrying out his strategy: go all out to grab territory.];W[cd]
;B[be];W[bc];B[cg];W[ci];B[eg];W[df];B[ch]C[The exchange of W58 for B59 is not necessarily favorable for White.];W[nc];B[lc];W[ne];B[pb]C[B63 is a good move according to circumstances.];W[kd]
;B[kc];W[jd];B[jc];W[id];B[hc];W[hd];B[gc];W[gd];B[fb];W[ic];B[ib];W[eb];B[bb]C[B77 is very timely.]

;W[ok];B[qk];W[pg];B[pf];W[of];B[mc]LB[mb:a]C[B95: It is a thick play, Black reinforces himself to defend against White's hane at 'a' giving White no chance for fighting desperately.];W[qg];B[og]C[B97 is strong and brutal.];W[pi];B[ng];W[md]

;W[np];B[no];W[rf];B[re];W[nm];B[nq];W[or];B[rg]C[B121 seems small but big in reality, leaving White some scruples for the right side.];W[rh];B[sf]C[After 123, Black is clearly ahead in territory,  in order to win, White must wage an effective attack on Black in the left side and the center.];W[jl]C[W124 is worth study.];B[kg]C[The settling tactic following B125 is quite remarkable.]
;W[ji];B[ki];W[jh];B[ld]C[After this move, it is time for lunch break.];W[le];B[lf];W[ke];B[mf];W[me];B[kh];W[fo];B[gn]C[B137 is a good move.]
;W[jj]LB[af:a]C[B138: It seems White has miscalculated here, now White can only strike at 'a' and try to kill Black on the left side.];B[mk];W[ml]C[Through 140, White ends in gote, there is no doubt that White's situation has deteriorated.];B[fh];W[ei];B[de]C[B143: After Black has completely lived, Black's advantage becomes clear.];W[en];B[ep];W[io]C[W146: White makes the last-ditch effort.];B[km]
