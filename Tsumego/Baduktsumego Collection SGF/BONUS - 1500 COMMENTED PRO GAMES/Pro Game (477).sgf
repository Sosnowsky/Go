;W[qj];B[pk]C[The variation following B9 was once very popular, now people generally think that Black's thickness is not easier to control, less and less players use this.];W[qk];B[ql];W[rl];B[pj];W[qm];B[pl];W[qi];B[pm];W[qn];B[pn];W[rp]
;B[po];W[ro];B[fo];W[dk];B[rm];W[rn];B[fc]LB[gk:a]C[B27: In terms of enclosing a big moyo, Black should play at 'a', this kind of moyo is just of great momentum!];W[cf];B[jd];W[jm]C[W30: White first acts in the center, Black is not comfortable.];B[em]
;W[eq]LB[cm:a][dm:b]C[After W32, Black counterattacks at 'a', Lee Changho must be very uncomfortable! The common play of W32 is at 'b'.];B[cm];W[dn];B[dm];W[fr];B[gq];W[gr];B[hq];W[jk];B[di];W[fk]
;B[bn];W[bo];B[bl]C[B43 and B45 are tight! This is just White's weak point.];W[an]LB[bp:a]C[W46: White certainly should take tenuki, but after the clamp of B 'a', the ko is too heavy for White, White can't afford to lose.];B[hk];W[ji];B[hi]C[B47 and B49 are good tempo.];W[lj]C[Black forces White to play W48 and W50 and White can't see any points, Black is successful.];B[db];W[bi]
;B[cc]LB[ch:a]C[The direction of B51 and B53 is questionable, since White saves two stones with W52 and W54, it is big in points and also directly makes Black thin. Therefore, with B51 Black should capture two stones at 'a'.];W[cj];B[ej];W[ek];B[gl]C[In the real game, Black is forced to defend with the dame moves B55 and B57 and Black is painful.];W[lm]C[W58: White strengthens to make White itself thick, the game enters into Lee Changho's skillful situation.];B[bg]LB[be:a]C[B59: Black is over-zealous! Although now Black is difficult to play, Black has to be patient to wait for chances. The common play of B59 is at 'a'.];W[cg];B[bf]
;W[be];B[ce];W[cd];B[de];W[ee];B[df];W[bc];B[bh];W[eh]C[Lee Sedol miscalculated, W70 is a clever move! Lee Sedol must be very regretted after seeing this move, since the following sequence are all "orders"!];B[ef];W[ff];B[fe];W[eg]
;B[ed];W[dg];B[ee];W[ch];B[fg];W[fh];B[gg];W[gh];B[hh];W[hg];B[gf]C[Through B85, all black stones are dead and Black also ends in gote, White establishes superiority at one stroke.];W[jg];B[am]
;W[bm];B[rk];W[sm];B[bn]C[After this move, it is time for lunch break.

White is still pondering.];W[bp]LB[ao:a][co:b]C[W92 is a thick play, if White connects at 'a', Black's sente move at 'b' is very annoying.];B[er];W[dr];B[kl];W[jl];B[lo]
;W[pc]C[The selection point of W98 is appropriate, Black feels difficult on both sides. If Black couldn't enclose a big territory at the top, Black's territory is inadequate.];B[oc];W[ob];B[od];W[pb];B[nb];W[qd];B[qe];W[rd];B[lg];W[lh];B[rb]C[B109: Black starts to fight desperately, only playing like this, Black may still have a chance.]
;W[re];B[qc];W[qb];B[rc];W[ra];B[sb];W[mb];B[nc];W[na];B[mh];W[kh];B[rf]C[B121 is an intense unusual tactic!];W[qf]
;B[sd];W[pe];B[se];W[qe];B[mc];W[rg]LB[lb:a][qg:b]C[W128: If White plays at 'a', then Black can play at 'b', White is dangerous.
];B[oa]C[After B129, locally it becomes ko-killing, Lee Sedol's fight ability is really strong.];W[dc]C[W130: But White starts to play endgame, in terms of the whole game, White is still favorable, Lee Sedol also has no way out.];B[ig]C[B131 is necessary, since there is a ko fight in the upper-right corner, Black must make himself thicker.]
;W[mi];B[qr];W[pa];B[lb];W[eb]C[The value of B133 and W136 is about same, this is the reason why White grabs the endgame of W130.];B[fb];W[cb];B[ci];W[bj];B[gi];W[af];B[km]C[B143: Black again starts to fight desperately, but White's eye space is too rich in the middle, Black comes to nothing in the end.]
;W[kn];B[ll];W[ln];B[ml];W[in];B[jo];W[jn];B[qh];W[pi]C[W152: As to the provoke of B151, White has no reason to retreat.];B[rh];W[ph];B[qg];W[sf]
;B[pg];W[sc];B[sd];W[nh];B[of];W[se]C[After settling the center, White takes chance to initiate the ko with W162, Black is clearly not favorable in ko threats and also already shows a losing sign.];B[mg];W[sc];B[oi]C[B163 and B165: Black seeks a way of conceding defeat.];W[oh];B[ni];W[oj]
;B[nj];W[nk];B[ok];W[mj];B[oj];W[ko];B[lp];W[nl];B[nm];W[sa]C[After White eliminates the ko with W178, at any rate White in the center couldn't die.];B[ij];W[mm];B[mk]
;W[jj];B[kk];W[kj];B[ol];W[hm];B[ep];W[es];B[il];W[kp]C[Lee Changho 9p won the right to challenge Choi Cheolhan 9p in best-of-5 final. The final game 1 will take place on 1/25.])
