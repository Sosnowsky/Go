Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[As in the last game, I made some mistakes when I was favorable early on and the situation became complicated, luckily at the end I still won the game.];W[dd];B[fc]C[B3: Black elects not to take empty corners, it seems Seo Bongsoo wants to take initiative.];W[hc];B[dq]

;B[jq];W[ph];B[dc]LB[le:a][kd:b]C[B21: I feel, for Black to first make knight at 'a' is better, after W 'b', then B21.];W[cc];B[cb];W[ec];B[db];W[ed];B[cd];W[bc];B[bd]
;W[bb];B[ba];W[eb];B[ac];W[md]C[In the game, White gets to attach up with W34, White's shape is very good.];B[dj];W[qf]C[W36 makes Black painful.];B[pc]LB[pf:a]C[B37: Black should press at 'a' to probe White.];W[od];B[oe];W[ob]
;B[me];W[le];B[lf];W[ke]C[Black's play is within my expectation.];B[mg];W[kf]C[White takes chance and forms a big territory at top, however Black's big group is still not alive, White is easier to play.];B[kg];W[nf]C[The strike of W48 makes Black very uncomfortable.];B[og];W[ne]C[With W48, Black's big group has no eye space, it is always Teacher Seo's burden.];B[pg]
;W[qg];B[pj]LB[ng:a]C[The play of B53 is typical "wild grass" style! I think Black will connect at 'a', the invasion of B53 is really to my surprise and kind of game-deciding play.];W[pi];B[qk];W[ni];B[ng];W[qm];B[nj];W[mj];B[oj];W[nh];B[mk]
;W[lh];B[lg];W[lj];B[lk];W[kj];B[ig];W[rn]C[After the hane of W70, the aji is very bad in Black's corner, not sure how Black to respond.];B[kk];W[jj];B[jk]C[B71 and B73 are "against tide", regardless of life-being of Black's big group in the upper right, Black goes all out to enclose the big moyo in the lower left corner.];W[ij];B[jf]
;W[ik];B[il];W[hl];B[hm]C[The double-hane of B77 and B79 is also a little far-fetched.];W[im];B[jl];W[gl];B[gm];W[nl];B[nk];W[fm]C[W86: I thought out this move in the lunch time.];B[in]
;W[fn];B[mq]LB[mp:a]TR[im]C[But next I made a big mistake, W 'a'. The purpose of B89 is to prevent W80 (the marked stone) from escaping. I thought, after W 'a', White can escape W80. But Black takes tenuki unexpectedly! I suddenly realized, W80 still can't escape (you can try it out)! I almost wasted one move!];W[mp]LB[fj:a][fl:b][kp:c][rc:d]C[W90: There are three plays now that are all much better than W90; One, to strengthen at 'a' and guard against Black's cut at 'b'; Two, to strike at 'c' and continue playing ladder breaker, Black is not easy to respond; Three, to strike at 'd', threatening Black's big group, White can decide what to do based on how Black to respond.];B[fl]C[After the cut of B91, the situation becomes complicated.];W[gj]C[Although I'm still having initiative, ...]
;B[hi]C[..., but this kind of chaotic fight is not my original plan.];W[gi]LB[rc:a]C[Luckily I can come back and strike at 'a' at any time, White takes advantage by attacking Black's big group.];B[hh];W[hj];B[el];W[dn];B[cl];W[cn];B[bn]LB[bo:a][rc:b]C[B101 is the losing move! If Black descends at 'a', the situation is not clear. I may take tenuki and strike at 'b' instead.]
;W[eq]C[W102 is good move, after this move, I feel confident I can win it.];B[dp]LB[ep:a][do:b]C[Black can't play hane at 'a', otherwise after W 'b', Black can't tolerate.];W[ep]C[After W104, this white group already can make life.];B[gq];W[gp];B[hq];W[io];B[ho]C[B109 again is miscalculation.];W[hp]LB[ip:a][hn:b]C[After White pushes with W110, Black already can't cut at 'a', otherwise White will throw in at 'b', Black will collapse.]
