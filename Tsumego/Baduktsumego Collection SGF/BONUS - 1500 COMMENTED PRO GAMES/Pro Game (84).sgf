(;SZ[19]EV[6th LG Cup final game 4]DT[2002-03-29]KM[6.5]BR[9p]WR[9p]PW[Cho Hunhyun]PB[Yoo Changhyeok]PC[Seoul, Korea]RE[B+R]C[Copyright by gogameworld.com and weiqi.tom.com.];B[pd]C[In the first three games, Yoo Changhyeok trails best-of-5 by 1:2, the situation is severe.];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd]C[So far, in the past six terms of LG Cup, Yoo Changhyeok advanced to the final for four times, in the first three finals, he was not lucky and failed to win one champion.];B[qk]
;W[mp]LB[lp:a]C[W6 is a common play to counter the "Low Chinese Opening", recently a play at 'a' is also quite often seen.];B[kp]C[The champ of B7 is a relatively intense play.];W[pp]LB[oo:a]C[W8: White can also consider to make the knight's move at 'a'.];B[qp]LB[op:a][qq:b]C[If B9 at 'a', then W 'b'.];W[qo];B[qq];W[po]
;B[nq]LB[op:a][oo:b][np:c][no:d][mo:e]C[B13 is a steady move, in the past, the fighting variation with B 'a', W 'b', B 'c', W 'd' and B 'e' was also seen.];W[mn]LB[np:a]C[W14 is better then pressing at 'a'.];B[np];W[no];B[lo];W[mo];B[lr]
;W[qi]C[With the invasion of W20, Black is also under attack.];B[ok];W[mk]C[Both sides seem to have a well-thought-out plan, the stones are flying to the board, so far the overall time for the game is less than 15 minutes.];B[qg]LB[nj:a][qf:b]C[B23: Black seeks a tempo of playing, if Black makes the diagonal extension at 'a', then W 'b', Black can't be satisfied.];W[pg]LB[qf:a][pj:b][pk:c][ni:d]C[W24 is relentless, if Black retreats at 'a', then White would have some ferocious moves such as W 'b', B 'c' and W 'd'. Cho Hunhyun's recent nickname is "Fighting God", as for the last several games and the current game, we can see the true meaning of this nickname!];B[qh]C[B25 is an intense counterattack, the fight around this area is quite important.]
;W[pi];B[nj];W[ph];B[qe]LB[qf:a]C[B29 is better than retreat at 'a', the position of B29 is more advantageous to protecting the upper-right corner.];W[mj];B[ni];W[pf];B[nd]LB[qf:a][rf:b][re:c][rd:d][rg:e][mh:f]C[B33 is a good move. After B33, White has the tactic of W 'a', B 'b', W 'c', B 'd' and W 'e', when White cuts at 'c', if Black doesn't play atari at 'd' but connect at 'e' instead, then the aji in the corner is very bad. Of course, White needs to consider its timing. Cho Hunhyun is pondering here, not sure whether he is considering the fierce move at 'f', this way it would lead to a very complicated fight.]
;W[mg]LB[mh:a]C[In contrast, W34 is mild, perhaps Cho 9p feels that enclosing White at 'a' is too risky.];B[mi]C[B35: Black gets to stick his head out, Black's situation is not bad.];W[pl];B[pk];W[qf];B[rf];W[re]LB[ri:a]C[W40 guards against Black's sente hane and connection at 'a'.];B[rd];W[oe]LB[li:a]C[The sequence from W38 to W42 is an intense maneuver, White is eyeing for the hane at 'a'.]
;B[md]LB[ki:a][od:b][oc:c][nc:d]C[B43: If Black jumps to 'a', then W 'b', B 'c' and W 'd', this way White is not bad.];W[od];B[oc];W[pc];B[qc];W[rg]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.];B[ll]C[The play of B49 is to all people's surprise, but in the study room most players think: because of Cho Hunhyun's consecutive strong moves in the upper right corner, Yoo Changhyeok's Black is not easy to play.];W[ml]
;B[li];W[sf]C[The value of W52 itself is huge, but it also takes a big risk.];B[lm]
(;W[mr]LB[kj:a][mm:b][nl:c][nm:d][ol:e][lj:f][lk:g][kk:h]C[W52: For White to jump to 'a' to separate Black is not good, followed by B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f', W 'g' and B 'h' (see var a).];B[mq];W[lp];B[jp]LB[lq:a][kr:b][ln:c][kn:d][ko:e][jn:f]C[B57 is a beautiful strong move, next if W 'a', B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e' and B 'f', White can't run out (see var a). Cho Hunhyun is in a deep meditation now, it seems Cho Hunhyun has neglected B57.]

(;W[mm];B[kj];W[nk];B[oj]LB[pb:a][ob:b][qb:c][rb:d][pe:e][qd:f][rc:g][sc:h][sd:i]C[There is still some aji left in the upper right corner, for example, W 'a', B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f', W 'g', B 'h' and W 'i', it would lead to a ko.]
(;W[ln];B[kn];W[km]C[The purpose of W64 is to make some trouble for Black before making life, but it seems a little far-fetched, now the original move is to strengthen and make life.];B[jm]LB[kl:a][jn:b][kk:c]C[B65 is the right move, if playing atari at 'a', then W65, B 'b' and W 'c', Black is difficult to answer.];W[kl];B[lk];W[jl];B[ol]LB[lj:a][kk:b][ki:c][jj:d]C[B69 is relentless, if W 'a', then B 'b', W 'c' and B 'd', White would be dangerous in the capturing race.]
;W[lq];B[kr];W[ql]C[W72 making life first is the original move.];B[rn]C[B73 is the vital point for attack, White sinks into a difficult situation. Cho Hunhyun is again in a deep meditation, now Cho Hunhyun only has 10 minutes free time left, but Yoo Changhyeok still gets 1 hour and 13 minutes free time left.];W[oq];B[nr]LB[ro:a][op:b][or:c]C[B75 is a good move, because Black can play at 'a', so 'b' and 'c' are all not absolutely sente.];W[rm];B[pm]C[B77 is tight, White is very hard to answer.]

(;W[qn]LB[qm:a][on:b][or:c][ro:d]C[W78 is miscalculation, White should play at 'a', followed by B 'b', W 'c', B 'd' and W78, this way the variation would be relatively complex (see var a).];B[qm];W[ro]LB[rl:a][on:b][oo:c]C[W80: White already can't answer at 'a', otherwise B 'b', W 'c' and B80, White is no good.];B[rl];W[sn];B[sl]TR[qn]C[After the stand of B83, White already can't make life locally. The marked white stone is obviously Cho Hunhyun's mistake under time pressure.]

;B[fk]C[B103: Black is not soft-hearted.];W[gl];B[fj]LB[ko:a]C[After Black strengthens himself with B105, White immediately becomes weak, Black's defect at 'a' is also indirectly being strengthened. Cho Hunhyun concedes defeat. The series ties at two a piece, the decisive game 5 will take place on 4/1.])
