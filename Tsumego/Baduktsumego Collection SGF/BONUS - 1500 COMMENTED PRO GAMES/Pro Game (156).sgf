Chang Hao who was in a low condition recently took Black and defeated the current #1 ranking player Gu Li 7p, getting one precious point and helping Shanghai Team to tie Chuongqing Team.];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[fq];W[hq]
;B[cf]C[The opening from B1 to B7 is a very common shape in the games between Chang Hao and Gu Li, in my memory Chang Hao almost won all those games.];W[fc];B[cn];W[fp];B[cq];W[dq];B[cp];W[do];B[co]LB[cr:a][dr:b][qo:c][cl:d][cm:e][dl:f][cs:g]C[The simple connection of B15 is calm. Originally Black should descend at 'a', then White will block at 'b', this way Black can tenuki and grab the empty corner at 'c'. However, although Black obtains sente, but White can come back and force at 'd', Black will be difficult. If Black hits at 'e', White extends at 'f', next when White plays the hane at 'g', Black would have no answer.]
;W[qo];B[qk];W[nq];B[op];W[np];B[pn];W[nn]LB[qr:a][qq:b][pr:c][rr:d][oq:e][po:f]C[W22: White can directly strike at 'a'. This way Black can only cap at 'b', then W 'c', B 'd', W 'e' and B 'f'. Now if White still jumps to 22, White will end in gote, so Gu Li first jumps to 22, watching how Black to act.]
;B[qn]LB[oo:a][no:b]C[B23: Black should first extend at 'a', after White connects at 'b', then Black plays at 23 to capture White completely.];W[cr];B[br];W[pr]C[In the game, Black simply blocks with B23, after White attaches alertly with W26, Black is very difficult to handle.];B[or]LB[qr:a]C[The counterattack of B27 is inevitable. If Black plays the inner hane at 'a', White will retreat at 27, Black still has cut points.];W[oo]LB[oq:a][qr:b][qp:c]C[W28 is a good sequence, if White first cuts at 'a', then B 'b', if White ataris now at 28, Black will hang over at 'c'.]
;B[nr];W[oq];B[qq];W[qp];B[qr];W[lq]LB[mr:a][mq:b][lr:c][pp:d][ps:e][qs:f][rq:g][rr:h][sr:i]C[W34 is conservative. White should hane at 'a', then B 'b' and W 'c'. Because White's taking at 'd' is absolutely sente (otherwise W 'e', B 'f', W 'g', B 'h' and W 'i', Black's corner will die.), White is not afraid of a direct confrontation.]
;B[mr];W[qf];B[qh];W[nd];B[pf];W[pg];B[qg];W[pc];B[qe];W[qc];B[mq];W[mp];B[lp]C[The push and cut of B45 and B47 is severe.]

(;W[rf]LB[kq:a][kp:b][jq:c][jp:d][ip:e][ln:f][nl:g][ll:h]C[W48: White wants to draw back at 'a' to fight with Black, but this way Black can simply press at 'b', then W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f', W 'g' and B 'h', White's thickness on the right side will be wasted (see var a).];B[re];W[of];B[pe];W[pk];B[qj]

(;B[ic]LB[cd:a][fr:b][dr:c][cc:d][de:e][gp:f]C[B57 and B59 are out of favorable consciousness, so Black allows White to safely protect the corner at 'a'. After the game, Chang Hao thinks Black should descend at 'b' positively, next W 'c', B 'a', W 'd' and B 'e', attacking White by using the big ko threat at 'f' (see var a).];W[cd];B[lo]LB[mo:a]C[B61 is no good, reducing Black's own liberties and also losing the tactic of destroying White's eye shape with the atari at 'a'.];W[mo];B[ck];W[eh]

;B[hb];W[he]LB[ge:a]C[W92: For White to play at 'a' is the original shape, but from the state of mind, White always wants to play at 92.];B[gh];W[dj];B[cj];W[ci];B[dk];W[ej];B[gf]
(;W[ef]LB[hf:a][hg:b][fg:c][gg:d][ge:e][ff:f][hd:g]TR[cf]C[W100 is no good, to attach at 'a' is the original shape. If Black hangs at 'b', then W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f' and W100, White can look after both the upper and lower side (see var a). Moreover when White attaches at 'a', if B 'e', then W 'g', Black still can't save the marked black stone.];B[hf];W[ge];B[ie];W[if];B[fe]
;W[ff]LB[gd:a]C[W106 is an impulsive move. Black presses in the center consecutively, turnig all white stones into endgame plays. White should tolerate by playing at 'a', this is only several points difference from the real game.];B[ig];W[jf];B[jg];W[kf];B[kg];W[lf];B[lg];W[mf];B[ec];W[dc];B[ea]
;W[db];B[na]LB[nh:a]C[B119 is greedy, only if Black firmly protects at around 'a', Black is definitely favorable.];W[ii]C[W120 is the vital point, Black instead becomes defendant inside his own influence.];B[hi];W[hj];B[gj];W[hh];B[gi];W[hg];B[gg];W[ih]
;B[ij];W[ji];B[fl];W[dm];B[cm];W[jj]C[Through B134, Black is already not good.];B[hk];W[il];B[gn];W[hl]LB[hn:a]C[W138 is no good, to attach at 'a' is the shape.];B[hn]
;W[go];B[gl];W[in]LB[fn:a]C[W142 is no good! Black gets to destroy eye shape with the sequence following B 'a', for White to make life at 'a' is the right move.];B[fn];W[io];B[eo];W[fo];B[en];W[ep];B[mi];W[dn];B[ek]
