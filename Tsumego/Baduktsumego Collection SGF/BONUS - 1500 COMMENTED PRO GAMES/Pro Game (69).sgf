;W[nc];B[pf];W[jd];B[jp];W[hq]C[The position up to 10 is a standard variation of "Senrensei Fuseki".];B[cj]C[B11: Black elects to play the splitting move on the left side, it is a variation. Takemiya likes to call his play "Natural Style" and not only just simple "Cosmic Style". B11 is the exact annotation of the word "Natural".];W[ch];B[cn];W[cl]C[W14: White invades to probe Black, it is a usual play of the Modern Go.];B[en];W[fp];B[dk]C[B15 and B17: Black has played steadily.]
;W[bp]C[W18: White has obtained the corner with sente and some profits in territory.];B[dl]C[B19: Black defends against White's push and cut over here, it is necessary. Comparing with the light and nimble style of Cho Hunhyun, Takemiya's style is just the opposite, he likes thickness and prefers outside influence.];W[dc]C[W20: White continues to adopt his territory-oriented strategy.];B[lc]C[B21: Because Black already has one group on the left side,  it is not a pure situation where Black wants to make a big moyo,  so Black invades into the enemy's territory.];W[le];B[md];W[qc]C[W22 and W24: Cho Hunhyun first plays on the outside then on the inside, his play is very flexible.];B[pc];W[rd]C[W26 is a good move to foil the opponent's plan.];B[qb]LB[pb:a]C[B27: Black prevents White from living in the corner with sente by the hane move at 'a', at this juncture it is the right choice.]
;W[rb];B[qd];W[rc];B[pb];W[rf];B[rg]C[B33: Black can block White from the outside in sente, the local fight is productive for Black.];W[ra];B[hd]C[The invasion of B35 over here is a powerful move. The middle game fight thus commences.];W[kc]C[W36: For White to cut Black's route of retreat is very important.];B[hf];W[lb];B[mb]C[The hane of B39 is a good move.]
;W[jf]C[W40: For White to first move towards the center is the right choice.];B[ld];W[ih];B[gg];W[kh]C[White forms a good shape in the center with W42 and W44, and basically has obtained a steady foothold.];B[ic]C[B45 seems very fierce, however it is a very questionable move. Although he leaves a possibility of crossing over on the upper side, but Black has also lost the good chance of taking the initiative by attacking White.];W[df]C[W46: White first secures the upper left corner and then starts to handle the weak stones in the center, this exactly fits Cho Hunhyun's style and plan.];B[oq];W[qo];B[qp];W[rp]

;W[mm]C[Generally speaking, the sequence from W60 and W64 seems a vulgar play, but in the current situation, it is a good play to settle oneself on the spot.];B[ll];W[pn]LB[rl:a]C[W66 is significant, otherwise if being haned on the second line by Black at 'a', White's eye shape will disappear completely. After W66, the fight on the right side comes to an end. Next, how Black attacks White at the top by utilizing his center thickness will be the key for the game.];B[me]C[B67: Black first defends against White's pressing over here, it is a steady way for attack.];W[gh];B[fh];W[gi];B[eg];W[jk]C[W72: White jumps to the center and at the same time takes into account his big group's eye space.];B[kj]
;W[jj];B[no]C[B75: Black aims to first attack White on the right side, based on the resulting situation, then decide how to attack the center white group.];W[mo];B[ln]C[B77: Black seeks to first destroy White's eye shapes and then come back to answer at the bottom.
];W[lm];B[kl];W[np]C[The hane of W80 is a brilliant counterattack.];B[mn]LB[oo:a]C[B81: Black is certainly not willing to connect at 'a' docilely, however by playing like this, Black will lose the chance to attack the center white group.];W[oo];B[nn]
;W[on];B[op];W[km];B[jl];W[il]C[W88 is a good move to take care of the center big group.];B[ko];W[jm];B[iq];W[hr];B[mh]C[B93 is the losing move for this game, Black has reinforced himself but it is not adequate, Black has neglected the weakness of the center stone's shortage of liberties.];W[qf];B[qg]
;W[rk]C[The hane of W96 is already secretly full of murderous intentions.];B[rj];W[oj]C[After the pressing move of W98, Black has sank into a terrible situation.];B[oi];W[pi];B[qj];W[ni];B[li]C[B103 is the only possible move for further resistance.];W[oh];B[qi];W[nq];B[ro]C[B107: Having seen the inadequacy of territory on the board, Black goes all out to grab the big endgame plays even though he is aware that his territory at the bottom is defective.]
;W[ng];B[mg];W[mf]C[W108 and W100 are in good order, there is an opportunity to take advantage of in the center.];B[nf];W[kk]C[W112: White sees that he is favorable, even though he doesn't exploit the aji in the center, he can still win, so he treats this move lightly.];B[lk];W[ki];B[mi];W[mj];B[lj];W[lf];B[og]
;W[nh];B[ph];W[kq]C[W122 is the vital point for the capturing race on the lower side. Cho Hunhyun now sees it clear that there is something to profit from, so he has already prepared to sacrifice his several stones in the center.];B[in];W[im];B[mr]C[B123 and B125: Black has to seek a compromise over here.];W[ne];B[of];W[lp];B[nr];W[ir]C[W128 and W130: White is reluctant to take more risks.];B[lq]
;W[kp];B[mp];W[kb]C[Being able to connect with W134, White already has full assurance of success.];B[mc];W[bn];B[bm];W[co];B[an];W[bo];B[cm];W[nb]C[W142 is an asking move, its timing is very ingenious.];B[nd]LB[ma:a]C[B143: Locally, Black can stand at 'a' and kill White. But, if White creates a lot of ko threats over here, Black is hard to win the big ko fight in the center, so Black has to give way.]
;W[gc];B[gd];W[fc];B[dh];W[cg];B[nk]C[B149: Black must reinforce, otherwise he can not play somewhere else at ease.];W[ma]C[W150 is a big move itself, and White also quietly aims to cut Black on the left. Over here, Cho Hunhyun's swift and fierce style is evident.];B[kr];W[jq];B[fj];W[lg];B[nj]
;W[kd];B[od];W[bi];B[gj];W[rn];B[sp];W[ff];B[fg];W[gf]LB[he:a]C[After W164, the reason for Black's resignation is that, White can wedge and cut at 'a', Black is unable to save his stones at the top.

Cho Hunhyun is skilled in light and nimble plays, so he is just the subduer of Takemiya who is good at big moyo fights. In the past confrontations between them, if Takemiya took Black, he lost more games than he won. It is interesting that, if Takemiya takes White, he has a much higher winning percentage.])
