Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[Kisei is the biggest Go tournament in Japan. Although Hane Naoki lost 14 consecutive games in international tournaments, but his overall performance in Japan is still very good. In this decisive game 7, he easily defeated his opponent and defended his title successfully by 4:3.];W[pq];B[cd];W[cp];B[po]
;W[oc];B[kc];W[ph];B[pf]C[After this move, it is time for lunch break.];W[qc]C[The opening of W8 and W10 is a trend and rarely seen.];B[rc];W[pd];B[qb];W[qe];B[pc];W[rd];B[qc]
;W[pe];B[od];W[oe]LB[ne:a]C[After White plays atari with W20, White should continue to press at 'a'. Here is clearly a must-obtain place, not clear why Yuki Satoshi ignores it!];B[nd];W[pm]C[The high pincer of W22 is a little careless, after Black attaches and cuts in the game, White clearly doesn't have any good follow-up. With W22 for White to play one-space low pincer is relatively better.];B[no];W[nq];B[qq];W[qr];B[qp];W[or]
;B[qm];W[ql];B[pl];W[rm];B[qn];W[qk];B[ol]C[After this move, the game was closed for the first day.];W[fc];B[pj];W[qj];B[ne];W[of];B[nf]
;W[og];B[dc];W[ic];B[eq];W[ci]LB[do:a]C[W46 again is a weird thinking, White should make the normal diagonal at 'a', taking the whole game into account.];B[do]C[With the sequence following B47, Black is very happy to press in sente.];W[co];B[dn];W[cm];B[cn];W[bn]
;B[bm];W[bl];B[dm];W[cl];B[bo];W[am];B[cq];W[bp];B[jp]C[In the end, Black grabs the excellent point with B61, Black is already favorable in the game.];W[dp];B[ep];W[fo]C[After striking with W64, White invades, it is a desperate play in an inferior situation.]
;B[eo]C[After this move, it is time for lunch break.];W[hp];B[in]LB[hn:a]C[B67: Black can consider to cap at 'a'. Of course, the play in the game is also very simple and clear.];W[fm];B[gn];W[fn];B[gq];W[cf];B[df];W[dg];B[ef]
;W[ce];B[de];W[ed];B[dd];W[eb];B[db];W[da]LB[jb:a][ie:b]C[W82 is indeed hard to understand, here is really too small. White should make the diagonal at 'a' then jump to 'b' as he does later in the game, this way although White's situation is not good, but the game is still early.];B[dh];W[ch];B[eg]C[Black is very happy with B83 and B85, here Black already takes control of the game.]
;W[jb];B[kb];W[ie];B[cg];W[bg];B[gd]LB[di:a]C[B91 is not good, Black should press at 'a' instead, this way perhaps Black would concede defeat right away.];W[fk];B[gm];W[ej]LB[gl:a]C[W94 equals to losing fighting spirit, now if White is still conscious of winning, White should hang at 'a' to initiate a fight. Perhaps now Yuki Satoshi still doesn't realize how severe his situation is.];B[fl]
;W[el];B[gl];W[em];B[gk];W[gb];B[fj];W[ek];B[mr]C[Black's sequence following B103 to enclose territory is crude but effective.];W[mq];B[lr];W[mo];B[lp];W[mp]
;B[gp];W[rn];B[mm];W[ro];B[rr];W[rs];B[pp];W[lo];B[kp];W[rq];B[bq]C[In the end, Black blocks with B119, Black's victory already can be changed!];W[bd];B[bc]
;W[re];B[aq];W[ao];B[hf]C[Although Black's sequence following B125 to enclose territory is not so good, but due to huge advantage, finally Black still wins the game by 4.5 points!];W[if]C[In this game, Yuki Satoshi doesn't give play to his talent.];B[ig];W[he];B[ge];W[jg];B[hg];W[kf];B[jc]
