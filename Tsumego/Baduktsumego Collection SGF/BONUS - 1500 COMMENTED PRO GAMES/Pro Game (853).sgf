Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[pd]C[Rin Kaiho 9p and Takemiya Masaki 9p rarely play each other nowadays, now it is very hard to see the games between them.];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[fq]
;W[hq];B[qk];W[lp];B[cn];W[fp];B[gp];W[gq];B[cp];W[cq]LB[eq:a]C[Right from the beginning, they unexpectedly release a new "joseki". The hane of W14 is strong and unyielding, to capture at 'a' is common but it is clearly unacceptable to Takemiya 9p who doesn't conform to conventional pattern.];B[ep];W[fo];B[do]C[The play of B17 brings us into much higher realm of Go.]
;W[dq];B[eo];W[eq];B[fn];W[fr]C[Through W22, it becomes a complete new variation, the gain and loss is not clear. Two ancestors's inventing spirit is worth admiring.];B[cf];W[di];B[ef];W[fd];B[fi]C[The play of B25 and B27 is of great momentum!];W[dk];B[gf]
;W[hd]LB[fk:a][ic:b]C[W30 leads White into a bitter battle, for White to jump out at 'a' is just appropriate; Even if White wants to protect territory, White should make extension at 'b'.];B[fk]C[B31: Black is very happy to seal off by the jump of B31!];W[dm];B[go];W[fq];B[en];W[dg];B[df];W[fh];B[cj]
;W[dj];B[eh]LB[ei:a]C[As to White's counterattack of W38, the play of B39 and B41 is in good order, White completely has no state of mind to cut in at 'a'.];W[cm];B[jc]C[Black forces with B43 and it is just right, now we can easily see the improperness of W30's position.];W[ie];B[ec];W[ed];B[cc];W[cd]LB[dc:a][kd:b]C[W48: White should push calmly at 'a', next B48 and W 'b', this way although White incurs loss locally, but the game is still early.]
;B[dc];W[bd];B[gc];W[gd];B[hb]C[Black's sequence from B45 to B53 is very sharp! Black takes away territory and White's base, instantly White's long stick becomes a burden.];W[cg];B[bf];W[eg]C[Intolerable White elects to fight desperately with W56, but it more seems to fight a war in which you know you must lose.];B[fg];W[gh];B[ei];W[gi]
;B[gj];W[hj];B[if];W[jf];B[ig];W[ii];B[he];W[jg]LB[jd:a]C[The original move of W68 is to strengthen the cut at 'a', but after Black turns out at 68, White can't look after both the upper and lower side. In the real game, White has no other choice but to play tenaciously!];B[je];W[id];B[jh];W[ih]
;B[kh];W[kf];B[jd];W[ff];B[fe];W[gg];B[ff];W[lg];B[jj];W[hl];B[ci]C[B83 is a clever move, after making one eye, White's big dragon dies unconditionally.];W[dh];B[bg]
;W[gk]C[Although White captures several black stones with W86, but the gain and loss is not proportional.];B[mi];W[of];B[bq];W[bo];B[bn];W[bp];B[ko]LB[oh:a]C[B93: For Black to attack White at around 'a' is more steady.];W[bk];B[mf];W[mg]
;B[md];W[od];B[oc];W[nf];B[ai];W[pp]C[W102 is a brilliant move! After settling the shape, Black in the middle becomes thin.];B[op];W[oo];B[oq];W[no];B[co];W[br];B[im]

;B[nj];W[pi];B[kj];W[pk]C[White takes chance to capture B7 with W124 and W126, White's profit is huge.];B[nh];W[pg];B[io];W[me];B[nl];W[pl];B[mn]C[But Black's advantage is too big, after Black captures two stones with B133, Black still can ensure the victory.];W[rp]
