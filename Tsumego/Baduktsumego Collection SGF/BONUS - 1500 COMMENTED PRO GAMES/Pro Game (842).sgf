Translation:GoGameWorld.];B[qd]C[In the 28th Japanese Meijin title match 1, the challenger Yamashita Keigo clearly didn't give full play to his talent and incurred a complete defeat. In the game 2, we all thought Yamashita Keigo will rally his forces and let us enjoy his beautiful and unique Yamashita's style. However unexpectedly, in this game, Yamashita Keigo who takes Black seems falling sleep, his moves are very soft and have no any resistance, as a result, Yoda achieved two consecutive victory easily. So Yamashita is fraught with grim possibilities.];W[dp];B[dc];W[ce];B[pp]
;W[od];B[dh];W[qc];B[kc]C[The opening up to B9 is one that Korean players relatively more like to play.];W[rd];B[qe];W[re];B[pc];W[qb]C[W14: White starts to vary, the normal play is to cut at the star point.];B[qf]LB[pd:a][pf:b][qg:c][oe:d]C[B15 is insufficient! Since White didn't cut, Black certainly should connect at 'a', followed by W15, B 'b', W 'c' and B 'd', Black is not bad.]
;W[oc]C[The clamp of W16 is a little better than the cut at the star point. After this fight, although Yamashita is still not bad in the game, but he is already losing momentum.];B[de]LB[cd:a]C[B17: The original shape is for Black to make the diagonal's hit at 'a'.];W[cd];B[cc];W[cg];B[dd];W[dg];B[eg];W[ef];B[df];W[eh]
;B[fg];W[di];B[cf];W[ch];B[bg];W[bh];B[gh]LB[jd:a]C[In the game, through B33, White is left with the superb shoulder-hit at 'a', Black can't be satisfied.];W[jd];B[jc];W[id];B[kd];W[jf]
;B[lf];W[jh];B[gj];W[bf]LB[jj:a]C[W42: White should not be hasty! Comparing to the lonely stones in the center, White on the side is much thicker, so White should jump to 'a'.];B[be];W[ag];B[hb]LB[oe:a]C[B45 is too slow! It is also too small and has little effect on Black. If Black worries that he is thin and wants to reinforce, Black should attach at 'a', this way even if White tenukis, Black can cultivate his moyo on the right side by attacking White.];W[hc];B[gb];W[gf]
;B[ff];W[nq];B[pn];W[kq]C[W50 and W52: White has grabbed the last big point and also contained Black's development, Black has lost the chance of attacking White.];B[oq];W[np];B[iq]C[B53 and B55: Black turns to fight at the bottom where White is stronger, it is the declaration of failure in this fight.];W[ql];B[om];W[rn];B[rp];W[pj]
;B[qh];W[ri];B[fq];W[qo];B[qp]C[After this move, the game was closed for the first day.];W[or];B[pr];W[op];B[rm];W[qm];B[qn];W[ro];B[po]
;W[rl];B[pq];W[eq];B[fp];W[dn]C[When W78, Black's territory is clearly not enough.];B[jj];W[hi];B[hh];W[ih];B[gi];W[lh];B[qj];W[qi]LB[rj:a]C[W86: White should give way by playing at 'a', not giving Black any chance for tangling.]

;W[if];B[mr]LB[ji:a]C[B127 is the losing move! Now Black can only destroy eyes at 'a', then strongly attack White at the bottom while White makes life his big dragon, this way Black may have a chance.];W[oe]C[W128: White tenukis and is alert! Here is just White's real hidden trouble! On the lower side, White's eye shape is rich and resilient, Black couldn't attack it.];B[ne];W[pg];B[jp];W[kp];B[nr];W[jm];B[jo];W[km]

;W[jr]C[After the diagonal's extension of W176, Black didn't achieve anything, Yamashita has suffered a big defeat.

The game 3 will take place on 10/1-10/2.])
