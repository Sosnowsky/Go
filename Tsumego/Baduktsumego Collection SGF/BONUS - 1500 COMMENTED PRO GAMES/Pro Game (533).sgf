;B[gc];W[ed];B[jd]C[Gu Li uses the opening with B7 and B9 very often recently.];W[oc];B[mc];W[qn];B[pk];W[nq];B[pn];W[qq];B[pq];W[qp];B[po]
;W[qo];B[qm];W[rm];B[ql];W[rl];B[rk];W[pr];B[or];W[qr]LB[pc:a][qg:b]C[The sequence from W12 to W28 is unique thinking, but this way White ends in gote, Black gets to first attack at 'a', White becomes too passive, White should consider to first counter-pincer at 'b' to break up Black's moyo.];B[pc];W[qj]
;B[sl]C[The order of B31 is important, if not playing now, later on Black may never get chance to play this move any more.];W[rn];B[qk];W[od]C[If W34 is omitted, after Black hangs, Black's shape is complete, it is huge, however in the real game, it is also very pitiful to give all side territory to Black.];B[pf];W[md];B[lc];W[of];B[og];W[pe];B[qe];W[pg]
;B[qf];W[ng];B[oh]C[Through B45, Black is successful in the opening.];W[mf];B[bc]C[Since Black's stones at the top including B7 and B9 already form a fortress, Black takes territory with B47, allowing White to take influence, it is correct thinking.];W[df];B[cf];W[dg];B[cg];W[dh];B[fq];W[dq]C[But W54 makes Black a little confusing, so with B47 Black should first consider to approach at 53, this way White at the top is not thick and White couldn't play at 54.]
;B[hp]LB[eo:a][fp:b]C[B55: Black wants to press with the knight's move at 'a', but White definitely will counterattack at 'b', since Black is not favorable for the ladder, Black is not good.];W[jq]C[B55 is normal, but the position of W56 is excellent, White can be satisfied.];B[jo];W[lq];B[eo];W[cn];B[oq];W[hr];B[hq]LB[em:a]C[B63: Black blocks crossover, not sure whether Gu Li sees some attacking tactics, in terms of value only, Black should jump at 'a'.]
;W[gr];B[fr];W[em]C[W66: White takes advantage in sente, it is very big.];B[gm];W[mi]C[When White grabs the good point with W68, White catches up, it becomes a close game.];B[ne]LB[oi:a]C[The sequence following B69 aims to guard against White's attachment at 'a'.];W[nd];B[nf];W[nh];B[oe];W[me]
;B[of];W[jf];B[ge];W[bb]C[W78 exploiting Black is very big, this is the vital point.];B[cc];W[cb];B[eb];W[db];B[bh];W[bi];B[ah];W[fb];B[fc]C[B87 is an impulsive move! And Black didn't make any accurate calculation.]
;W[gb]C[W88 is inevitable counterattack, Black's situation instantly starts to deteriorate.];B[ec];W[dd];B[cd];W[ic]LB[id:a][hc:b]C[W92: White is indeed very happy! If Black presses at 'a', then White can cross over at 'b', this way Black's territory turns into White's territory, Black is certainly not good.];B[kf]C[Perhaps Gu Li overlooks the good move of W92, Black spends a long time to play B93, but it is too late. B93 is Gu Li's first-class tactic to mess up the situation, but in the game he indeed succeeds, it can't be denied he is very lucky. In fact with B87 for Black to tolerate at 88 is also not bad.];W[id]C[W94: Of course White has no reason to retreat, this way Black's loss at the top will be very heavy, Black can't win the game if not capturing White in the center. The strange thing is, facing Gu Li's crazy chase-and-kill, White is surprisingly intimated, White's following moves contradict each other, not sure what he is doing.];B[je];W[ie]
;B[jg];W[if];B[lg];W[kh];B[kg];W[mg];B[lh];W[li];B[ii];W[jj];B[ig];W[ij]LB[ke:a]C[With W106 and W108, White should cut at 'a' to capture two stones in sente, can't see how Gu Li can win the game.

After this move, it is time for lunch break.]
;B[hj];W[hk];B[gg];W[hf]LB[ke:a]C[W112: In the game, after White incurs a big loss, White can no longer play at 'a'.];B[gf];W[hg];B[hh];W[ke];B[hb]C[B117 turning the body around is a alert! The game turns into a long one.];W[jc];B[gk]
;W[fi];B[fh];W[gi];B[gh];W[eh];B[ji];W[ki];B[hl];W[ob];B[ej];W[ei]LB[ek:a]C[W130 seems too heavy, to attach at 'a' is just tesuji, this way White can keep a little advantage in the game.];B[kd]
;W[le];B[cm]C[Since B33, it completely enters into Gu Li's show time.];W[dn];B[bl];W[fd];B[hc];W[kc];B[ib];W[dl];B[bn];W[bo];B[bp];W[co]
;B[ao];W[bk];B[ck];W[bj];B[cr];W[dr];B[cl];W[gj];B[cq];W[hi]C[However White becomes very confused, after W152 and W154, White at the bottom unexpectedly is being killed.];B[ef];W[de];B[fk]
;W[dk];B[dj];W[cj];B[al];W[jb];B[ld]C[Gu Li 7p advances to the final sixteen.])
