Copyright by gogameworld.com and weiqi.tom.com.];B[qd];W[dd]C[Go games are mostly decided by strength, but sometimes there is a little luck factor.];B[pp]C[Zhou Heyang and Park YuongHoon, these two players are about same strength, we can see from the game process. However, Zhou Heyang lacks a little luck in this game and Park YuongHoon achieves the final victory by his tenaciousness in chaotic situations.];W[dp];B[fc]
;W[cf];B[kc];W[qj];B[pi]C[Li He 1p thinks, the play of B9 is relatively more often seen from Korean players.];W[qi];B[ph];W[qh];B[qg];W[qm];B[rg];W[pj];B[mq]C[Through B17, both sides are acceptable. However professionals feel White's following sequence is not good.]

;B[oe];W[ie];B[hd]C[Through B33, Zhou Heyang is more like Dr. "donation". Black is left with crossover by W22. The upper right corner is now named "Park". W26 and W32 help opponent enclose territory, and White itself is still floating in the center and can't find any territory.];W[nh];B[og];W[oi]LB[mi:a]C[W36: Zhang Xuebin thinks, for White to play at 'a' is better.];B[oh];W[oj];B[ng];W[mh];B[mg]
;W[lh];B[lg];W[kh];B[kg];W[jh];B[jg];W[ig];B[ih];W[hg];B[ii]C[White plays a few stones in sente, but Black gets to cut with B49 and extends with B51, White is not thick as expected, in fact White is all very thin at top and in the center.];W[kk];B[gi];W[fg]
;B[ei];W[ec];B[fb];W[cm]C[Through W58, Piao Wenyao thinks, Black's territory is very big, White fails in the opening.];B[jk];W[jl];B[kj];W[lk];B[il];W[jm];B[cq]LB[jq:a]C[B65: Black is greedy for small territory. Zhang Xuebin and Piao Wenyao think, now Black should make extension at 'a', this way Black is leading in territory and also keeps balance for the game, Black is very easier to play. Park YuongHoon is a little hasty here.]
;W[dq];B[cp];W[cr];B[cn];W[dn];B[co];W[dm];B[br];W[dr];B[bm];W[bl];B[an];W[kq]C[W78 is steady. Zhou Heyang must already see clearly his inferior situation, so he treats W70's group lightly and starts to attack Black in the lower right corner.]
;B[do];W[eo];B[en];W[fo];B[fn];W[gn];B[el];W[qq];B[pq];W[qp]C[W86 and W88 are huge moves. Zhang Xuebin thinks, White catches up a lot here.];B[po];W[qo];B[kr]

;W[ko];B[jp];W[ip]LB[lo:a]C[W120: White can peep at 'a', later on extending and trying to capture Black's big dragon. The situation will be complicated. However, by Zhou's style, he will not play this way unless he has no other choices.];B[lp];W[eb];B[ea];W[bi];B[bj];W[da];B[jd];W[ke];B[fa]
;W[dc];B[nb];W[mn]LB[jo:a]C[W132 is not good. For White to play at 'a' is better, taking territory first. This way the game is still very close.];B[iq]C[Black is very relentless in the game but incurs loss in territory first. It can easily come to nothing.];W[hp];B[jo];W[ln];B[pr];W[hq]LB[jn:a]C[W138 eliminates aji, Now Black can extend at 'a' and also has the ambush of B113, so White has no other choices. In this local variation Zhou Heyang is not successful.]

;W[nk]LB[aj:a]C[W152 is to obtain sente, but in fact White still wants to play hane at 'a'.];B[mm];W[km];B[nn];W[aj]C[From the following process, we can see White takes advantage with W156, but Black pierces through with B145 and connects back B153, so White already incurs loss first.];B[cl];W[ck];B[dl];W[cj]C[Although White takes a lot of profit by W156 to W160, but Black is still a little favorable for the game. Finally White loses the game by half point.];B[fe];W[gl]
