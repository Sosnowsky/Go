Under an unfavorable situation, I eventually grabbed the very rare chance and advanced to the final quarter final.];W[pp]
;B[de];W[ce];B[cf];W[cd];B[dg];W[ef];B[eg];W[bf];B[ff]C[Black elects to play the joseki of B11 and B13, it seems damaging to territory.];W[ch];B[qn];W[nq];B[pj]
;W[od]LB[ld:a][nd:b]C[W18: I also considered to make the high two-space approach at 'b', in the game after Black plays the pincer at 'a', due to a great disparity in strength of stones, White can't launch a head-on confrontation.];B[ld];W[qc];B[rc];W[pc];B[re];W[of];B[pg];W[og]LB[mc:a][md:b][le:c][fc:d]C[White is difficult to select the order of W24 and W26, if White first plays the knight'move at 'a' and attach at 'b', after Black extends to 'c', White then jumps to 24, I'm worried that Black may tenuki to block at 'd' instead.]
;B[ph];W[mc];B[lc];W[md];B[qq]C[B30 entering the corner is a good move!];W[qp];B[rp];W[pq]LB[ro:a]C[Because Black is very thick on the right side, for White to play a hane at 'a' is somewhat meaningless, but in the game, White still feels grievous with the turn at 34.];B[rr];W[qr];B[rq]
;W[co]LB[do:a][cn:b][kq:c]C[The approaching move of W38 can not be criticized under normal situations, but in this case, because Black can play the good attach and cut moves at 'a' and 'b', the play of W38 becomes questionable. Now It would be better for White to simply make a two-space extension at 'c'.];B[do];W[dn];B[cn];W[bp];B[eo];W[cq]LB[cm:a][lq:b]C[White has no choice but to atari at 'a' with W44. In the game I feel that, if White ends in gote and is forced by Black at 'b', Black would be too adequate. In fact, White has to play this way.]
;B[bn];W[dr];B[er];W[eq];B[dp];W[fr];B[cr];W[es];B[bq]C[The sequence from B45 through B53 is inevitable for both sides, White has clearly incurred some losses in this variation.];W[gc]C[Fortunately, White gets to play the two-space extension with W54, still keeping balance in the game.];B[lf]LB[jq:a]C[The jump of B55 is a little slow, splitting at 'a' is bigger.]
;W[jp]C[After White extends to 56, the game becomes close.];B[hp];W[iq];B[on];W[id];B[if];W[je];B[kg]
(;W[jn]LB[le:a][ke:b][me:c][jd:d][jc:e][kd:f][lb:g][jo:h]C[W64: White wants badly to wedge at 'a', then B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f' and W 'g', however Black can then attach at 'h' to cultivate his center, Black's potential in the center is huge, this way White has no confidence (see var a).

After this move, it is time for noon break.];B[lb]C[The descent of B65 is very big, not only preventing White from crossing over and also threatening the big white group.];W[pe];B[qf];W[rb]
;B[sb];W[mg];B[jf];W[ge]LB[fc:a]C[If White doesn't strengthen with W72, after B 'a', White hanes underneath, Black's twist-cut on the second line would be severe.];B[fd];W[fc];B[li];W[oi];B[mj];W[ni];B[ok];W[pi]
;B[qi];W[qj]LB[qo:a][nn:b][qk:c]C[At that time I was very puzzled as to how to select the sequence of W80 and W82. If White first bumps at 'a' and attaches at 'b', then push and cut, something different would certainly happen. However after the exchange of W82 and B 'c', the value on the right side becomes smaller.];B[qk];W[qo];B[ro];W[nn];B[gp];W[hq];B[im];W[jm]
;B[il]LB[ib:a]C[Black has accomplished nothing with B89 and B91, Black should directly play at 'a'.];W[dj]C[After the knight's move of W92, it becomes a close game with White having a slight advantage.];B[pr]

;B[fn];W[fm]LB[cp:a][ck:b]TR[dn][en]C[The hane of W104 is careless! After the exchange with B 'a', the marked white stones become heavy, White should simply make the diagonal extension at 'b'.];B[cp];W[ck];B[em]LB[bl:a]C[After the atari of B107, White should calmly hane at 'a'.];W[fh];B[ei]
