;B[cf]LB[qo:a]C[B7 conforms to no conventional pattern, for Black to defend the corner at 'a' is quite common.];W[fc];B[cn];W[fp];B[cq]LB[gp:a]C[B11: Black simply enters the corner, which has more variations than playing the hane at 'a'.];W[dq];B[cp];W[do];B[cr];W[qo]
;B[qm];W[op]C[The variation after W18 is not necessarily to White's advantage.];B[oq];W[np];B[mq];W[mp];B[lq];W[lp];B[kq];W[nq];B[nr];W[mr];B[or]
;W[kp];B[jq];W[jp];B[iq];W[ip];B[qj]C[After B35, it seems that Black is relatively more beneficial.];W[ir];B[lr];W[nc];B[pf];W[kd];B[bd];W[cc]
;B[dh];W[cj];B[ci];W[ei];B[eh];W[fi];B[fh];W[gi];B[dr]LB[br:a]C[B51 looks small but is big in fact, if White gets to play here, immediately the clamp at 'a' is working.];W[qh];B[pi]C[B53 is a play of putting more importance on the center.]
;W[qe];B[pe];W[qd];B[qf];W[rf];B[rg];W[re];B[qg];W[pb]C[Through 62, White has gained some territory, but Black has obtained sente and Black's outside becomes very thick, containing White's development in the center.];B[on];W[rm];B[rl];W[pp]
;B[gq];W[hp];B[fn]C[B69 is relentless.];W[dn]C[The sequence after W70 is an inevitable counterattack.];B[cm];W[dm];B[cl];W[dl];B[dj];W[dk];B[ck];W[ej]
;B[di]TR[fn]C[Through 79, Black has obtained a considerable territory, this is perhaps the purpose of the marked black stone.];W[kk]C[The selection of W80 is relatively difficult, there is no final conclusion as to where is better to enclose territory.];B[ik]C[B81: Black doesn't give any inch and elects to invade into the opponent's territory, it seems that Black can fight.];W[jj]C[The play of W82 is worth study.];B[hi];W[gh];B[ii];W[jh]C[White has no certainty of success with the attack after W86.];B[gp];W[go]
;B[fo];W[gn];B[gm];W[fm];B[fl];W[em];B[hg];W[gg];B[ig];W[er]C[W98: White gives up attacking Black and turns to reinforce himself.];B[kf];W[lh];B[kg]
;W[hm];B[id];W[pm];B[ql];W[md];B[gd];W[gc];B[mf]C[Through 109, White's attack has clearly failed.];W[ij];B[hj];W[hk];B[ml]C[B113 is a good move, White is not comfortable.]
;W[mk]LB[lj:a]C[W114: White guards against Black's peep at 'a'.];B[nk];W[mj];B[lm];W[km];B[bc]C[The playing sequence and tempo after B119 is very brilliant.];W[hc];B[ic];W[hd];B[he];W[ge]
