;B[ok]C[The opening is very fast from both sides. The sequence from W12 to B19 is popular recently, as to White, there is nothing to complain.];W[oh]C[W20 is steady.];B[fo];W[dr];B[ce];W[kn];B[lp]LB[hq:a]C[With the exchange of W24 and B25, it is hard to judge who gains or incurs loss, originally White can directly invade at 'a'.

Yu Bin 9p thinks White incurs loss in the exchange.];W[dg];B[ee];W[fd];B[cc]C[B27 and B29 can be regarded as new moves, I didn't see before. I feel Xie He should have studied on these.]
;W[dd];B[cd];W[de];B[df];W[ef]LB[cf:a][cg:b][bf:c]C[If W34 at 'a', it will lead to a fierce fight, next Black plays at 34, White can connect at 'b' or descend at 'c', White seems not bad in either variation. In the game, Lee Sedol elected to simply play atari from top and is perhaps worried that Xie He may have some tactic, and Lee Sedol also didn't want to spend more time over here.];B[cf];W[ff];B[bh]C[Through B37, the situation is about even.];W[mc]C[White gets to force with W38 and can fight.]
;B[kc];W[me];B[ke]LB[mb:a][pc:b]C[B41: Black can attach over at 'a', but White can attach at 'b' and take the corner, Black will incur loss in territory. The fight at the top is very crucial and it will decide the final trend of this game. After study, we think, Black should defend in this area.];W[ic];B[ie];W[lg]LB[oe:a]C[W44: For White to jump at 'a' is thick. In the game, Black gets to play here, White's shape is thin.];B[oe];W[jf];B[ge]
;W[fe];B[hc];W[id];B[je];W[hd];B[ng]LB[jc:a][ib:b][md:c]C[But B53 appears too hasty, Black should bump at 'a' first to probe White, if White descends at 'b', Black has the tactic of playing wedge and connect at 'c'.];W[ob]C[The timing of W54 is very good, Black instead gets into trouble.];B[nb]C[B55 is strong and unyielding.];W[nc]
;B[mb];W[od];B[pc];W[lb];B[pb];W[ma];B[oa];W[lc]C[But through W64, Black damages his own five stones at the top, Black's losses outweigh his gains. Therefore, with B55, Black still should calmly retreat at 59.];B[nh];W[ni]C[W66 is strong, but White already takes a big risk, Lee Sedol's style is vivid on the board.];B[mi];W[nj]
;B[og];W[pi];B[lf];W[mf];B[mg];W[kg]C[Through W74, both sides have no way to retreat, this war most likely will decide the game.

];B[kb];W[ka];B[ja]LB[jb:a]C[B77: If Black retreats at 'a', can't see White has any tactic.];W[jb];B[la]
;W[kd];B[jd];W[ka];B[ld];W[ne];B[la];W[of];B[ka]C[B87: Black eliminates the ko and gains a huge profit.];W[lj]LB[pg:a]C[W88 looks like miscalculation, to hit at 'a' is the original move, this way White is still not good, but the board is still very big and White still can fight.];B[ph]C[The atari of B89 is good move, White already has no answer.];W[lh]LB[qh:a]C[W90: White continues to chase and kill, if Black pushes at 'a', White perhaps will collapse. Xie He should can use the noon break and calculate precisely the variations here.

After this move, it is time for noon break.]
;B[oi];W[oj];B[qi];W[oh];B[pf]C[B91 to B95 is good sequence, White has no choice but to sacrifice.];W[pg];B[nf]LB[oi:a]C[The play of B97 is a little inexplicable, don't know why not taking at 'a', White has no tactic to resist, this way Black is clearly better than the real game.];W[qh];B[qf]C[However, even if proceeding as in the game, White still incurs a heavy loss in this war, Black's advantage can be said decisive.];W[hq];B[eq]
;W[dq];B[hp];W[pm];B[om];W[pl];B[qr];W[rr];B[rq];W[rp];B[rs];W[sr];B[er]LB[iq:a]C[B113: For Black to hang at 'a' is more steady.]
;W[nq]C[Following W114, White plays strongly with great momentum, Xie He's response is very steady perhaps due to favorable consciousness.];B[lq];W[nn];B[mo];W[kq];B[kp];W[lr];B[mr];W[nr];B[no];W[mq];B[kr];W[ms]
;B[jq];W[pr]C[Through W128, White gains a lot and the situation becomes much closer, but Black is still clearly favorable, and the board becomes smaller.];B[pk];W[ol];B[nl];W[qm];B[nk];W[ho];B[gp];W[mn];B[on];W[ll];B[mm]
;W[ln];B[nm];W[bj];B[em];W[gm];B[mk];W[mj];B[cm];W[dn];B[ck];W[cj];B[ek];W[dm]
;B[dl];W[bm];B[gk];W[en];B[ik]C[B157 is not simple enough, if making life simply, White can win the game.];W[fm];B[jj];W[jl];B[dj];W[ch];B[cg];W[di];B[ei]LB[fj:a][hm:b]C[Following B165, Black makes some concession, Black can make diagonal at 'a', next W165 and B 'b', Black can go home.]
;W[fj];B[ej];W[fk];B[bk];W[eh];B[fi];W[gi];B[bi];W[gj]C[Through W174, White gains again, the situation becomes very close.];B[hb];W[if];B[fh]LB[he:a][ia:b]C[B177 is alert, if Black connects at 'a', White will block at 177, the situation will be completely turned around. In the game, White can capture two stones by playing hane at 'b', but Black can play hane-and-connect in the upper-left corner, so Black is still OK.]
;W[he];B[gh];W[hh];B[hg];W[ih]C[If not making any big mistake, Xie He can win this game by a small margin.];B[gf];W[gd];B[in];W[io];B[jo];W[jn];B[ig];W[hf]
