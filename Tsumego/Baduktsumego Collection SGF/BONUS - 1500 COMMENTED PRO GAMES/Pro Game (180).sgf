Copyright by gogameworld.com and weiqi.tom.com.];B[pd];W[pp];B[dd];W[cp]C[Both sides started with their favorite openings, in fast games, it is a simple and clever strategy.];B[qn]C[Gueon Hyojin and me did a thorough postgame analysis on this game, next I will tell some of our comments.]
;W[nq];B[rp];W[qf];B[nc];W[rd];B[qc];W[qi];B[qq];W[kq];B[cg];W[ep];B[ec];W[lc]LB[ck:a]C[W18 is a surprising move to me, now White perhaps should play at around 'a' and at the top, is W18 a good selection? Here I asked Gueon Hyojin, she also pointed out W18 is questionable, White should first play in the lower left at around 'a'.]
;B[jc];W[le];B[pf];W[pg];B[of];W[ph];B[je];W[lg];B[rc]C[The block of B27 is slow, making an extension on the left side is bigger, I agree.];W[nb];B[oc];W[ci]LB[cj:a]C[White forces again with W30, not sure whether White wants to play more positively or feels W18 can't be satisfied, at any rate this move seems unreasonable, to turn back and play at 'a' is not bad, in the game clearly Black is left with a proper invasion point.]
;B[ck];W[dj];B[dk];W[fj];B[ek];W[ej];B[gl];W[ij];B[il]C[Up to B39, White clearly incurs loss, now it is easier for Black to play.];W[ce];B[cd];W[eg];B[hj]LB[gq:a]C[B43 seems unnecessary, at the game time I wanted to make myself thicker, however I ended in gote, it is not worth it, therefore Black should invade at 'a' directly, there is no risk for Black.]

;B[mf];W[lf];B[hd];W[ee]LB[hp:a]C[W60 is one of Gueon Hyojin's very regrettable move, she said White should enclose territory at 'a' in the lower side, this way I would pay some price in territory because I played thickness. However, as for the variation in the center, Black also incurs some damage, through W60 White already has formed a territory of about 20 points.];B[gq]LB[er:a]C[Although Black gets to invade with B61, but since Black is very thick in the center, can Black invade deeper? for example at 'a'.];W[er];B[or]LB[go:a][pq:b]C[B63: If Black connects at 'a', White will surely block at 'b', I feel Black can't be satisfied, so on the back of my thick wall, I tried to grab points again.]
;W[oq];B[nr];W[mr];B[pq];W[ns];B[pr]C[So far, I believe all people must feel that White is relatively thin, to enclose territory is a little difficult.];W[fk];B[fl];W[em];B[el];W[hm];B[gk]LB[bi:a][bj:b][hl:c]C[The connection of B75 aims to put importance on the endgame of the attachment at 'a', in fact later on Black's diagonal at 'a' is sente as well, then the difference between 'a' and 'b' is two points, however if Black connects at 'c' with B75, it will have a impact on the outside which is more than two points. Here Black tries to save little but only to lose a lot!]
;W[hp];B[bi];W[bh];B[jn]LB[io:a][mq:b][jp:c][fo:d]C[B79 is of favorable consciousness, so it is somewhat loose. Gueon Hyojin was worried Black will play at 'a', because of the cut at 'b', so White probably will answer at 'c', then B 'd', this way Black would be much better than the real game.];W[ie];B[ic];W[jp];B[bj];W[bg]
;B[cn];W[bo];B[fo];W[gp];B[ld];W[md];B[kd];W[me];B[mc]C[So far, the game is to Black's advantage.];W[qm];B[rm];W[rl];B[rn]
;W[bn];B[ge];W[cm];B[ql];W[rk];B[hh];W[kh];B[gh];W[fi];B[if];W[lj];B[nh]LB[pm:a]C[Starting from B109, Black played several consecutive questionable moves, with B109, for Black to take at 'a' is the simplest and most clear move.]
;W[kl];B[jl];W[km];B[bl];W[pm]C[W114 is very big.];B[mh];W[ki];B[kk];W[lk];B[nj]LB[pn:a][op:b]C[B119: Black makes another mistake, Black should stick the head out at 'a' or 'b' to destroy territory.]
;W[pn];B[kn];W[ln];B[io];W[lo]C[Here White gets to enclose a territory of 10+ points .];B[ok]LB[fp:a][fq:b][ip:c][iq:d][hq:e][gr:f]C[B125 is not meticulous and precise enough, Gueon told me, here Black should exchange one sequence from the push of B 'a' to 'f', this way Black will take advantage in points, she thought obviously Black will win the game.];W[be]
;B[bd];W[hn];B[jm]C[White takes advantage in sente with the exchange of W128 and B129, the territory between both sides becomes closer again.];W[nl];B[ol];W[om];B[qk];W[rj];B[nk];W[ml];B[en]C[B137 is the fatal losing move, in the later exchange I incurred a 2+ point loss, in this kind of close game, two points are huge.];W[dm]
;B[ho];W[go];B[gn];W[fm];B[gm];W[fn];B[re];W[qe];B[qd]LB[rf:a][rg:b][qg:c][sd:d][oi:e][mj:f][rh:g][bm:h]C[B147: Black has missed the last change, Black should crawl at 'a', next W147, B 'b' and W 'c', here although the points are same as the real game, but the difference is Black takes sente and gets to play the big endgame at 'h', this way Black would be one point better in the game.]
;W[rf];B[sd];W[qo];B[ro];W[fd];B[fc];W[ad];B[ac];W[ae];B[bc];W[bm]C[After White connects with W158, now White will win the game by 2 points. At the end I gave away another point and lost the game by 3 points. ];B[ff];W[ef]
