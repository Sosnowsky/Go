Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[pd]C[In the final game of Nong Shim Cup, Chinese young player Wang Xi steps on the stage. This is the first time Wang Xi and Lee Changho face either other.];W[dp];B[qp];W[dd];B[op]C[The simple jump of B5 to enclose the corner is rare, but Lee Changho takes Black and plays very fast, obviously he has well prepared.]
;W[qj]C[The splitting move of W6 is just fine.];B[qh]C[Black's combined tactics following B7 have been basically evaded by White.];W[qm];B[pl]C[The set pattern following B9 is generally used later on in the game, however in the opening, to play this set pattern can be completely regarded as new moves.];W[ql];B[pj];W[pk];B[ok];W[qk];B[pi];W[ol];B[nk]C[Through B17, it is a local set pattern like a joseki, So far, the right side shape is exactly same as that in the game against Wang Lei. So it seems after one day's consideration, Lee Changho thinks this situation is to Black's advantage. After B17, how White to answer? It is indeed a difficult problem.]
;W[om]C[W18 reinforcing himself is the original move, but it also appears slow. If White takes tenuki, Black has the tactic of playing atari at 18 (see the game between Wang Lei and Lee Changho in the game 12).];B[jc];W[qc]LB[mq:a]C[W20 entering the corner at 3-3 is very big, but White seems to follow Black's footstep. With W20, White can also consider to force at 'a', this is also a much valuable move.];B[pc];W[qd];B[qe];W[re];B[rf]C[With the double atari of B25, Black tries to obtain sente, Black's overall game judgement is good.];W[qf];B[pe];W[rg]
;B[pf];W[qg];B[pg];W[qb];B[rh];W[sf];B[fq]C[Black obtains sente and approaches the corner with B35, Black gets to play on both sides, Black is leading in the game. And it can be said that Black's novel moves are successful.];W[cn];B[dr];W[fc];B[cl];W[cq];B[fo]
;W[gp]LB[en:a]C[The peep of W42 is an asking move, if Black connects, then White will jump to 'a'.];B[ep]C[Black counterattacks with B43.];W[en];B[dq];W[cp];B[eo];W[cr]C[Through W48, it forms a new shape, the gain and loss is not clear.];B[jq];W[mm];B[lp]LB[cf:a]C[B51 reinforcing himself is a surprising move, it is one thick play of Lee Changho's style. The common thinking is to approach at 'a', trying to use the center thickness efficiently.]
;W[ci];B[el];W[em]C[The bump of W54 is a strong move!];B[fl];W[gm]C[After White jumps out with W56, Black sinks into a crisis. If Black can't push and cut, Black's stone efficiency is not high.];B[do]C[B57 probes White, it is good timing.];W[cm]LB[dn:a]C[W58 is a mistake, it is too strong. With W58, White can only connect at 'a' to tight liberty. Although its position is no good, but to guard against Black's push and cut is the most urgent.];B[fm]C[After Black extends one liberty, Black bravely pushes and cuts with B59, White sinks into a difficult situation. It can be said that the push and cut of B59 is a decisive winning move.];W[fn];B[gn]
;W[mp]LB[go:a][hn:b][gq:c]C[The attachment of W62 is not a smart move, White can only atari at 'a', next B 'b' and W 'c', fighting a direct confrontation. However, after study, it is indeed a difficult fight for White.];B[pn]C[B63 is an asking move and good timing.];W[qn]LB[pm:a]C[The original move of W64 is to take at 'a', then Black will take tenuki to handle the lower left corner.];B[mo];W[kp];B[co];W[bo];B[cs]C[B67 and B69 are local good moves, White has been exploited terribly.]
;W[bq];B[bl];W[dl];B[dk];W[dm];B[ej]C[B75 again is a strong move.];W[bs]LB[go:a]C[W76: If White ataris at 'a', White's liberty is still not enough.];B[go]C[W76: White makes compromise, after Black connects with B77, Black obtains a huge profit.];W[lq];B[lo];W[kq]
;B[mq];W[mr];B[np];W[jr];B[pm]C[The value of the connection of B85 is huge, this is also the result of the earlier mistake of W64. So far, the game is basically over.];W[rp];B[rq]C[Afterwards, Black's play is relatively conservative, but Black keeps his victory to the end.];W[ro];B[jn];W[io];B[in];W[je]
