Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[pd]C[After losing the first two games, Yamashita Keigo played brilliantly and won back one game in the final game 3.];W[dd];B[qp];W[dq];B[do]
;W[co];B[dp];W[cp];B[eq];W[cn];B[lq]C[B11 is rarely seen.];W[dr]C[Generally speaking, allowing W12, Black can't be satisfied.];B[pj];W[nc];B[pf];W[kc];B[fo]
;W[cf]LB[lo:a]C[W18: In terms of the big picture, White should play at 'a', since W10 is iron head at the top, W10's value is not big, the bottom is more important.];B[lo];W[ep]LB[er:a]C[W20 itself doesn't put any pressure on Black, but if it is omitted, Black's block at 'a' will be too big.];B[je]C[B21 is a good point, Black's moyo is vivid, Black is leading in the opening.];W[ke];B[kd]C[As to the shape of W22, B23 is a common maneuver, worth remembering.];W[ld];B[jd];W[jc]
;B[ic];W[le];B[jf]C[B29: Black sticks the head out and Black's shape is very smooth, and also echoes the bottom, Black is happy.];W[ib];B[hc];W[hb];B[kg]C[B33 is a good move regarding the whole game, normally you can't allow to hane at the head of two stones, but now Black's moyo is huge, White has no time for this.];W[lg];B[lh];W[mg];B[ki];W[jh]
;B[kh];W[qh]C[W40: White can make life a small group, but this way White is certainly not good in terms of the whole game.];B[oc];W[nb];B[ph];W[qq]C[W44 is a planned move.];B[pq];W[rp];B[rq];W[qr];B[rr];W[ro]LB[pp:a]C[But next W50 is too heavy! White should first play atari at 'a' then crawl, White can dodge by borrowing strength.]
;B[pp]C[B51: Black eliminates all uses for other purposes, White instantly sinks into a bitter battle.];W[qk];B[ri];W[qm];B[rk]C[B53 and B55 are good moves! These two moves make White's eye shape inadequate, perhaps Cho Chikun overlooks it in the game.];W[pg]LB[og:a][pi:b][qj:c]C[W56 is a deceiving move. With B57, if Black plays atari at 'a' carelessly, after White's atari at 'b',  then W 'c', White can handle easily.];B[qj]C[Of course Yamashita Keigo who is good at attacking wouldn't fall into the trap, B57 avoids it, White is still in a bitter battle.];W[oh]
;B[qf];W[nl]C[Following W60, although White has saved his dead stones, White has paid a big price, now Black's situation is clearly favorable.];B[pl];W[nn];B[pm];W[pn];B[mm];W[om];B[oo];W[on];B[ni];W[nj];B[nh]
;W[lk];B[ng];W[jk];B[kl];W[kk];B[gq];W[gc]C[W78: White grabs territory desperately.];B[hk]C[But after the cap of B79, White seems to be hit on the head. Cho Chikun didn't give a play to his talent in this game.];W[km]C[Following W80, White flees in panic, although White connects home, but it is all dame moves.];B[lm];W[jl];B[kn]

;W[ce];B[hi]C[B121 and B123 are clever moves to tangle.];W[fh];B[fg];W[gh];B[dl];W[ij];B[fc];W[gd];B[fd];W[fe];B[ee];W[gp]LB[ge:a]C[W134: White obviously is confused, here White certainly can't take tenuki, White should play at 'a', this way the situation is a little unclear.]
;B[ge]C[B135: Black connects in sente, the game for White is as good as lost.];W[fb];B[hd];W[gb];B[hr];W[eg];B[dg];W[hh];B[ob];W[dh];B[ef];W[ec];B[ed]
