Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[In the game 4 of the 29th Japanese Kisei title match, the challenger Yuki Satoshi took White and successfully killed one big dragon of Hane Naoki, winning the game by resignation.];W[pq];B[cd];W[cp];B[po]
;W[qo];B[qn];W[qp];B[pn];W[nq];B[pj];W[nd];B[oc];W[ic]LB[od:a]C[W14: If White directly blocks, Black will attach at 'a' then pincer. W14 is light , nimble, and worth remembering.];B[od];W[ec];B[df]C[Time spent so far:

Hane: 1 hour and 41 minutes, Yuki: 1 hour and 19 minutes.

After this move, it is time for noon break.]
;W[qc]C[W18 is the follow-up tesuji in this shape.];B[gc]LB[rd:a]C[As to this, Black can only tolerate by playing at 'a'. In the game, Black counterattacks with B19, it is not hitting White's vital point.];W[rd]C[W20: White lives the corner in sente, it is too big!];B[qe];W[re];B[qb];W[rb];B[pc];W[rc];B[qf];W[rf]
;B[qg];W[ie];B[fd]C[After the diagonal of B31, in Black's corner, White is still left with the tactic of initiating ko and making life in the corner, Black's gain actually is very small, White's opening is successful.];W[ck];B[eq];W[do];B[kd]C[Time spent so far:

Hane: 5 hour and 7 minutes, Yuki: 5 hours and 14 minutes.

After this move, the game was closed for the first day.];W[cc];B[bc];W[jf]LB[ke:a]C[W38: White can consider to attach at 'a', while dodging, the closer you are to the opponent, the easier to make life.];B[jh]C[With the sequence following B39, Black strengthens the corner by attacking, Black's profit is big, the situation is even now.]
;W[ih];B[ji];W[jg];B[ii];W[hh];B[hi];W[gh];B[ed];W[gi];B[hq];W[ch];B[lq]LB[gj:a]C[B51 is a big slow move! Now the key is both sides' reduction and expansion in the center, so to take initiative, you have to control the center! Black should play hane at 'a'.]
;W[hj]C[In the real game, after Black misses the vital point, W52 is a good move to take control of the center!];B[fo]C[After failing to control the center, Black has to play inside White's thick area, Black is indeed very painful! White therefore takes initiative.

Time spent so far:

Hane: 5 hours 7 minutes, Yuki: 5 hours and 14 minutes.

After this move, it is time for noon break.];W[io]LB[gp:a][iq:b]C[W54 is again a top-notch good move of Yuki Satoshi! White aims at 'a' by using center thickness and also plans to attach down at 'b' and initiate the ko by using favorable ko threats in the upper left corner, overall Black is very hard to handle.];B[fm]LB[fp:a][hp:b]C[B55: In the game, Black simply takes tenuki twice and ignores it, but White pierces through with the sequence following W 'a', it is still too big. Perhaps with B55 Black can only tolerate by playing at 'b', seeking a chance to fight.];W[iq];B[ir];W[hp]
;B[jq];W[fp];B[ip];W[gp];B[hn];W[jp];B[kp];W[iq];B[gr];W[ep];B[gj]C[The cut of B60 is clearly a game-deciding move, now if simply escaping, Black already has no hope of winning the game.];W[gq];B[ip]
;W[bd];B[dc];W[iq];B[hr];W[ij]C[W76 is tight!];B[gk];W[jj];B[li];W[kj];B[lh];W[jm]C[next by using the sente moves W78 and W80, White seals off Black with W82, it is simple and powerful.];B[dj]LB[ej:a]C[B83 is unreasonable! Black can only run at 'a', this way although even if Black lives, Black is no good either, but Black at least can continue. Of course, Hane Naoki already has no confidence to fight any more, in fact this is just the real defeat.]
;W[fj];B[fk];W[ek]C[White hanes and cuts strongly with W84 and W86, Black sinks into a hopeless situation!

At 16:09, Hane Naoki only has 20 minutes left.];B[jl];W[il];B[im];W[in];B[hm];W[kl];B[jn];W[km];B[dn];W[dk]
;B[cn];W[en];B[em];W[fn];B[cl]C[At 16:54, Yuki still has 30 minutes left.];W[bk];B[dq];W[dm];B[dl];W[el];B[bp];W[bq];B[bn]
;W[cq];B[bl];W[fl];B[gm];W[co];B[ej];W[gl];B[fi];W[hk];B[fj];W[fh];B[dh];W[dg]
;B[ci];W[di]C[Black's following struggle is meaningless, in the end Yuki achieves a complete victory by using the beautiful tesuji of W124.

The game 5 will take place on 2/24-2/25.])
