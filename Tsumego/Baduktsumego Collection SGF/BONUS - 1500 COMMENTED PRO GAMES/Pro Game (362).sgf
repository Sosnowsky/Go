Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[pd];W[dp];B[fq]C[B3, directly approaching the corner, I used this move before.];W[hq]C[See how White to respond then decide how Black to play in the lower right corner.];B[pq]
;W[dd];B[cf];W[fc];B[bd];W[cc];B[ci];W[cn];B[jq];W[qf];B[qi]C[The low two-space pincer of B15 is rarely seen.];W[nc];B[pf];W[pg]
;B[of];W[qc];B[qe];W[pc];B[rf]C[White elects to play the simplest variation, Black is successful in the opening.];W[qo];B[pm];W[qm];B[ql]C[After the exchange of W26 and B27, ...];W[op];B[oq]LB[pp:a][on:b]C[When Black presses with W28, with B29 Black can't push and cut at 'a', otherwise White can block or jump to 'b'.]
;W[np]C[In the game, after W28 and W30, the exchange of W26 and B27 is damaging to White, so Black didn't elect to push and cut.];B[nq];W[pl];B[om];W[rm];B[qk];W[mp];B[mq];W[lp];B[kq]LB[mm:a]C[W40: White should cap at 'a'. In post game analysis, Lee Changho said he can't be satisfied with this cap and want to play more positively.];W[pj]C[Therefore White plays W40, but it is a little unreasonable.]
;B[pk]C[After Black pushes and cuts with B41, White has no way to retreat and can only face fight.];W[ol];B[nm];W[ok];B[qj];W[mk];B[ml]LB[lk:a][oj:b]C[When B47, White still should stick head out at 'a' with W48, its value is huge! Even if B 'b' makes White very painful.];W[oj];B[lk];W[lj]
;B[kk];W[rq];B[ko]LB[qq:a][li:b]C[After long meditation, I elected to play B53. At that time, I thought to bump at 'a' or pincer at 'b', but I want to make myself thick first then attack.];W[qr]C[In fact, I still should attack first.];B[li];W[mj];B[kj];W[ng];B[md];W[mc]
;B[mi];W[ni];B[pi]C[B61 and B63 are good moves! These two are my proudest moves of this game.];W[mh]C[Black's these two moves hit on White's key point.];B[nj];W[nk];B[oi]LB[mf:a]C[But the play of B65 and B67 is a little hasty, Black should seal off by jumping to 'a', this way White will be more difficult.];W[me]C[In the game, White obtains sente and gets to turn body around.];B[nl]C[Now the situation is still to Black's advantage. After capturing nine stones, Black becomes very thick, which is very helpful for future fight and endgame.];W[fp]
;B[dq]LB[eq:a]C[B71 is good move at this situation. If Black extends at 'a', White will give up W4 one stone.];W[eq];B[er];W[ep];B[cr];W[cq];B[dr];W[bq];B[gq];W[gp];B[hr];W[lh]
;B[ki];W[jg]C[W82 and W84: White expands his moyo at maximum limit.];B[kd]C[Black has to invade.];W[nd];B[gc];W[gd];B[hc];W[fb];B[if]C[Through B91, White is difficult to attack efficiently and White's territory is not enough.];W[dh];B[ch];W[df]LB[ce:a]C[B95 at 'a' is the strongest response, Black can take more advantage and White is still difficult to kill Black at top.]
;B[ig]LB[hd:a]C[Black retreats a little considering favorable situation. With B95 Black can turn at 'a'.];W[ce];B[dg];W[eg];B[cg];W[be];B[ef];W[ff];B[de];W[ee];B[df];W[fe]
;B[cl];W[lq];B[lr];W[kr];B[jr];W[pp];B[hd];W[kb];B[ge];W[ad];B[fd];W[ed];B[jb]C[B119: Black makes himself thick.]
;W[jc]C[White counterattacks with W120, but it is not to White's advantage.];B[kc];W[ib];B[le]C[The following sequence is one-way street.];W[nf];B[lb];W[ja];B[lc];W[mb];B[la];W[gb];B[rd]C[B131: After grabbing the last biggest endgame, Black wins the game for sure.]
;W[rc];B[mf];W[ld];B[hb];W[ha];B[md];W[ne];B[kg]LB[bm:a][bn:b]C[B139: Black can consider to make diagonal at 'a', after W 'b', then B139.];W[bk]C[W140: White fights desperately.];B[bl]
;W[ck];B[dk];W[dl]C[But the result is not to White's favor.];B[ek];W[al];B[el]LB[fg:a]C[B147: Black should directly capture at 'a'.];W[dm];B[bj];W[bm];B[fg];W[gg]
;B[fh];W[he]C[W154 is good move!];B[ie];W[hf]LB[id:a][hk:b]C[White is left with two good points, to capture several stones at 'a' and destroy territory at 'b'.];B[gh];W[mr];B[ks];W[pr];B[nr];W[hm]
;B[id];W[hk];B[qq];W[qp];B[ma]C[But since Black is too thick, Black has many "hidden" points.];W[na];B[cj]C[Till the end, Lee Changho failed to turn the game around.];W[cm];B[rr];W[rs];B[fm];W[gm]
