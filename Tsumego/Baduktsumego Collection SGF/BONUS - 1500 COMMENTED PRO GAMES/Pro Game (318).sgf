Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[As for outsiders, to see the decisive game 5 is of course very enjoyable, but as to Gu Li who lost two straight games after winning the first two, he faces the biggest and most difficult challenge of his career, how does he feel? We are waiting for the decisive game 5 on 4/21.];W[dd];B[pq];W[oc]C[W4: Chen Yaoye likes to play this way.];B[dp]
;W[po];B[pe];W[qj]C[Chen Yaoye thinks White's opening up to W8 is not bad, not sure how Gu Li judges.];B[nq];W[qg];B[nd]LB[pc:a]C[B11: Black can consider to defend at 'a'.];W[nc];B[md];W[mc];B[ld];W[kc]
;B[ql]C[The sequence from B11 to B17 is attack-oriented, but at the top Black's shape is over-concentrated and not comfortable.];W[og]C[W18 is the vital point.];B[ol];W[od];B[oe];W[nf];B[ne];W[lf];B[kd];W[jc];B[jd];W[id]
;B[ie];W[hd]C[Next, up to W30, White's tempo is smooth and happy.];B[cc]LB[ce:a]C[When the top shape appears, B31 striking the corner is a move that can't be omitted in the eye of modern players, since it makes a huge difference comparing with W 'a' protecting the corner.];W[jf];B[je];W[dc];B[cd];W[cf];B[bf]LB[no:a]C[Since W 'a' is also huge  with B37 Black can consider to play at 'a', this way White also can't enclose the corner with just one move.]
;W[qq];B[qr];W[no];B[oj]C[B41 is related to the thickness and thinness of both sides and can't be omitted.];W[lo];B[qp];W[qo];B[on];W[oo];B[rp]C[B45 and B47 are good order, if Black plays B47 first, Black can't play B45 any more.];W[pp];B[rq]
;W[mq]C[W50 is a slow move.];B[jg]C[B51: Black gets to strike first.];W[pk]C[W52: White is forced to defend, Black takes advantage.];B[ok];W[pi];B[oi];W[ph];B[qk];W[pj];B[rn];W[fq];B[kq]
;W[oq];B[or];W[jp];B[mr];W[np];B[op];W[lq];B[kp];W[ko];B[kr];W[oq];B[nr];W[in]
;B[eq];W[fp];B[cn];W[de];B[cg];W[cb];B[kf]LB[bh:a]C[B81 is perhaps favorable consciousness! Black can play at 'a' first and see how White to attack.];W[be];B[ce];W[df];B[bd];W[bg]LB[ch:a]C[Reinforcing is certainly the original move, but to capture at 'a' in a ladder is too big!]
;B[ae];W[ch];B[bb];W[cq];B[dq];W[cl]C[W90 and W92 are good order!];B[en]LB[bp:a][cp:b]C[This way Black then jumps with B93, after W94, White is left with the tactic of living the corner at 'a', just because of that, White starts to take the lead. Therefore with B93 for Black to protect the corner at 'b' is still better.];W[bp];B[bo];W[cp]
;B[do];W[br];B[lp]C[B99 is an asking move.];W[dm]C[The counterattack of W100 is severe! The situation enters into Chen Yaoye's tempo.];B[dr];W[co];B[dn];W[bn];B[bm];W[ao];B[cm];W[dl]
;B[gn];W[hp];B[mo];W[fm]C[When B111, White again counter-attacks with W112, Chen Yaoye's momentum is very strong.];B[gm];W[fl];B[go];W[il];B[gl];W[gk];B[jm];W[im];B[hk]
;W[ik];B[hj];W[hl];B[hr];W[hq];B[fr];W[ir];B[gr];W[mn];B[mp];W[nn]C[Through W132, although both sides get to settle and solve the problem peacefully, but overall Black's territory is already inadequate.];B[lm];W[ln]
;B[rf]C[Following B135, Black wants to take advantage by attacking, but White's eye shape is very rich, Black is difficult to achieve his goal.];W[rg];B[rk];W[rj];B[pf];W[mh];B[li];W[kg];B[if];W[kh];B[nh];W[mg];B[lh]
;W[mi];B[lj];W[ji]LB[qm:a]C[After W148 and W150, since Black has the defect at 'a', Black has to defend.];B[pl];W[lg]C[After White connects safely with W152, originally White can win the game very quickly.];B[fi];W[hi];B[gj];W[fk];B[di];W[eh]

;W[kl];B[jl];W[km];B[fe];W[gf];B[ge];W[gd];B[le];W[ro];B[so];W[ff]LB[re:a]C[But with W182 the young and vigorous Chen Yaoye is reluctant to simply strengthen and make life at 'a'.];B[ng]
;W[of];B[he];W[gg];B[hh];W[eb];B[mf]C[B189: Black initiates a ko fight, the situation is chaotic.];W[me];B[ml];W[nl];B[mf];W[sf];B[sj];W[me]

;B[mf];W[qe];B[rc];W[me];B[kb]LB[mb:a][fd:b]C[In fact, after the exchange of B227 and W 'a', Black can break through at 'b', Black already obtains a big profit in the endgame.];W[mb]LB[pb:a]C[B229: If Black gives up ko fight and comes back to play endgame at 'a' , Black's situation is already not bad.];B[mf]C[However when the chance comes, with B229 Black takes the ko carelessly, it is a big mistake!];W[pd]C[White cuts with W230 in a hurry.]
;B[qb];W[pb];B[sd];W[me];B[ic];W[jb];B[mf];W[si];B[sg];W[qa]C[However White cleverly first plays hane with W240 then throws in, Black is clearly not favorable in ko threats, Gu Li can only sign in despair while looking at the ko.];B[ra];W[qc];B[pc]
