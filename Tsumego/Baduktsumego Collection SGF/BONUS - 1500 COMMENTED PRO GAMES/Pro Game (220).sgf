Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[Black is Lee Changho 9P of Korea];W[dc]C[White is Hu YaoYu 7P of China];B[dq]C[Chang Hao's defeat puts a heavy burden on Hu Yaoyu who takes the task to stop Lee Changho from advancing. Although the overall record between them is Hu 2:1, but this can't say in this Chunlan Cup Hu Yaoyu has a psychological advantage, because the more critical moment it is, the more powerful Lee Changho will be!];W[pp];B[ce]
;W[ck]C[White plays the splitting move of W6, aiming to break up the situation, Hu Yaoyu is patient.

Lee Changho is pondering.];B[dd]LB[ci:a][di:b]C[B7: Black plays on his own, normally after White plays at 'a' or the three-space high pincer at 'b', then Black will elect to make the small diagonal of B7.];W[ec];B[cc];W[cb];B[bc];W[co]LB[hc:a]C[W12: White takes tenuki, it is a state of mind, normally to make the two-space extension at 'a' is also possible, Black's corner is very solid, W6 is able to stay a little farther, White should have nothing to complain.];B[hc]C[The value of the forcing move B13 is very big, White's following set pattern always seems far-fetched, but couldn't find a better way.]
;W[ed];B[ee];W[gd];B[hd];W[fe];B[ef];W[ff];B[eg];W[gc];B[cm]C[The invasion of B23 is not intended to attack and kill White, instead Black wants to set the shape in the lower left corner in sente.];W[eo];B[gq];W[dl]
;B[cp];W[bo];B[nc];W[qj];B[qh];W[iq]C[The checking move of W32 is correct, the aji in Black's corner is plentiful, White must take advantage of it.];B[nq];W[oq];B[np];W[pn];B[kq];W[gp];B[fq]
;W[hp];B[do];W[dn];B[dp]C[After this move, it is time for noon break, to be continued at 1pm.];W[cn];B[en];W[fo];B[bp];W[ap];B[aq];W[ao];B[br];W[em]LB[ko:a][nn:b][mo:c]C[The atari of W52 is a slow move! Chang Hao and Gu Li has been watching this game closely, both think White shouldn't reinforce himself this easily. The most positive play for White is to cap at 'a', this move aims to attack Black and also take his own defects into account. Next Black jumps to 'b', and White strikes at 'c', then White can play hane and connect on the second line to take advantage again, this would be better than the real game.]
;B[ko];W[jc];B[qq]C[B55 entering the corner is good timing.];W[qp]C[White has no choice but to tolerate with W56, Black takes profit.];B[or];W[pq];B[jd];W[kd];B[kc];W[oc]C[The attachment of W62 is very light and nimble, White takes the corner territory by using Black's aji on the left side, however Black's outside influence also can't be underestimated.];B[ke];W[qc]
;B[pd];W[pc];B[od];W[nb];B[mc];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[ql]TR[qp]C[The invasion of B73 is very severe! The earlier conservative move (the marked stone) doesn't bring Black safety.];W[pk];B[pr];W[qr]
;B[qn]C[The attachment of B77 is the shape, White is very painful.];W[om];B[rq];W[rr];B[pl];W[ol];B[rp];W[ro];B[qo];W[sq];B[po]C[In the game, White can't do anything but to watch Black to atari out with B87. Black not only destroys White's side territory and also makes White have one more lonely group, Black's profit is big, Black takes the lead.];W[sp]
;B[oo];W[nj];B[pi]C[The small diagonal of B91 is a calm and good move. Although Black doesn't seem to have a very severe next move, but White is very hard to fix his shape, Black's influence in the upper right is put into use.];W[mi];B[ll];W[ml];B[mk];W[nk];B[mm];W[ng];B[mb];W[qe]C[W100: White seeks a chance of fighting, Black's answer is very simple and clear. Black simply sacrifices two stones to make the outside thicker, putting more pressure on White's lonely stones, it is not to White's advantage.]
;B[qf];W[pe];B[oe];W[pf];B[of];W[pg];B[og];W[qg];B[rg];W[rf];B[ph];W[se];B[nh]C[It is not hard to find out that in the following process, Black already starts to call off the battle. After all shapes are settled, Black is leading about 10 points on the board.]
