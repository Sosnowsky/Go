Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[pd]C[In the final game 1 of the Korean 10th GS Caltex Cup (the original LG Refined Oil Cup), the defending champion Lee Changho 9p (Black) defeated Choi Cheolhan 9p by resignation, taking 1:0 lead. The overall record between them is tied at 11:11.];W[dd];B[qp];W[dp];B[fq]
;W[hq];B[cn];W[fp];B[cq]C[The variation following B7 and B9 is very popular in Korea recently.];W[cp];B[dq];W[ep];B[eq];W[bp];B[gq];W[gp];B[hr];W[iq]
;B[ir];W[jq];B[dj]LB[cj:a][cl:b][dg:c][dl:d]C[B21 is the latest improvement, in the past it was always making the low extension at 'a', then White invades at 'b'. Now if White still can invade at 'b', Black can approach the corner at 'c' first then press at 'd', Black is not bad.];W[ch];B[dl];W[gl];B[ei];W[gi]C[The attacking direction of W24 and W26 is correct.];B[dh]
;W[dg]LB[cf:a]C[But W28 is too strong, White shouldn't tangle over here, White should jump to 'a' to obtain sente.];B[cg]C[The counterattack of W29 is very severe!];W[bh];B[eg]LB[bg:a]C[B31 is Lee Changho's first-class steady move, to block at 'a' is the most severe move.];W[df];B[ci];W[bi];B[bj];W[ck]
;B[cj];W[fh];B[eh];W[cf];B[eb];W[gb]LB[ec:a]C[With W42, White has no assurance of success! White should play at 'a'.];B[dc]C[B43 is a clever move!];W[cc];B[ed];W[cb];B[de]
;W[ef];B[cd]C[After Black takes ponnuki with B49, White already can't attack Black.];W[bd];B[hc]C[B51 is to initiate ko, the following sequence is all under Black's control.];W[gc];B[gd];W[hd];B[be];W[ce];B[fd];W[ic];B[bc]
;W[dd];B[hb];W[ib];B[cd];W[ad];B[ae];W[dd];B[he];W[ee];B[id]C[Through B69, White fails in the counterattack and incurs a big loss.];W[kc];B[ia];W[ja]
;B[ha];W[nc];B[oc];W[nd];B[pf];W[qc]C[White enters the corner with W78 regardless of the well-being on the side, it is a desperate-fighting tactic.];B[ob];W[qe];B[pe];W[rf];B[qf];W[re];B[qh]
;W[rg];B[jc]C[B87 is the vital point, Black kills White slowly, White sinks into a big bitter fight.];W[lf];B[kd]LB[oh:a]C[It is hard to believe B89 is Lee Changho's move! This is too small, Black should jump to 'a', this way Black will take a big lead.];W[ld];B[lc];W[qg]C[Lee Changho obviously overlooks White's counterattack of W92!];B[pg];W[ph];B[oh]C[Following B95, Black pays a dear price, taking the risk to capture White at the top, a very wrong strategy!]

;B[ji]LB[jg:a][mh:b]C[B109: Black faces some test, if Black kills White strongly by playing at 'a', after White ataris at 'b', White can push and cut, the variation will be very complicated, Black has no certainty of success. In the real game, White is able to escape, Lee Changho must feel very painful!];W[ih]LB[jg:a]C[W110 is too vicious! White should make life at 'a', this way Black will gain nothing in the attack!];B[le];W[ke];B[md];W[me];B[ld];W[nf];B[je]
;W[og];B[nb];W[li];B[mh];W[mi];B[ni]C[As to the sacrificing move of W120, B123 sticking the head out is a good move! Since Black doesn't need to reduce liberties, Black can capture very big, White can't be satisfied.];W[lk];B[mk];W[mj]C[W126 is tight, in close-contact fights, you can't afford to play loose and slow moves.];B[ml];W[ol];B[nk]

;B[nm];W[mn];B[mo];W[nn];B[lp];W[no]LB[on:a]C[White's sequence following W148 is too crude! White should simply extend at 'a', this way Black is not easy to enclose territory in the corner, White perhaps would still have chances.];B[np];W[op];B[oq];W[nq];B[mp];W[po]
;B[pp];W[oo];B[or];W[qo];B[rp];W[ko];B[lo];W[kf]C[In the game, although White grabs the big endgame with W162, ...];B[jm]C[.., but being exploited by Black following B163, White doesn't have anything in the center, and Black instead gains a lot.];W[jl];B[in];W[km]
