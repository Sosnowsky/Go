Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[In the preliminary round 5, Yu Bin 9p defeated An Choyoung 9p by resignation, only one step away from the main event.];W[dd];B[pq];W[dq];B[co]
;W[ck];B[gq];W[ep];B[jp]LB[pd:a]C[B7 and B9 are most used when B1 at 'a' the star point, the play in the game is rarely seen.];W[oc]LB[cp:a]C[W10: For White to make diagonal at 'a' is a huge move locally. In the game, White elects to approach the corner and aims to destroy opponent's intentions.];B[bq]LB[dl:a]C[B11 puts emphasis on territory, besides this, to play at 'a' is also playable.];W[dn];B[cn]
;W[dm];B[cm];W[dl];B[md];W[qo]C[W18 looks like a normal corner approach, in fact White tries to trap Black to come and pincer-attack.];B[pl]LB[op:a]C[B19: Black falls into trap! Black should defend at 'a'.];W[lq]C[W20 is severe, since White is thick on the left side, it is already not a simple invasion, on the back of W18, White means to attack!];B[po];W[jr]C[W22: White obtains the base.];B[go]
;W[br]C[W24 is the vital point in this shape.];B[cq];W[cr];B[bl];W[lo]C[After the jump of W28, Black can't look after both sides and sinks into passivity.];B[bk];W[pp]C[The wedge of W30 is severe, locally Black doesn't have answer.];B[op]LB[qp:a]C[B31 is also very big, but if expecting the game result, Black still should try to grab more urgent point at 'a'.];W[qp];B[qq]LB[or:a]C[B33: Black selects to fight strongly when Black itself is weak, this is not clever, although painful, Black still should defend at 'a'.]
;W[oo];B[pn];W[oq]C[W34 and W36 are all strongest moves, Black is about to collapse.];B[np];W[nq];B[mp];W[lp];B[qn];W[rn];B[rq];W[ro];B[nn];W[rl]
;B[rm]LB[ql:a]C[B47: Black has no choice but to give one stone, if simply B 'a', Black will connect at 47, Black's liberty in the corner is already not enough.];W[qm];B[ql];W[sm];B[pm];W[qk];B[pk];W[qj];B[rm];W[rj];B[sn]LB[or:a]C[B57: Black makes life the corner, but Black is too convenient, Black's situation is clearly not good.]
;W[qm];B[er];W[rm];B[dr]C[In the game, the ko fight leads an exchange , White obtains more territory at the bottom, White is leading the game.];W[pr];B[cf];W[dh];B[eg]LB[fc:a]C[B65: For Black to fight at 'a' on the upper side is bigger.];W[fc];B[eh]C[Black attacks White strongly on the left side, it is a desperate play in an unfavorable situation.];W[gn]LB[gl:a]C[W68: For White to play at 'a' is better for eye shape.]
;B[fn];W[gm];B[fm];W[fl];B[fo];W[gl];B[dj]C[B75 is the vital point! Aiming to wedge and cut, White is not comfortable.];W[ce];B[jm];W[bf];B[bg];W[df];B[dg]
;W[cg];B[ch];W[il];B[jl];W[ik];B[ii];W[jk];B[ki];W[lj]LB[jo:a]C[White lives in dame moves following W90. For White to make life at 'a' by counter-attacking will be better than the real game.];B[ll];W[kk];B[ni]
;W[li];B[lh];W[mh];B[mi];W[kh];B[lg];W[ji];B[jh];W[kj];B[jg]C[Black builds influence on the outside, White's play is too passive.];W[mn];B[hc]C[After B105, White's situation is still a little better, but the situation already becomes much closer.]
;W[mc]C[W106: White's seeking life quickly is very clever.];B[lc];W[ld];B[me];W[mb];B[kc];W[qb];B[cf];W[oi]C[W114: White is reluctant to retreat, showing Yu Bin feels his situation is not optimistic.];B[mk];W[in];B[od]
;W[pc];B[pd];W[rc];B[be]LB[jn:a]C[At this crucial moment, Black starts the ko with B121, it is too hasty! Black should first create ko threats at 'a', this way Black may still have chance.];W[cg];B[jn]C[B123 is not ko threat.];W[cf];B[im]C[Black wants to kill White's big dragon, it is impossible.];W[hm];B[ek];W[kl]
;B[lm];W[ho];B[hp];W[kn];B[el];W[bh]C[Black kills the tail, comparing with losing the ko fight on the left side, Black instead incurs loss, Black suddenly shows a losing trend.];B[ci];W[no];B[km];W[jo];B[bi];W[oj];B[mm]
