Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[In the first round of 11th NEC Cup, Yu Bin who advanced to the main event for the first time in the last five years defeated Ma Xiaobing 3p, moving to the next round.];W[dd];B[pp];W[dq];B[fc]
;W[cf];B[kc];W[qj];B[qg];W[qn];B[mq]C[The play of B9 and B11 is relatively rare, not sure whether Yu Bin has spent time to study this or it is just a play on the spot in fast games.];W[rp];B[qq];W[pl]C[Black is able to protect the corner, the knight's move of W14 is also a good shape.];B[do];W[co];B[cn]
;W[cp];B[dm];W[ic]LB[fq:a]C[W20: White didn't jump to 'a' as joseki, White's thinking is correct.];B[ci];W[dc];B[fe];W[ie];B[dg];W[cg];B[dh];W[ig];B[ke]
;W[gh];B[df];W[de];B[hd];W[id]LB[fg:a]C[The exchange of B33 and W34 is damaging, in fact for Black to strengthen by jumping at 'a' is the original move.];B[kg]C[Black takes tenuki and jumps with B35, it is clearly unreasonable.];W[ei]LB[ff:a]C[W36 is a very bad move! Also White loses a chance to win the game at one stroke. With W36 White should attach and cut at 'a', this is very severe! Black most likely will be captured.];B[fg]C[In the real game, Black takes chance to strengthen the cut, Black instead gains profit by misfortune.];W[ii]
;B[gj];W[gi];B[fj];W[oc];B[pc];W[od]LB[mc:a][ld:b][oe:c]C[W42 and W44 seem heavy. With W42 White should first invade at 'a' to probe Black. If Black still plays at 'b', White can play at 42 or 44; If Black makes the diagonal at 43, White will jump to 'c' instead of making the extension at 44, this will be more light and nimble.];B[pf];W[mc];B[ld];W[nf]
;B[ng]C[The fight following W49 is chaotic, nobody can predict the result, both sides gain some profit.];W[lf];B[ne];W[pe];B[qe];W[of];B[me];W[pg];B[qf];W[oe];B[mf];W[og];B[nh]
;W[pi];B[hj];W[eh];B[be];W[ce];B[dk];W[ij];B[jh];W[ih];B[kj];W[il];B[fr];W[eo]
;B[go]LB[fq:a][ep:b][gp:c]C[B73 and B75 are superficially clever. With B73, for Black to force at 'a' is still better, next W 'b' and B 'c'.];W[dp]C[White plays W74 and ataris with W76 tightly, White gains a lot.];B[kl];W[dj]LB[ek:a][ej:b][el:c][fl:d][cj:e][cl:f]C[The diagonal of W78 is a big crude move! This is also the losing cause of this game. White certainly should simply attach at 'a', Black always can't push at 'b', Black can only hang at 'c', next W 'b' and B 'd'. Since the exchange of W78 and B 'e' is saved, White has the tactic of striking at 'f', Black is very difficult.]
;B[cj];W[ek];B[el];W[ej];B[fl];W[jl];B[km];W[hn];B[ho];W[io];B[ip];W[in]LB[fk:a]C[With W86 to W90, in order to keep the tactic of capturing three stones at 'a', White makes Black's side territory thicker, White is very painful, in fact it also means White's territory is already not adequate.]

;W[mi];B[lh];W[lj];B[kk];W[ri];B[on]C[The play of B103 and B109 is very thick, White already has no chance to turn the game around.];W[sf];B[gm];W[gn];B[fn];W[hm];B[se];W[gl]
