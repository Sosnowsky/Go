;W[cf];B[cd];W[dg];B[ef];W[eg];B[cp];W[eq];B[cm];W[oc];B[jq]C[B15: Liu Jing 8p thinks, this move is very thoughtful, although it is hard to decide its gain or loss. In terms of opening, Peng Quan's play is very bold.];W[qf];B[pe]LB[od:a][nd:b][oe:c][pc:d][qe:e][qc:f]C[B17: Wang Lei 8p played the variation from B 'a' to W 'f', White enters the corner, this is also playable. However, Wang Lei, who is familiar with Peng Quan, said: "Peng Quan wouldn't play this way, since he feels it is damaging to territory."]
;W[pf];B[oe]LB[nd:a][mc:b][pc:c]C[B19: Huang Yizhong shows the variation of B 'a', W 'b' and B 'c', this is also possible.];W[of];B[ne];W[lc];B[ff]LB[df:a]C[B23 is very thoughtful, its original purpose is allow White to connect at 'a', then Black makes one-space jump. This way Black takes advantage in the exchange.];W[ic]C[In the game, White simply jumps with W24 and sees through Peng Quan's intention, leaving the problem to Black. Black incurs loss in the exchange of B23 and W24.];B[df]
;W[bg];B[fg]LB[cj:a]C[B25 and B27 are focus point of the first argument. Most pros think, with B25 or B27, Black should make two-space extension at 'a'.];W[be]C[W28: White easily makes life. Zhou Ruiyang thinks, White gets to play W28 and is easier to play in the game.];B[ob]C[B29 is joseki, White has many choices.];W[nb]C[W30 is the most common answer.];B[pb];W[qj];B[hb]C[B29 and B33: Gu Li 9p said, I don't understand Peng Quan's moves, he always likes to play in the second or third line, this way there is no enough attacking power and you can't win the game.];W[pc];B[qc]
;W[oa];B[qb];W[ib];B[hc];W[hq];B[nq];W[pn];B[jo];W[cq];B[bq];W[dq]C[W44 and W46: Niu Yutian 6p and Li Zhe 5p said they don't understand these two moves.];B[cj];W[bc]C[Wang Xi imagined perhaps Imamura Toshiya's original purpose is force Black to play B47, then White gets to enter the corner.]
;B[ql];W[pk];B[qo];W[qp];B[po];W[oo];B[qn];W[np];B[oq];W[op];B[mq];W[om]LB[pm:a]C[B60: Pros thinks unanimously White should simply extend at 'a', Black's group on the right side wouldn't die but will live very painfully. Gu Li analyzed, if White extends at 'a', White's situation is favorable.]
;B[pl];W[ol];B[rp];W[rq];B[so];W[mg]C[W66 is unexpected. The play of W60 and W66 is too soft.];B[id];W[jd];B[je]LB[nc:a]C[Gu Li thinks, the order of B67 and B69 is questionable. Black should first cut at 'a' to probe White.];W[kd]LB[nc:a][hd:b][nd:c][mc:d][md:e][mb:f][ma:g]C[After the exchange, Black's cut at 'a' is already not working, since White can cut at 'b' and generate numerous ko threats by initiating the ko with W 'c' to W 'g'. Furthermore, Black's corner is also not alive. So Black misses this chance.]

;W[bb];B[af];W[ae];B[cb];W[ba];B[ie];W[md];B[lf];W[lg];B[nf];W[ng];B[bh]C[Starting from B95, it seems Peng Quan completely controls game tempo.];W[ei]
;B[gi];W[ca];B[da];W[eb];B[db]C[After W100, Gu Li thinks Black is favorable.];W[kf];B[re];W[ek];B[fj];W[ej];B[dl];W[qr];B[hs]
;W[gs];B[is];W[fr];B[jh];W[kp];B[jp];W[gb]C[W116 is the losing move of this game. White clearly miscalculated. Black's aji is very "bad", but there is no loop hole here.];B[ha];W[ed];B[ee];W[hd];B[gd];W[jg]
;B[ih];W[fh];B[gh];W[fd];B[dd];W[kh]C[However, up to W128, White concedes the game, it is very surprising, the board is still very broad.];B[he]C[Peng Quan won three consecutive games.])
