(;SZ[19]DT[2001-11-06]EV[6th Samsung Cup semi final game 1]PC[Korea]KM[6.5]PB[Lee Changho]BR[9p]PW[Chang Hao]WR[9p]RE[W+0.5]C[Copyright by gogameworld.com and weiqi.tom.com.];B[pd]C[Lee Changho 9p of Korea is Black.

Before this game, Chang Hao has played a total of 16 games with Lee Changho but is trailing by a large margin 2:14.
];W[dc]C[Chang Hao 9p of China is White.];B[qp];W[dq]C[The opening of W2 and W4 is Go Seigen's favorite when he was in his prime period.]
;B[oq]C[The opening of the star and the worry-free corner with B1, B3 and B5 is very steady, it seems that today Lee Changho will practice "Tai Chi" (a marathon game) in a big time.];W[qj]C[The splitting move of W6 is a good move, breaking up the territorial framework.];B[do];W[co];B[cn];W[cp]C[White elects to obtain territory with W8 and W10, which should be Chang Hao's strategy for today.];B[de];W[ce];B[cf];W[cd]C[White continues to take territory fiercely with W12 and W14.];B[df]
;W[fc];B[dn];W[fq];B[dj]C[B19 is a good point for three-space extensions on both the upper and lower side, Black can be satisfied; White has occupied two big corners and obtained sente, White can also be satisfied. Later on, the key point for the game is how White contains Black's influential development in the center.];W[qg]LB[qm:a][qe:b][nc:c][nd:d][md:e][ne:f][lc:g][oc:h]C[The two-space extension at 20 is a good point. The extension at 'a' is also a good point, which can restrict the development of Black's worry-free corner, W20 puts pressure on Black's star stone in the upper right corner. In the first 20 moves, both sides are very careful, Lee Changho is pondering. Right now the following variation is possible, B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f', W 'g', B 'h' and W 'a' (see var a).]

(;B[nc]LB[rd:a][mc:b][qc:c][qd:d][pc:e][od:f][ob:g][ql:h][nd:i][md:j][lc:k][me:l]C[After the knight's move of B21, White is left with the good point at 'a'. If Black plays the large knight's move at 'b', it is no good, White would enter the corner at 'c', followed by B 'd', W 'e', B 'f', White can make life in the corner by playing at 'g', if Black attacks White's two stones at 'h', White can play at 21, then B 'i', W 'j', B 'k' and W 'l', White can fight (see var b).];W[rp]C[The probe move of W22 is a common tactic for dealing with Black's worry-free corner.]

(;B[ro]LB[qo:a][rq:b][qn:c][pn:d][qm:e]C[B23: If Black retreats to 'a', then W23, B 'b', W 'c', B 'd' and W 'e', White's shape is not bad, Black can't be satisfied (see var a).];W[qo];B[po];W[qn];B[rn];W[qm];B[rm];W[ql]
;B[qq]C[Through 31, Black has gained a big profit in the lower right corner, White has also strengthened his right side, the territory for both sides keeps in the balance, because White has grabbed two big corners in the beginning.];W[bh]LB[dh:a][bf:b]C[W32 looks like a "depth bomb", White can advance at 'a' and retreat at 'b'.];B[bg];W[dh];B[eh]LB[ck:a][dk:b][cl:c][dl:d][ci:e][di:f][bm:g][bn:h][cj:i]C[After B35, if W 'a', B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f', W 'g', B 'h', White can live (see var a), but it is hard to judge losses and gains, Black becomes very thick and White's two corners on the left side would all incur losses.]

(;W[ck]C[Lee Changho is in deep meditation.];B[dk]LB[eg:a][ch:b][ci:c][dg:d][cg:e][di:f][bf:g][ei:h][fh:i]C[Chang Hao is pondering. Now if W 'a', then B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f', W 'b' and B 'g', then White would get captured; Moreover when W 'a', if Black directly plays at 'd', then W 'h', B 'b', W 'i' and B 'c', White makes a ponnuki in the center, Black is no good (see var b).]
(;W[bl];B[bm];W[dl];B[el];W[cj];B[di];W[ci];B[dm];W[cl];B[fk];W[bo]C[W48: Before making two eyes, White first makes a forcing move.];B[hc];W[fm]
;B[em];W[gd]LB[hd:a][ge:b][fg:c][md:d]C[If next Black plays at 'a', then W 'b', Black needs to reinforce at 'c', White can play the good reduction move at 'd'.];B[ie];W[he]LB[id:a][ei:b][dg:c][ch:d][fh:e][fj:f][ek:g][gj:h]C[B55: If Black retreats to 'a', then W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 'e', W 'f', B 'f' and W 'h', Black is no good.]

(;B[ed];W[ec];B[bn];W[bj];B[id]LB[ei:a][dg:b][ch:c][fi:d][eg:e][fh:f][fg:g][gg:h][ff:i][gf:j][fe:k][pf:l]C[B59: Black has the implication of sacrificing some stones, if White plays at 'a', then B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f', W 'g', B 'h', W 'i', B 'j', W 'k' and B 'l', Black's outside influence is overwhelming, the potential of making territory can't be underestimated (see var a). 

After this move, it is time for noon break.]

(;W[eg];B[dg];W[ch];B[fg];W[ei];B[fh];W[fj]LB[ek:a]C[W66 is a tesuji, aiming at the snap-back at 'a'.];B[fi];W[ej];B[ek];W[gj];B[hl]C[Through 71, it leads to a complicated fight in the center.]

After W72, for Black to attach and cut immediately at 'b' is not working, followed by W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f', W 'g', B 'h', W 'i', B 'j', W 'k', B 'l', W 'a', B 'm', W 'n', B 'o' and W 'p', Black is no good (see var a). Through 72, White is not in an inferior position.]

(;B[ih];W[hk];B[il];W[jl]LB[jm:a][jk:b][in:c][hi:d]C[Lee Changho is pondering again. Now if Black hanes at 'a', it would lead to the variation of W 'b', B 'c' and W 'd', Black would be separated into two groups and is no good. If Black directly cuts at 'b', the variation is very complicated.];B[gk];W[hi];B[hh];W[jk];B[in]
;W[jn];B[ep]LB[fo:a][fp:b][eq:c]C[B83 is a sequence play, otherwise White has the tactic of jumping to 'a' later on, if Black plays at 83, then White can connects at 'b', the push and cut at 'c' is not working.];W[eq];B[jo];W[jm]
(;B[ho]LB[io:a][im:b][hm:c][hn:d][gn:e]C[B87: Black can't connect at 'a', otherwise if W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 'e' and W87, Black is no good (see var a). So far White in the center becomes very thick, most pros in the observing room think White is no bad.];W[if]LB[jf:a][jg:b][ig:c][hf:d][kf:e][kg:f]C[W88: White tangles with Black tightly, if B 'a', then W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 'e' and W 'f', Black has no assurance of success.]

(;B[ke];W[je];B[jd];W[le];B[kc]LB[ld:a]C[W96: For White to capture in a ladder is the proper move, if White plays at 'a', then White would press at 96, White is unreasonable.];W[kf];B[lc];W[ko];B[kp];W[lo];B[kh]C[Now it is the crucial time, Chang Hao is still tardy to play his next stone.]
;W[mg]LB[mh:a][nh:b][lg:c][mf:d][mi:e][ni:f][mj:g][jp:h][io:i][kq:j][gp:k][rd:l]C[After White reinforces with W104, Lee Changho is also pondering. Now the game should be to White's advantage, if B 'a', then W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 'e', W 'f', B 'g', W 'h', B 'i', W 'j', Black still needs to strengthen at 'k', White can grab the big endgame at 'l' (see var a).]
(;B[gp]C[B105 is a surprising move, it seems that Lee Changho puts more importance on the lower side, B105 itself is also worth more than 20 points.];W[rd]C[Although sealing off the center territory is also very big, but W106 is indeed an eye-catching big endgame.];B[lg]C[B107 is an unusual maneuver, Lee Changho obviously feels that the game is not to his advantage.];W[mf];B[mh];W[li];B[lh];W[og]LB[jh:a]C[After W112, Black's weak point at 'a' looks noticeable.];B[nh];W[qc]
