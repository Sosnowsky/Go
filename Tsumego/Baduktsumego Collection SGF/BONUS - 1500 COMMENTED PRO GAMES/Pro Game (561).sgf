Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[The 18th Asian TV Cup ended on 8/11, Wang Xi 5p defeated Lee Changho 9p by resignation in the final, winning the champion of this event for the first time.];W[pp];B[dc];W[cp];B[ep]
;W[de];B[dn];W[cc];B[bo]LB[ci:a][di:b]C[B9: Black can also consider to make extension at 'a' or 'b'.];W[ci];B[cg]LB[er:a][dd:b][ec:c][cb:d]C[B11 invading directly is rarely seen, the common move is to jump at 'a', next W 'b', B 'c' and W 'd'. Lee Changho once played this way against Zhou Heyang in Asian Team Competition, in that game Lee Changho lost, so this is perhaps his study result.];W[dd]
;B[ec]C[But in terms of result, Lee Changho's new move is not successful.];W[bd];B[hc];W[dh];B[er];W[jc]C[W18: White forces and puts emphasis on attack.];B[oc]LB[he:a][od:b]C[B19: If Black jumps to 'a' normally, White will approach at 19 and 'b', Black is a little dissatisfied.];W[ie];B[he];W[hf]
;B[ge];W[gf];B[ff];W[if];B[ef]LB[fg:a][dg:b][fd:c]C[B27: For Black to directly extend at 'a' is better, this way White will cap at 'b', this result is better than the real game. In the game, Lee Changho must have ignored White's tactic at 'c'.];W[df];B[fh];W[eh];B[qn]LB[lc:a][fd:b]C[B31: For Black to extend at 'a' and tie up White is better, this also indirectly reinforces big group's hidden trouble, but again it is still the same problem, Lee Changho didn't notice White's tactic at 'b'.]
;W[nq];B[qj];W[mc];B[rp];W[kq];B[iq];W[rd];B[re];W[qq];B[pl];W[fd]LB[ed:a][hd:b]C[The strike of W42 is severe! Hitting Black's vital point. If Black plays counter-push at 'a', White will wedge at 'b', Black suddenly has no way to  handle the situation.]
;B[fe];W[fc];B[ed];W[gb]C[In the game, Black tolerates painfully and allows White to connect with W42, W44 and W46, however Black itself doesn't have even one eye for the big group, Black becomes too heavy and incurs a big loss!];B[ee];W[hb]C[Here, Black incurs loss of more than one move and is close to collapse.];B[dg];W[eg];B[fg];W[fi];B[hh];W[gi]

;W[db];B[eb];W[qi]LB[ca:a]C[W70: For Black to take B63 is perhaps better, this way Black's big group is not alive, eventually it will be Black's heavy burden.];B[da];W[ba]LB[db:a][ca:b]C[In the game, Wang Xi perhaps feels here the value is not big, even if Black takes one stone with B71, later on White still can play atari at 'b', Black's whole group is ko-living.];B[pj];W[qe]C[White's sequence following W74 is very brilliant, just with a few moves, White destroys Black's side territory.];B[pe];W[qf]
;B[rf];W[qg];B[qc];W[pd];B[pc];W[rg];B[rc];W[ng]C[Through W84, White's advantage becomes obvious.];B[be];W[ad];B[mb];W[lc];B[rq]
;W[fq]LB[eq:a]C[When White strikes with W90, with B91 Black almost loses common sense. Black certainly should connect at 'a', this way Black's situation is not good, but Black still can continue, the play in the game leads to Black's quick defeat.];B[lr]C[Perhaps Lee Changho feels his situation is already not optimistic, with B91 he wants to make the last-ditch effort.];W[eq]C[But White push-and-cuts with W92.];B[dq];W[dp];B[cq];W[eo]C[After White makes ponnuki with W94 and W96, Black's situation has deteriorated further.];B[bp];W[lq];B[kr]
;W[mr];B[fr];W[fp];B[ej];W[dk];B[bj];W[ch]C[When B103 and B105, W104 and W106 are all good moves, White doesn't give Black any chance to borrow strength.];B[jq];W[gr]C[W108 is strong! In a favorable situation, White is not soft-hearted at all and continues to chase and attack fiercely. Black unexpectedly can't do nothing about it!];B[cd];W[ce];B[go]C[Following B111, Black tries all he can to kill White's big group in order to have a chance to win, but this task clearly can't be accomplished.]
