;W[pb];B[cf];W[fd];B[qc];W[kc];B[bd];W[cc];B[dh];W[em];B[mq];W[ne]C[The opening is steady, with W30 White normally will play on the right side.];B[pi];W[qk]
;B[qi];W[qn];B[rn]LB[ro:a]C[Both sides' moves are very solid, guess they will fight hard in the second half of the game, now White wants to play at 'a'.];W[ro]C[Black perhaps will atari then crawl at the top, the variation is complicated.];B[rp];W[po];B[so];W[qp];B[ro];W[lo]C[Now White can be satisfied.];B[iq]C[B43 is a strong move and sharp, perhaps Black gains a little profit.]
;W[ir];B[ip];W[jr];B[hp];W[gq];B[hl];W[fh];B[hi]C[B51 is unconstrained, but Black seems a little thin.];W[fj]C[W52: White elects to play softly, now the game seems to be a long one, in this area White perhaps misses a chance to fight.];B[jl];W[ll];B[jd]
;W[jc];B[hg];W[id];B[pn];W[oo];B[on];W[no];B[pp]C[Now in terms of territory, Black is leading slightly, the situation is still very long, how to set pattern in the middle is the key.];W[ol];B[qm];W[kj]C[W66 attacking strongly is a good move.];B[gj]LB[bc:a]C[Black's sequence following B67 is a painstaking way to set the pattern, now if White strengthens the center, then B 'a', it will be a close game. now White seems to have some tactic to pound at Black on the left side.]

;B[jo];W[ch]C[W82 is intense, the fight over here will directly impact the outcome of this game.];B[ci];W[cg];B[dg];W[bi];B[de];W[cj];B[di];W[bh]LB[mj:a]C[White obtains sente and plays at 'a', White is favorable in the game.];B[ee]
;W[ed];B[bf];W[cl];B[bm];W[gf]C[W96: White makes himself thick to take control of the situation, it is a play in a favorable situation, Lee Changho perhaps thinks the two stones in the center are not big, to enclose each other's territory should be good enough, but if White loses the game, W96 could be the losing move.];B[bc];W[bb];B[cd];W[cb];B[dj];W[dk];B[fe];W[ge]
;B[bj];W[ck];B[mj];W[lj];B[gp];W[fr];B[nf];W[mi];B[ie]C[Black sees there is little chance to win the game if playing endgame normally, so Black attaches with B111 and tangles with B113, this kind of endgame is much more complicated.];W[je];B[oe];W[ij];B[gk]
;W[od];B[me];W[nd];B[of];W[if];B[pc];W[gm];B[hm];W[gl];B[hk]C[Black obtains the precious sente by probing with B113, the situation becomes closer.];W[gi];B[fg];W[ob]
;B[nj];W[mk];B[lr];W[ff];B[ef]C[So far, it seems to be a half-point game.];W[gg];B[lg];W[lh];B[kg];W[jk];B[jm];W[pk];B[ld]
;W[lc];B[rj];W[qb];B[rb];W[ra];B[rc];W[lq];B[nr];W[hn];B[in];W[ac]C[In this game, the first half is relatively steady, in the middle game, White scores on the left side, W96 is not simple and clear, Wang Xi grabs this subtle chance, the game-deciding moves of B111 and B113 are successful, and Black doesn't make any mistake in the endgame, so far Black perhaps can win the game by a small margin.];B[ad];W[eg]
;B[bg];W[bk];B[ag];W[oi];B[oh];W[ni];B[rk];W[gn]LB[fp:a][hj:b]C[W164 is a surprisingly big move, the earlier judgment is questionable, after W164, there come two endgame 'a' and 'b'.];B[ig];W[jg];B[jh]
