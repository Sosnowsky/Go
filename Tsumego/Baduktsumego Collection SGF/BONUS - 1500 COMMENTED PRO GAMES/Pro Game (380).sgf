Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[pd]C[In the final of the 48th Korean Guksu loser's group, Yoo Changhyeok 9p took Black and defeated Yun Junsang 3p by resignation, getting to the challenger final. In the middle of this game, Yoo's Black already shows a collapsing shape, but in the second half, he tried his best to make the game complicated, and turned the game around in the end.];W[dd];B[pq];W[dq];B[co]
;W[ep];B[jq];W[qn];B[qp];W[qk];B[ck];W[hq];B[qi];W[on];B[pm];W[pn];B[mp];W[ok]C[The opening up to W18 is very steady, but White seems a little slow.]
;B[qf]TR[qi]LB[cf:a]C[B19: Black should first consider to approach the corner at 'a', treating B13 (the marked stone) lightly.];W[cm];B[bm]LB[eo:a]C[As to the invasion of W20, White obtains a bit territory with the sequence from B21 to W30, White has nothing to complain. However, since White already strengthens with W12 earlier, with B21 for Black to fight by attaching out at 'a' is a little far-fetched.];W[bn];B[cn];W[bl];B[dm];W[cl];B[dl]
;W[bo];B[dk];W[en];B[bk];W[am];B[cf]C[The corner-approach of B33 is inevitable.];W[fc];B[bd];W[ic]C[White makes extensions casually with W34 and W36, so far the game seems to be a long and close one.];B[kc];W[cc]LB[ob:a][pb:b][pc:c][nc:d]C[After Black expands his moyo at the maximum limit with B37, W38 is slow, now White should play at 'a', White also can immediately invade at 'b', 'c' or 'd'.]
;B[ke]LB[oc:a]C[B39 is an overplay! The original move is to strengthen with the diagonal extension at 'a', Black can be satisfied, in the real game, White gets to enter the corner, Black can't kill White, if initiating a ko, the ko will be lighter for White and heavier for Black, Black is not favorable.];W[qc];B[ob];W[pb];B[pc];W[rb];B[rd]LB[pa:a][ne:b][oe:c][mb:d]C[Because Black can't atari and initiate a ko at 'a', Black is already very hard to play, but B45 trying to kill strongly is clearly miscalculation, Black perhaps overlooks that when Black plays hane at 'b', White can cut at 'c' in sente and then hane down at 'd', Black's two stones will get captured, however, this is also a common shape, surprisingly Yoo Changhyeok forgot about this, his recent state really starts to worry us.]

;B[lb];W[ma];B[me];W[ld];B[le];W[oa];B[kd];W[na]C[Through W66, White is clearly favorable for the game.];B[nl]C[As to Black's desperate sequence following B67, White's play is indeed below the standard.];W[op]LB[ro:a]C[First, with W68 for White to play at 'a' is the most simplistic and clear play, strengthening himself and grabbing endgame points.];B[oq]
;W[nk];B[rl];W[qm];B[rk];W[ml]LB[np:a]C[Next, with W74, White doesn't elect to bump at 'a', it is really inexplicable.];B[ql];W[pl];B[nm];W[mo];B[mm];W[om];B[lo]
;W[np];B[mq];W[nq];B[nr];W[mn];B[ll];W[ln];B[mk];W[ni];B[li];W[ko]LB[ef:a]C[W92 is also unnecessary, certainly White should first grab the vital knight's point at 'a'.];B[ef]
;W[il]LB[he:a]C[W94: White still should fly slowly into the middle at 'a', of course, even with the play in the real game, it is still to White's advantage.];B[jm];W[im];B[jn];W[pp];B[rq];W[jl];B[km];W[in];B[jo];W[ip];B[jp]
;W[ol]C[With the play of W106, White is too painful!];B[dn];W[cp];B[gl];W[hk]LB[fm:a]C[White's losing move is W110, White certainly should make the diagonal extension at 'a'.];B[io];W[gm];B[gp]C[In the game, Black breaks through in sente with B111 and B113, the outcome of the game is already unclear.
