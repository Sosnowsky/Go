;W[cf];B[nc];W[qn];B[qp];W[qk];B[qi];W[co]LB[on:a][mq:b]C[W12: For White to jump at 'a' and exchange with B 'b' is common sense.];B[id];W[jq]C[But with W12 and W14, White insists not to do territory-damaging exchange, this fits Ma's 9p style.
];B[pm]
;W[ok]LB[qm:a][pk:b]C[W16: White jumps lightly to take the whole game into account. If White answers at 'a', then Black will seal off at 'b'.];B[qm];W[om];B[pn];W[oh];B[qg];W[ke]LB[mk:a][kc:b][ie:c]C[W22: For White to strengthen at 'a' is common sense. In the game, White expects Black to answer at 'b', then White can press at 'c', forming thickness at the top, this will also reinforce White's defect on the right side and White can save one move.]
;B[jf]C[B23: Black certainly sees through White's plan.];W[kc];B[kf];W[md];B[oj]C[Through B25, Black obtains sente and successfully gets to attach with B27, Black takes initiative.];W[nk]LB[nj:a][ni:b]C[W28: If White plays hane at 'a', then Black will play double hane at 'b'.
];B[jc];W[mf];B[pj];W[ql]
;B[nj];W[oe];B[pd];W[jd];B[ic]C[In order to make life, White has to conduct damaging exchange of W36 and B37.];W[lf]C[Through W38, White lives painfully, Black appears vivid on the board.
];B[cc];W[dc];B[db];W[eb]C[The hane of W42 is far-fetched.];B[cb];W[ec]
;B[be];W[fd];B[ce];W[de];B[df];W[ff];B[dg]C[Through B51, Black's profit is huge.]
(;W[gc]LB[ie:a][je:b][kd:c][he:d][if:e][ig:f][hf:g][gf:h][hg:i][gg:j][hh:k][gd:l]C[W52: White can only hane out at 'a', to seek balance in territory. However Black can atari at 'b', then W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f', W 'g', B 'h', W 'i', B 'j', W 'k' and B 'l', Black also can adequately fight (see var a).];B[kb]
;W[mc];B[lc];W[oc]LB[ld:a][dr:b]C[W46: Originally White wants very much to initiate the ko at 'a', but Black can be satisfied by attaching at 'b' as ko threat, White is unreasonable.];B[mb];W[nb];B[ld];W[ma];B[lb];W[pb];B[qb];W[od]
;B[me];W[nd];B[le];W[qf];B[rf];W[qe]LB[pf:a][re:b][pg:c][rh:d]C[W70: At any rate, White should retreat at 'a', after B 'b', W 'c' and B 'd', White can take tenuki and play somewhere else.];B[re];W[pg];B[ph]
;W[rh];B[rg]LB[og:a][ng:b][pf:c][pe:d]C[However, with B75, Black should immediately atari at 'a', next W 'b', B 'c' and W 'd', this way Black can obtain sente.

In this local variation, both sides have played one questionable move. Through B75, local gain and loss is about even, but since Black obtains some profit in the upper left corner and doesn't pay any price, so overall Black is favorable for the game.];W[rm];B[rn];W[on]LB[po:a]C[W76 and W78 are good moves! Black is difficult.

If Black answers at 'a', White already takes advantage.];B[rl];W[np]LB[nm:a]C[In the game, White gets to settle down. In retrospect, Black should find a chance (for example when playing B63) to exchange B78 and W 'a' as early as possible.]
;B[dr]C[The attachment of B81 is a common tactic to counter worry-free corner. Now how White to answer is a difficult problem.];W[er];B[eq];W[ep];B[fq];W[fr];B[fp];W[gq]LB[dp:a]C[W88: In the real game, I worried White's connection at 'a', that way I feel Black is difficult to play.];B[gp];W[hq];B[dp]
;W[cq];B[eo];W[do];B[em]C[Through B95, Black is able to settle the shape simply and keeps advantage, White is not satisfied.];W[ci];B[ch];W[in];B[nr]LB[mr:a][or:b]C[W98 and B99 are miai good points.

After B99, White can't attach at either 'a' or 'b', locally White already has no good answer.];W[cl];B[hm]
;W[im];B[hl];W[hn];B[gn];W[il];B[hk];W[lk]LB[bh:a][bg:b][dh:c]C[W108: White should first hane at 'a', Black can only block at 'b', White can atari at 'c', next W108, this variation is better than the real game.];B[mq];W[mp];B[kq]
;W[kp];B[lp];W[lo];B[lq];W[jp];B[bi]C[The hane of B117 is huge! So far, all shapes are already settled, Black is leading about 10 points in territory and Black is also very thick on the board, the outcome of the game is already decided.

No comments afterwards.];W[rk];B[og];W[ng];B[pf];W[pe];B[rc];W[sl]
