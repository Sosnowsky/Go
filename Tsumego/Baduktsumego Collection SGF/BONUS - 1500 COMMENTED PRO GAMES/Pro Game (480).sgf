(;W[dn]LB[fp:a][gp:b][gq:c][cq:d][eq:e][cp:f]TR[kq]C[W10: If White attaches at 'a', then it would lead to the normal variation with B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e' and B 'f', this way the position of the marked white stone is not good (see var a).];B[dm];W[en];B[cp]LB[cq:a][co:b]C[If B13 at 'a', then W 'b', Black is no good.]
;W[cq];B[co];W[dq];B[cl];W[gp]C[Through W18, the local variation is common.];B[cf];W[fc];B[bd];W[cc];B[dh];W[nc];B[qf];W[pb]
;B[qc];W[kc];B[mq]C[Through B29, the moves from both sides are very steady, all emphasizing to grab territory.];W[qn]C[W30: White elects to attach since there is already no good position to play splitting move on the right side.];B[pn];W[qm];B[ro];W[pm];B[qi]C[B35 is a good move, Black clearly adopts a territory-oriented strategy.];W[on];B[po];W[pj]
;B[qj];W[pi]C[After White presses with W40, Cho Hunhyun has used a lot of time thinking of this local variation.];B[ph];W[oh];B[pg];W[pk]C[Through W44, White obtains some certain outside influence, but Black gains sente and has nothing to complain.];B[jq]C[B45: Black seeks a chance of fighting.];W[jr]LB[jp:a][iq:b]C[W46 is the original move, if White plays hane at 'a', then B 'b', White is no good.];B[jp]
;W[ir]C[W48 is a thick move.];B[nm];W[om];B[em]LB[dk:a]C[B51 is the vital point for both sides' moyo, it also aims to prevent White from striking at 'a'.];W[fm];B[fn]C[B53 is an asking move.];W[fo];B[nk]C[With the sequence following B55, Black starts to reduce White's influence.];W[mj];B[kl]
;W[fl]C[The extension of W58 is very powerful.];B[hm];W[dk];B[cj];W[eh];B[di]C[Through B63, White can be satisfied.];W[kj]C[W64 is a mutual good point.];B[gn]C[B65 is an inevitable counterattack.];W[hk];B[gk];W[gj]C[W68 fighting by sacrifice is a bold conception.]
;B[fk];W[fj];B[gl];W[ef]C[Through W72, although White's moyo is big, but Black becomes very thick after capturing two white stones, the situation is still not clear.];B[nh]C[B73: Black seeks a breakthrough here.];W[nj];B[oi];W[kf]C[W76: White takes tenuki to enclose territory, but there is still some room left for invasion.];B[md]C[The reduction following B77 is inevitable.];W[mc];B[kh]
;W[mh];B[kd];W[jd];B[ld];W[jc];B[lg]C[Through B85, White temporarily doesn't have any good attack maneuver.];W[ej]C[W86 is a huge move, Black is not comfortable.];B[je];W[ie];B[ij]C[The play of B89 is worth study.];W[ll]C[The counterattack of W90 is very intense.]
