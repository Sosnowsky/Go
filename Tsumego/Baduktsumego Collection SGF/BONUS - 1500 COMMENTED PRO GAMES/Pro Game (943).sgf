;B[dq];W[cm]TR[de][cf]C[In the game, through W18, White has incurred a loss locally, but because the marked two black stones are also damaged, overall the situation is still even.];B[qh];W[qn];B[ql]
(;W[rl]LB[on:a][nq:b][pk:c][rp:d][pl:e]C[The attachment of W22 is strong, if jumping to 'a', then B 'b', W 'c', B 'd' and W 'e', Black's territory is substantial (see var a).];B[rm];W[qm];B[rk];W[pl];B[qk];W[pk];B[rj]

(;B[gq]LB[eq:a][ep:b][gp:c]C[Black has no choice but to hane outside with B41, if Black hits at 'a', then W41, B 'b', W 'c', Black is still not alive but White already gains a lot of points, Black can't tolerate (see var a).];W[eq];B[ep];W[gr];B[hq];W[dr];B[hr];W[cr];B[fr];W[er]
;B[gs];W[go];B[gp];W[bq]C[Through W54, White has gained a lot.];B[mi];W[jd];B[ld]C[B55 and B57: Black concentrates on developing the right side.];W[df];B[hd]LB[lf:a]C[However B59 is an overplay, the original move is to jump at 'a', completely enclosing the right side, if all the right becomes territory, it would be close to 80 points, this way White must enclose a huge territory on the left side, White's burden is heavy.];W[jf];B[hf]
;W[lf]C[In the game, being jumped by W62, Black is very painful!];B[ih];W[lh]LB[nf:a]C[However, W64 is not good either, White should directly jump to 'a'.];B[ng];W[nf];B[mg];W[mf];B[lc];W[nd];B[nc];W[pd]
;B[pc]LB[pe:a]C[The block of B73 is slow! Black should hane at 'a', which is clearly better than the play in the game.];W[qe];B[od];W[og];B[oh];W[oe];B[pg];W[jh];B[ii];W[pf];B[qf];W[li]
;B[of];W[pe];B[re]C[With B85 and B87, Black elects to play the ko with White, which is the losing cause in this game.];W[og];B[op];W[rd];B[oq]LB[or:a]C[Because the ko threat of B89 is not that particularly severe, Black has used three moves of B89, B91 and B 'a', White is still left with ko-living in the corner.];W[ro];B[qo];W[qp];B[po]
;W[qc]C[After White takes with W96, White has not only gained a lot of points, and also White becomes thick on the whole board, Black has already completely sunk into an inferior situation.];B[jc];W[io];B[cg];W[ee];B[dg];W[ef];B[or];W[jp];B[jr];W[sn];B[sl];W[ic]
