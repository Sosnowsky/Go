Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[pd]C[In this key match, Hu Yaoyu, who was leading in the first half, made several mistakes at crucial points and lost the game pitifully.];W[dd];B[qp];W[dp];B[oq]
;W[qj];B[ql];W[qf];B[mc]C[From the beginning, both sides elect to play steadily and want to decide the game in endgame.];W[rd]LB[qc:a]C[W10: White can also elect to take corner territory at 'a'.];B[qh];W[of]LB[pi:a]C[Next with B13 Black can also elect to make diagonal at 'a'.];B[qc]C[They make compromise in the game.];W[pi]C[So far, it looks like a steady opening.]
;B[fq];W[dn];B[dr];W[cq];B[hp]LB[jq:a][iq:b]C[B19 is positive play, but at this situation B19 is too far from the lower-right worry-free corner, leaving White the good invasion point at 'a', so Black more wants to make two-space extension at 'b'.];W[cj];B[fc];W[eb];B[jc]C[B21 and B23: Black's tempo is smooth.];W[jq]C[And White very easily gets to invade with W24.]
;B[iq];W[jp];B[hn];W[mq]C[Through W28, White is very happy.];B[rc];W[ph]C[The exchange of B29 and W30 is a little weird, here Black doesn't want White become thick.];B[dm]C[After the attachment of B31, White's counterattack is inevitable.];W[em];B[dl];W[cn];B[be];W[bc]
;B[ch]C[B35 and B37 are light moves to turn body around, just escaping two stones is not interesting.];W[ej];B[eh]LB[de:a][ed:b]C[But next the jump of B39 is mistake! At any rate, Black should first attach at 'a', after W 'b', then B39, it makes a huge difference from the real game.];W[el];B[bj];W[bk];B[ci];W[dk];B[cr];W[df]C[B46 is good move, Black is very painful.]
;B[cf];W[fb];B[rk];W[rj];B[nq];W[mp];B[no]C[B51 and B53 defending side territory is imperative.];W[ol];B[pm];W[kd];B[kc];W[md];B[nc]
;W[dg]LB[ei:a][bi:b]C[But the extension of W60 is also very severe. If Black doubles up at 'a', White will capture one stone at 'b', Black is more painful.];B[bd];W[cc];B[aj];W[ah];B[ak];W[bl];B[bi];W[bg];B[cg];W[dh]
;B[di];W[ei];B[de];W[ee];B[ce];W[ff]C[Through W76, White builds thickness with some points, Black didn't get any point. So far, White is favorable.];B[ie];W[ad];B[af];W[hc];B[ne];W[lf];B[ic]

;B[hs];W[js];B[gr];W[mr]LB[ln:a]C[The connection of W100 is very big, but to make knight at 'a' is more solid, White is easier to control.];B[nf];W[ng];B[mg];W[mf];B[mo]C[The attachment of B105 is good and calm move, here Lee Changho starts to show his talent.];W[qe]LB[mh:a]C[W106: White fights very ferociously, to capture at 'a' in ladder is original move.]
;B[lo];W[lp];B[nh];W[og];B[nj]C[B111 is good move, Black starts to counterattack.];W[pl];B[lg];W[kg];B[kh];W[jg]LB[kf:a]C[W116: For White to connect at 'a' is stronger.];B[me]C[After Black pushes with B117, White is very painful!]
;W[kf];B[ji];W[ii];B[ij];W[hi]LB[ih:a]C[The extension of W122 is mistake, White should retreat at 'a', this way White is still a little favorable.];B[hg]C[The strike of W123 is sharp!];W[ac];B[ae];W[hf];B[if];W[ig]
;B[gf]C[B129: White has no answer.];W[ag];B[fg];W[ef];B[bh];W[kj]C[After such a big hit, Hu Yaoyu is a little hasty, in fact if playing endgame steadily, it is still a close game.];B[jj];W[lh]C[W134 and W136: White fights desperately.];B[mh];W[li];B[mk]C[In this crucial game-deciding point, Lee Changho plays perfectly.]
;W[lk];B[ll];W[jk];B[ki]C[The squeezing move of B143 is good move.];W[ml];B[mi];W[lj];B[kl];W[kk];B[il];W[ik];B[hk]C[Next Black fights by sacrificing.]
;W[hj];B[jl];W[jh];B[ns]C[Black kills White with the hane of B155, the game is suddenly over.];W[ko];B[jo];W[io];B[jn];W[mm];B[kn];W[br];B[on];W[ge]
