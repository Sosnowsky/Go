Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[pd]C[In the semi final game 3, since my careless play in the middle game, my situation was once on the verge of collapse, luckily I stayed calm and found the clever move of W138 to get me out of trouble.];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[fc]
;W[cf];B[db];W[cc];B[ic];W[po];B[qm];W[qq];B[qp];W[pp];B[qo];W[qn];B[pn]LB[rn:a][oq:b][rm:c][pr:d][pf:e]TR[qm]C[B17: Black can consider to atari at 'a', if White connects at 17, Black can extend at 'b', since White is not favorable in the ladder, White can't cut at 'c' to capture the marked black stone, Black can fight. If White ataris at 'b', Black can take at 17, White takes at 'd', Black is sente, next for Black to protect the corner at 'e' is very big.]
;W[rn];B[rq];W[qr];B[ro];W[oq];B[rm];W[on];B[pm];W[jd]C[The shoulder-hit of W26 is a good point!];B[jc];W[kd];B[he];W[jf]LB[gd:a]C[After the jump of W30, White is left with the tactic of playing at 'a'.]
;B[fq];W[cn];B[iq];W[qf];B[qe];W[pf];B[nc];W[ne];B[rf];W[rg];B[re]C[The sequence from B35 to B41 is very practical, showing Korean players' territory-oriented style.];W[dj];B[hg]
;W[gd]LB[kc:a]C[W44: White can also turn at 'a'.];B[gc];W[hd];B[id];W[ie];B[if];W[je];B[ee];W[ge];B[hf];W[ff];B[ed]

(;W[eh]LB[kh:a][df:b][dg:c][eg:d][gf:e][fg:f][fe:g][er:h]C[W60: For White to make the knight's move at 'a' perhaps is better, next B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W60, B 'e', W 'f', B 'g' and W 'h' (see var a).];B[kh];W[mg];B[kc];W[lc];B[lb]
;W[jg];B[jh];W[mi];B[jk];W[er];B[lq];W[fr];B[oi];W[le];B[md];W[od];B[oc];W[pe]LB[ph:a]C[The sequence from W74 to W78 should be reserved, simply jumping at 'a' is the vital point for fixing the shape.]
;B[qc];W[qh];B[cm]C[The attachment of B81 is a game-deciding move! Otherwise komi will become Black's burden.];W[dm];B[dn];W[en];B[dl];W[do];B[em]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.];W[fm];B[dn];W[hc]
;B[hb];W[dm];B[nr]LB[me:a]C[The knight's move of B91 is not appropriate, with this ko threat, Black most likely can't play somewhere else, Black should find ko threats by pushing at 'a'.];W[mp];B[lp];W[lo];B[mo];W[mn];B[no];W[np]LB[nn:a]C[W100: White can also connect at 'a'.]
;B[ln];W[ko];B[nn];W[nm];B[mm];W[oo];B[mn];W[om];B[ml];W[ok]C[Through W110, it is not to Black's advantage.];B[dn];W[ib];B[jb]
;W[dm];B[lg];W[el]LB[me:a][dn:b][io:c]C[White is very happy to eliminate the ko by W116, but it is a little premature, to answer the ko threat at 'a' is more steady, followed by B 'b' and W 'c', Black is very painful.
];B[pj]LB[me:a][rr:b]C[B117: I thought Black only tried to push and capture White's several stones and didn't expect the opponent had other purposes, White's turn at 'b' almost helps to achieve this purpose!];W[rr]LB[oj:a][nj:b][me:c]C[If I lost this game, W118 would be the losing move! With W118 White certainly should squeeze at 'a' or make connection by the diagonal at 'b', this way Black can only push and capture White's several stones at 'c'.]
;B[og]C[The jump of B119 is severe! Young Korean players are very sharp in these places!];W[lh]LB[sp:a]C[White sinks into a difficult situation, but with W120 White can only play at 'a', this way at least not all white stones will get captured, in the game Black plays the double hane of B121, White completely despairs! After Black connects with B123, White has lost half move over here.];B[mf];W[sp];B[me];W[rj];B[qj]LB[pk:a]C[B125 is a bad move! Black can only attach at 'a', White already has no good follow-up maneuver.];W[rk];B[ol]
;W[nl];B[pl];W[mk];B[pg];W[sn]LB[kl:a]C[Black thought, after the push of B131, White already has no any tactic left, but the atari of W132 is in fact sente, if Black strengthens in the upper right, White can make the knight's move at 'a', Black is no good either.];B[sm];W[so];B[kl];W[ll];B[km];W[oh]LB[ph:a]C[The wedge of W138 is excellent! Even if Black ataris at 'a', White would still have some loop holes to take advantage of. The variations are very complicated. In the game, I won this game, I was still somewhat lucky.]
