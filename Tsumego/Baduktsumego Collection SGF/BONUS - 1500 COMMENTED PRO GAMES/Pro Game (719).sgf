Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[Lee Changho fourteen straight victory in this tournament ended in this term, but his record was still really worth inspiring.];W[dd];B[cp];W[pp];B[eq]
;W[oc];B[ld];W[jc];B[nd]C[The variation following B9 is simple.];W[od];B[oe];W[nc];B[pe];W[md];B[me];W[ne];B[nf];W[le]
;B[nd];W[mc];B[kd];W[kc];B[qn];W[nq]LB[pk:a][lf:b]C[But since Black can only take one two excellent points 'a' and 'b', Black is a little dissatisfied.];B[pk];W[lf];B[cf];W[df];B[dg]
;W[ef];B[ce];W[cd];B[ch];W[bg];B[eg]LB[bh:a]C[B35 is good order, if Black simply blocks at 'a', White will turn at 35, Black is painful.];W[fg];B[bh];W[ff];B[jf]C[The knight's move of B39 is inevitable, if White encloses with one more move, White's territory at the top will be too big.];W[lh]
;B[jh];W[ig]LB[je:a]C[W42 leads to a fierce fight. If White simply captures two stones by attaching at 'a', the situation is steady.];B[if]LB[jg:a]C[Black's counterattack of B43 is Yoda's style. If Black connects at 'a' normally, Black seems to be taken advantage.];W[jg]C[W44: White has no choice but to push and cut with W44, since Black has the stone B43, White is already not comfortable to capture Black's two stones, from this variation, we can see both players' moves are very passionate.];B[kg];W[kh];B[hg]LB[ih:a][lg:b]C[The exchange of B47 and W 'a' is damaging, Black should simply push at 'b', with the addition of B47 Black doesn't gain liberties, however White gets to obtain some strong moves.]
;W[ih];B[lg];W[mg];B[kf];W[mf];B[ji];W[ii];B[mh];W[jj]LB[li:a]C[W56: White should turn at 'a', Black is not easy to seal off White, then Black will be fraught with grim possibilities.];B[ne];W[ng];B[og]
;W[nh];B[mi];W[lj];B[ni]C[The sequence following B63 is inevitable for both sides, Black kills White by one liberty, but since White has many uses by reducing liberties, White's situation is not that bad as imagined.];W[oh];B[ph];W[oi];B[oj];W[pi];B[qi];W[qh];B[pj];W[pg]
;B[ke];W[of];B[pf];W[ri];B[qj];W[rh];B[og];W[ph];B[rf];W[hf]LB[rj:a][rk:b][rl:c][sj:d][he:e][ie:f]C[White first cuts with W82, it is wrong order, White should first crawl at 'a', after B 'b', White can probe Black at 'c', if Black still reduce one liberty by playing at 'd', then the exchange of W82 and B 'e', 'f' is not necessary, Black has no way to destroy White's territory at the top, this variation is better than the real game.]
;B[he];W[gf];B[ie];W[rj];B[rk];W[rl];B[sj];W[pl];B[nk];W[rn];B[hc]C[Through B93, Black is a little favorable.];W[gq];B[nm]
;W[qm];B[qk];W[qc];B[rc];W[mn];B[nn];W[ml];B[pn]LB[nl:a][qo:b]C[B103 is a bad move! Black should connect at a', White is left with the aji of extending at 'b', it makes a big difference.];W[qo];B[pm];W[mo]
;B[op];W[oq];B[gp];W[hp];B[go];W[fq];B[ep];W[ip]LB[dk:a][ho:b]C[W114 is inexplicable. White certainly should split at around 'a', even if White wants to play here, White should attach at 'b'.];B[dl];W[ej];B[dj]
;W[cq];B[cr];W[co];B[bp];W[ek];B[dk];W[fm];B[hn]LB[en:a]C[B125: Black elects to destroy each other's territory, in fact, for Black to enclose at 'a' is bigger, this way it will be a close game.];W[en]C[In the real game, White destroys Black's side territory, White is slight favorable for the game.];B[eo];W[dn]
;B[qb];W[pc];B[rb];W[hb];B[gb];W[ib];B[gc];W[bq];B[er];W[di];B[ci];W[bo];B[ap]
;W[dp];B[dq];W[do];B[br];W[hm]LB[ql:a]C[W146: White should connect at 'a', I think the game is still early, White is not bad.];B[im];W[ao];B[aq];W[in]LB[em:a][ql:b]C[W146 and W150 are losing moves! This kind of strong play was rarely seen in Lee Changho's games, White's aji in the center is too bad! And Black still has the tactic of squeezing at 'a', White's play is far-fetched.]

;W[fl];B[gj];W[fk];B[jl];W[ik];B[kn];W[jm];B[km];W[im];B[ko]C[In the real game, Black can connect back or capture White at the bottom, White has to concede defeat.])
