;B[oq];W[cn];B[qg]LB[qj:a][fc:b]C[B9 protecting the corner is rarely seen, the common move is to connect all together at 'a' or approach the corner at 'b'.];W[kq]C[W6, W8 and W10 are Lee Changho's lovable opening.];B[fc];W[cf];B[jd];W[dq];B[fe];W[di]
;B[oc]C[Through B17, each side encloses their own moyo.];W[jj]C[However, White gets to take Tengen with W18 and should be satisfied.];B[fi];W[jh];B[fk]LB[dn:a]C[Before jumping with B21, Black should attach at 'a' to use the stone B5.];W[fm];B[jl];W[hm];B[hl];W[gl];B[hk]
;W[im]TR[fq]C[With the extension of W28, White completely captures the marked black stone, White's efficiency is too high.];B[jk];W[mi];B[oi];W[jf]LB[mk:a]C[I can't agree to the jump of W32, I feel to stick the head out at 'a' is clearly better.];B[nk]LB[eg:a][dg:b]C[Black gets a big territory by sealing off with B33. However Black should first hang at 'a' to exchange with W 'b'.];W[fg]C[W34 is alert! In order to separate White, Black has to give up two stones, White gains a good profit.

After this move, it is time for lunch break.]
;B[eg];W[ff];B[ef];W[ee];B[ge];W[eh];B[fh];W[dg];B[gg];W[df];B[gf];W[mf];B[lp]C[B47 enclosing territory first is a clever move. If continuing to attack White, Black may end in gote.]
;W[kp];B[lo];W[pq];B[qq];W[nq]C[W50 and W52 are a careful play after situational judgement, White thinks he doesn't need to destroy more of Black's territory and White already has enough, here shows Lee Changho's strength. From the later process, White is indeed always a little favorable.];B[op];W[mk];B[ml];W[lk];B[kj];W[ki];B[ij];W[oh]
;B[pi];W[of];B[pf];W[mr];B[kg];W[kf];B[ld]LB[dk:a][el:b]C[Black exchanges B65 and W66 then jumps with B67, it is a bait in order to obtain sente. Since Black must get to jump to 'a', otherwise White can close all territory by making diagonal at 'b', Black will lose big.];W[ll];B[mm];W[nj];B[ok]
