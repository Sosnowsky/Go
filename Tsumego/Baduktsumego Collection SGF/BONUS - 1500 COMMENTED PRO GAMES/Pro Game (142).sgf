Translation:GoGameWorld.];B[qd]C[Gu L7 up and Song TaeKon 5p are all fast improving new stars in the recent years, the latter defeated Lee Changho and advanced to the final of this year's Fujitsu final, their strength can't be underestimated.];W[dc];B[pq];W[dp];B[de]
;W[ce];B[dd];W[cd];B[ec];W[cf];B[db];W[cc];B[kc]LB[fc:a]C[B11 and B13: Because the "large avalanche" joseki is played too often, Black intentionally seeks variation, but the pincer of W 'a' is a severe counter-attack.];W[qk];B[qo];W[qh];B[qf]
;W[oh]TR[qo]LB[fc:a]C[As to the small-knight's corner enclosure of the marked black stone, the jump of W18 is over steady, from the state of mind, White certainly should answer with the pincer at 'a'.];B[fd]C[In the game, Black is able to come back and reinforce with the tiger's move at 19, Black's opening is satisfactory.];W[jq];B[og]TR[qo]C[However, although the ensuing attachment of B21 is of momentum, it is too far from the marked black stone and seems unreasonable.];W[ng];B[nh];W[mg];B[of]LB[oi:a][me:b]TR[qo]C[B25: If Black first atari at 'a' to prevent the ladder, but White can dive in at 'b', the weakness of the marked black stone would be exposed.]
;W[ni]C[White can capture one stone in the ladder and should have nothing to complain.];B[ph]LB[ep:a]C[The ladder breaker of B 'a' is too damaging. In the game Black also has no choice but to play the atari of B27.];W[mh];B[pi];W[qi];B[pj];W[qj]LB[pk:a]C[But W32 is obviously a questionable move, White should press out at 'a', here White is very light and should not be afraid if Black pushes and cuts at 32.];B[pk];W[pl]
;B[ol]LB[rm:a][nk:b]C[When W34, B35 is a questionable move! Black should first knight peep at 'a', which is the vital point! No matter how White answers, Black will jump out at 'b' to attack White's two groups, this way Black is not bad at all.];W[qm];B[me];W[qc]C[The attachment of W38 is a common play.];B[pc];W[pd];B[oc];W[jg]C[After leaving some aji in the corner White jumps out at 42 and the local variation comes to an end, Black's opening is not successful, with the sequence after B21, Black has failed in the end.];B[cn]C[B43: Black has no other alternative but to stir a fight.]
;W[fp];B[ck]LB[bp:a][cm:b]C[B45: Black should make the knight's move at 'a' originally, but Black is worried that White will bump at 'b'.];W[ci]LB[co:a][bo:b][bp:c][ch:d][df:e]C[However, W46 is too strange! Now White certainly should make the diagonal's extension at 'a'! Black will most likely hane at 'b', then W 'c', B 'd' and W 'e'.];B[bp];W[mq];B[om]LB[jd:a]C[As to the extension of B49, W50 is unnecessary, now the shoulder hit at 'a' is right timing.]
;W[ro];B[rn]C[B51: Black hanes and captures one stone, White has incurred some losses.];W[qn];B[rp];W[po];B[so];W[qp];B[ro];W[pn]C[W58: White has to connect and is extremely painful!];B[pp]LB[rl:a]C[B59: Black has missed a good opportunity, Black should strike at 'a' to probe White, it is an excellent timing, White instantly would have no answer.];W[ok]C[The simple cut of W60 is of mood.]
;B[nk]C[The sequence after B61 just fits to Black's plan.];W[pg];B[nj];W[qg];B[pf];W[no]C[After Black is cut by W62 in sente, White jumps out with W66, Black is no good in the entire war.];B[kk];W[jd]LB[lj:a][ml:b]C[W68 is overhasty! White should make the knight's move at 'a', which is the vital point for eye shape! If Black blocks, then White can peep at 'b', Black would be still not alive and is very painful.];B[jf]LB[jc:a]C[B69: Black has to counteract like this! If Black crawls at 'a', it equals to conceding defeat.]
;W[kg]C[W70: Now White comes to peep and it is too late, both sides get into a chaotic fight.];B[he];W[hd];B[ie];W[kd];B[id];W[jc];B[le]LB[kf:a]C[B77 is a dangerous move! Black can only attach at 'a'.];W[mc]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.];B[mb];W[nb]
;B[nc];W[lb]LB[lc:a]C[W82 is no good, White should play at 'a', Black is defective himself and dares not to kill White stubbornly.];B[lc];W[ma];B[ld];W[kb];B[ib];W[nd]LB[ic:a][jb:b]C[The following W88 is the losing move! If White simply pushes at 'a' then connects at 'b', Black most likely has no courage to kill White's big dragon, this way after White's big dragon makes live, this would make a big difference in the endgame.];B[qb]
;W[ic];B[hb];W[jb];B[kf];W[hc];B[gb];W[ob];B[md];W[pb];B[rc];W[mb];B[li]C[After White's big group has lived painfully, Black takes the vital point at 101, Black instantly has gained an overwhelming advantage.];W[hg]
;B[cq];W[dq];B[io];W[hp];B[di];W[ch];B[kp]LB[fg:a]C[But the play of B109 is not very simple and clear, Black should separate at 'a' and attack White, Black would be optimistic.];W[kn]LB[ln:a]C[W110: White should get out with the knight's move at 'a', Black will make trouble for himself and be hard to retreat as a whole.];B[ln]C[B111 is a strong move! Although it is a chaotic fight, but overall Black has the initiative, in the end Black has achieved a big victory.]
