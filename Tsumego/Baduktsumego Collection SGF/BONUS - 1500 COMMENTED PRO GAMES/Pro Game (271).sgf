Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[In this game against Kong Jie 7p, Chang Hao made several mistakes in a very favorable situation, and eventually lost the game by just half point, it is very regrettable.];W[dd];B[pp];W[dp];B[fc]
;W[cf];B[db];W[cc];B[ic];W[oc];B[dg]LB[jc:a]C[B11 is trend, aiming to guard against White's attachment at 'a'.];W[cg];B[pc];W[od];B[pe];W[lc];B[fq]
;W[cn];B[nq]LB[dr:a]C[B19 is positive, the common move is to fly into the lower left corner at 'a'.];W[qj]C[W20: White can consider to split at 'a'.]LB[qk:a];B[qh];W[qm]LB[qo:a]C[W20 and W22 leaves Black the excellent point at 'a', White can't be satisfied.];B[qo];W[iq];B[kq]
;W[eq];B[fp];W[io];B[fm];W[er];B[dm];W[cm];B[dl];W[jb]C[W34 looks small but big in reality, since it is related to both sides' base.];B[jc];W[ib];B[hb];W[kc]

;W[gr];B[ob];W[nb];B[pb];W[pd]LB[hc:a]C[W56 is to create ko threats and prepare to cut at 'a', but for White to play here is too far-fetched.];B[qe];W[hc];B[hd];W[gc];B[gb];W[ge];B[eg]C[B63 is a good move, White sinks into a bitter battle.]
;W[he];B[gf];W[fh];B[ei]LB[di:a]C[B67: Black should jump to 'a', here only if Black can separate White's two stones on the outside, Black will take initiative.];W[eh]C[W68 is a strong move, being able to capture Black's key stones, White should have nothing to complain.];B[dh];W[di];B[ci];W[dj];B[ch];W[cj]
;B[bj];W[ck]LB[bk:a]C[But W76 is too unreasonable! For White to play hane at 'a' is just fine.];B[ej]C[B77 is intense!];W[gi];B[cl];W[bk];B[bl];W[bi];B[bh];W[aj];B[ah]
;W[ek];B[fj];W[df];B[ai]C[It forms a ko fight, White is about to collapse.];W[bg];B[bj];W[ak];B[dk];W[bi];B[hf]LB[kb:a]C[At the crucial moment, B95 is soft-hearted, if Black plays atari at 'a' and finds this big ko threat, Kong Jie has no way to answer, the game will be over very soon.];W[ag]
;B[ie]C[Of course, after Black takes five stones with B97, the game is also clearly to Black's advantage.];W[fk];B[gj]LB[do:a]C[B99: Black should first do some preparation at around 'a', then escape, White will be in a bitter battle.];W[gk];B[hj];W[hk];B[in];W[ik];B[hi];W[gm];B[do]
;W[co];B[gn];W[fn]C[W106 and W110 are good moves, Black's shape deteriorates, the situation is chaotic.];B[go];W[em]C[Here they conduct a close-contact fight, nobody wants to retreat, the fight is very fierce.];B[dn];W[ep];B[fo];W[fl];B[eo];W[kp];B[fr]

;B[an];W[bo];B[ij];W[al];B[hl];W[ho];B[hn];W[lo]LB[ni:a]C[W166 is an overplay. White should strengthen at 'a', the game still can continue.];B[mj]C[After Black cuts with B167, White is weak on the whole board and showing a losing trend.];W[mi];B[nj]
;W[lh];B[nl]C[B171 is a good move.];W[oi];B[mm]C[Next Black wraps up with B173 and is really happy!];W[ln];B[kn]C[So far, all observers think the game will end soon, but afterwards Chang Hao gains nothing by attacking, he didn't play well.];W[ko];B[nk];W[kn];B[ni]LB[pj:a]C[B179: Black should first crosscut at 'a', White is not easy to handle.]
;W[nh];B[oh];W[ng];B[og];W[nf];B[om];W[rh];B[qg]LB[ri:a]C[B187: Black also should play hane at 'a', this way it is hard to see how White makes life.];W[pn];B[no];W[po];B[qp]
;W[pk]C[W192 is a good move! After this move, Black is already not easy to kill White.];B[ql]C[But the play of B193 is obviously not going to work.];W[pl];B[pm];W[qn];B[rl];W[rm];B[ro];W[rk]LB[sl:a]C[W200 is also a mistake! If White plays hane at 'a', White will be much better in points, this way White will be favorable.];B[sm]C[B201 is an excellent move, the situation again becomes intense.]
;W[sn];B[rn];W[sl];B[ri];W[qi]LB[sj:a]C[The original move of W206 is to make life at 'a', but White will incur loss in points and White is not good.];B[md]LB[sj:a]C[Black is left with the tactic of ko-killing at 'a'.];W[oe];B[le]LB[sj:a][nc:b]C[B209 is the losing move, now if Black initiates the ko at 'a', since Black has numerous ko threats at 'b', White will lose the game for sure.]
