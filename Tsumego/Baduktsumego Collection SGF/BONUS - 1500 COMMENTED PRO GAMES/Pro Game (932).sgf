;W[cn];B[jp];W[qf];B[pi];W[po]LB[pn:a]C[Yamashita likes to play W8 and W10, but in the real game, White is being separated into two groups and not successful. Perhaps W10 at 'a' is a little better, which he also used it before.];B[pm];W[lo];B[nq];W[lq];B[no];W[jr]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.]

;B[cj];W[ch]LB[nm:a]C[Till the end, White didn't realize the importance of atari at 'a', this can be regarded as White's losing cause in this game.];B[cc]C[B87 and B89 are clearly Teacher Cho's style, taking territory at maximum limit.];W[dc];B[db];W[gp]LB[cl:a]TR[cj]C[The original move of W92 is to make one-space extension at 'a', this way White can capture B87 (the marked stone).];B[fp];W[fo]
