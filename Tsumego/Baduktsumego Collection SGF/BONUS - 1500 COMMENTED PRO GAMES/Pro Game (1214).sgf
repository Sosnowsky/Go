;W[dc];B[cj];W[gd]C[Through W22, the opening is very rare, Kato 9p tries to avoid Gu Li's familiar patterns.];B[fq];W[cn];B[ip];W[po];B[oo];W[qq]
(;B[pp]LB[op:a][pn:b][on:c][pm:d][qr:e][qp:f]C[B29: Black can elect to retreat at 'a', followed by W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 'e' and W 'f', this joseki is better for Black (see var a), in the real game, Black's moyo at the bottom looks thin and weak.];W[qp];B[on];W[qn];B[or];W[qr];B[lb]C[B35 is huge, if White takes this point, White's territory would become real, White's efficiency is too high.]
;W[pd];B[qc];W[kc];B[nb];W[nq];B[np];W[mq];B[pn];W[qo];B[mp]LB[oq:a][kq:b]C[The press of B45 is a good move! If Black simply plays at 'a', White can play at 'b' to fix his shape, in the game, White loses the room for making one space extension, White becomes very heavy. Looking back, for White to invade at 'b' is better. Invasion and reduction should be always as light and nimble as possible.];W[lq]

;B[eg]LB[ch:a]C[B71: In this situation, Black has to push out and fight, if Black hangs at 'a', Black indeed is hard to tolerate.];W[ch]C[After the descent of W72, White can adequately fight. However next Kato makes a fatal mistake!];B[de];W[ee];B[cg];W[ei];B[ed];W[fd]LB[fe:a][gf:b]TR[ei][dh][ch]C[W78: White should turn at 'a'. In the game, Black is left with the free utilization of B 'a' and 'b', greatly impacting the vitality of the marked three white stones.]

;W[bl]LB[dl:a][cm:b]C[White has no choice but to play W92, if White counterattacks by attaching at 'a', then Black will push at 'b', White is not easy to handle either.];B[dk]C[After Black runs out with the diagonal of B93, defense and offense are reversed, White instead sinks into a bitter fight.];W[fi];B[gh];W[hg];B[hh];W[dl];B[ek];W[el];B[ig]
