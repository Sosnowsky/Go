Copyright by gogameworld.com and weiqi.tom.com.];B[pd]C[This game is very surprising, when we were still studying the variations, suddenly the game was already over. In this game, Lee Sedol's play is a little careless, it is perhaps one of his characters.];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[qk]
;W[gq];B[fc];W[cf];B[jd]C[The opening from B1 to B9 forms the "Chinese Fuseki".];W[qf];B[re];W[rf]LB[pi:a][ok:b][ni:c]C[W12 is a little unexpected, normally White will escape at 'a', next B 'b' and W 'c'. In the real game, W12 seems heavy, I feel it is not good.];B[qh];W[qd]
;B[qc];W[qe];B[rc];W[od];B[pc];W[ph];B[pi]LB[oe:a][qi:b][rh:c][ri:d]C[B21 is a very questionable move in the opening, it is also the reason that leads to Black's bitter battle in the very early stage of the game, I think Black can only hane at 'a', followed by W 'b' and B 'c', next if White blocks at 'd', then Black can cut at 21, this way Black is not bad.];W[oe];B[pe]
;W[pf];B[of];W[og];B[nf];W[oi];B[pj]LB[me:a][qi:b][rh:c][hd:d][po:e][oc:f]C[B29: If Black makes the diagonal extension at 'a', then W 'b', B29, W 'c', B 'd' and W 'e', because there exists the aji of White's block at 'f' inside Black's territory, this variation is also to White's advantage.];W[oc]C[White's counterattack with the sequence from W22 to W30 is inevitable.]
;B[ob];W[nb]
(;B[pb]LB[nc:a][oa:b][nd:c][mc:d][md:e][mb:f][ld:g]C[Black is very inconvenient with the hane and connect of B31 and B33. If Black cuts at 'a' with B33, then W33, B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f' and W 'g', this way Black is not good either (see var a).];W[md]C[After White jumps with W34, Black's opening completely fails.];B[lf];W[ng]C[When Black jumps with B35, W36 is the vital point for the shape, Gu Li's feeling is very sharp in this area.];B[mg];W[mh]
;B[lh];W[li];B[mi];W[nh];B[kh];W[kc]C[White gets to obtain sente and then strengthens to make life with W44.];B[jc];W[jb];B[ib];W[lb];B[ja];W[kb]C[Through W50, White makes life, it seems White is already invincible.]

(;B[lj]LB[mj:a][rd:b][qg:c][pg:d][ni:e][rh:f][ri:g][rg:h][se:i]C[B51: Teacher Liu Xiaoguang 9p thinks, Black can also extend at 'a', if W 'b', then B 'c', W 'd', B 'e', W 'f', B 'g', W 'h' and B 'i', White is no good (see var a), therefore When B 'a', White can only play at 'e', this way Black should be better than the real game.];W[rd];B[qg];W[pg];B[ki]LB[rb:a]C[B55: Black already has no state of mind to strengthen at 'a' to make life.]
;W[oa]C[In the game, after White's hane of W56, in the corner there is a multi-stage ko, it basically equals to clean death. So far, the game for Black is already as good as lost.];B[rb];W[sc];B[sb];W[qa];B[pa];W[ra];B[nc];W[mc];B[na];W[mb];B[cc]LB[jq:a]C[B67: Black stirs troubles in the upper left corner, I feel it is not urgent, Black should first extend at 'a', expanding his moyo at the maximum limit in an unfavorable situation and creating troubles, now this is the only thing that Black can do.]
;W[dc];B[db];W[ic]LB[hc:a][cd:b]C[The cut of W70 is a very alert asking move, the purpose to strengthen at the top in sente, if Black tries to capture this stone in a ladder by playing at 'a', White can turn at 'b'.];B[id];W[hc];B[hb]C[The counterattack of B71 and B73 is inevitable, Black can't think of capturing in a ladder, but in this fight Black is a little far-fetched.];W[eb];B[cb];W[hd];B[he]
;W[gd];B[fd];W[ge];B[fe];W[gf];B[gc];W[ff];B[ef];W[eg];B[dg];W[ee]C[W88 is a strong and unyielding good move, it seems Black is very hard to answer.];B[df];W[de]
;B[ce]C[B91: Black has no other choice but to sacrifice.];W[cd];B[ec];W[eh]C[Through W94, it seems the fight is difficult for Black.]
(;B[cg]LB[bg:a][ci:b][dh:c][di:d][bh:e][be:f][bi:g][ck:h][ei:i]C[B95 is the last losing move, it is too simple, Teacher Liu Xiaoguang points out, Black should jump to 'a', next W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 'e', W 'f', B 'g', W 'h' and B 'i', this way although it is still to White's favor, Black can still continue (see var a).];W[be];B[di];W[bg]C[After White hangs with W98, White easily handles his group at the top.]
;B[bh];W[ah];B[gh];W[ei];B[dj];W[fg];B[cq];W[cp];B[dq];W[ep];B[bi];W[je]C[After White attaches and kill Black's three stones at the top with W110, there still needs many moves, but basically it has nothing to do with the outcome of the game.];B[bc]
