Translation:GoGameWorld.];B[qd]C[In the game 4 of best-of-5 of the 15th Kisung title match, Choi Cheolhan 7p took Black and defeated Lee Changho 9p by 2.5 points, grabbing the title again from Lee Changho's hands by 3:1. ];W[dd];B[pq]C[To defeat Lee Changho in two consecutive serial games is really not easy. From the contents of these games, although there are some immature places, but every single move of Choi Cheolhan shows strong confidence --- no matter who the opponent is, only if you think how to fulfil your own idea and play your strongest move --- this is perhaps the winning reason of Choi Cheolhan.];W[oc];B[md]
;W[qk];B[od];W[qo]C[White first plays the splitting move of W6 then approaches the corner with W8, which is the upgrade version of this opening, if White first approaches at 8, Black will play a pincer at 6.];B[dp];W[pc]LB[mq:a]C[The sequence following W10 leads to a fierce fight, but the result is not to White's advantage. Mr. Wu Qingyuan (Go Seigen) taught us a lot of times: to play at the broad place. In this game, with W10, for White to play at 'a' is relatively better.];B[pd];W[mc];B[nc];W[nb];B[nd];W[lc]
;B[mb];W[ob]LB[lb:a]C[W18 is also farfetched, but playing at 'a' to sacrifice is not good either.];B[lb];W[kc];B[kb];W[jc];B[jb];W[ic];B[ib]C[B25: At any rate Black shouldn't just capture the four stones in the corner, that way White will play at 25 to sacrifice the corner, the outside is broader and wider, Black is not good.];W[rc];B[hc]
;W[hd];B[gd];W[gc];B[hb];W[ie];B[ge]C[B29 and B33 are strong moves! White is being separated and sinks into a bitter fight.];W[qh]LB[ph:a]C[If White can imagine Black would tangle with the good move at 'a', with W34 White should play the knight's move at 'a' to look after the center lonely stones.];B[ph];W[pi];B[oi];W[ig]
;B[fc];W[cg];B[pj];W[qi];B[oh];W[oj]C[White has no other choice but to obtain sente with W44, allowing Black to make a ponnuki.];B[pk];W[pl];B[ok];W[qj];B[nj];W[cc]LB[ii:a]C[The original move of W50 is to strengthen at 'a', in the game in order to obtain territory, Lee Changho is a little hasty.]
;B[dh];W[ch];B[dj]LB[ii:a]C[B53 is eyeing for White from afar, not seeking to deliver a fatal blow immediately, Choi Cheolhan clearly thinks he is favorable for the game. In fact for Black to cap at 'a' attacking strongly is very powerful.];W[ii];B[jp];W[op];B[oq];W[np];B[qp];W[pp];B[qq];W[ro]
;B[mq];W[di];B[ei];W[ci];B[ij]C[B67 is beautiful! After this move, at the bottom Black already forms a huge moyo.];W[ej]C[W68: Because Black is very thick in the surroundings, White dares not fight a direct confrontation.];B[hi]C[After the hane of B69, White's big dragon is very painful.];W[ji];B[hh];W[jj];B[ik]LB[jk:a]C[Perhaps since Black's tempo is so smooth, B73 is a slack move! Black should play the double-hane at 'a', driving White to Black's iron wall, not only Black can take advantage and it would also help the fight on the left side.]
;W[jk];B[ek];W[fj];B[dk];W[fk]LB[fi:a]C[After W78, it can be easily seen that if W74 is a black stone, with B79 Black could attach at 'a'.];B[fl];W[fi];B[gl];W[em];B[el];W[cq]C[After White enters the corner with W84, the situation suddenly becomes close, although Black is very thick on the whole board and the game is still slightly favorable for Black, but playing with Lee Changho, you have to fight desperately all the time, you can not be soft-hearted with even one single move!]

;W[iq];B[jq]C[In the following endgame fight, Choi Cheolhan never plays any careless move again, and also because Black is indeed very thick on the whole board, even if Lee Changho, the number one in endgame skill, can't find any chance to turn the game around, eventually Choi Cheolhan won the game by 2.5 points.];W[ip];B[gq];W[gr];B[hg];W[kg];B[rd];W[qb];B[eh];W[fg];B[fh];W[gh]
