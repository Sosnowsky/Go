(;B[ok]LB[nc:a][qq:b][pq:c][ol:d][om:e][pp:f]C[B15 varies first, it is obvious that this is specially prepared "gift" for Lee Changho. In the Wang-Nie game, Black knights at 'a', followed by W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 'e', B 'f' cuts, leading to a fierce fight (see var a).];W[nc]C[The counterattack of W16 is certain.];B[oe];W[qc];B[pg]C[B17 and B19 may be also prepared moves and not on-the-spot idea.];W[oj]
;B[qg]C[Both sides are not willing to give in with W20 and B21.];W[pf];B[of];W[re];B[oh];W[pc];B[nk]C[Through 27, it seems Black can fight.];W[oq]LB[nj:a][rg:b][rh:c][ri:d][sg:e][sf:f]TR[pj][pk][oj][qj]C[W28 tenukis to approach the corner, it seems unexpected, but it is reasonable after careful consideration: first, no good result can be expected if White immediately pull out four white marked stones on the right; second, if Black blockades White near 'a' right away, White later still has the maneuver of W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 'e', W 'f' to initiate a ko fight.]
;B[pq]TR[pk][pj][oj][qj]C[B29 is the proper move, not trying to capture the four white stones in a rush.];W[po]C[W30 is a common tactic in this shape.];B[pp]C[B31 is the vital point for the shape.];W[op];B[oo];W[pr];B[qr];W[no];B[on]
;W[lp];B[kp];W[lq];B[ko];W[nn];B[om];W[or]C[Through 44, Black obtains sente and can be satisfied.];B[lr];W[mr];B[kr]C[Though the hane and connection of B45 and B47 is not small, but it is somewhat overhasty.];W[rr]C[W48 is excellent timing.];B[qs]LB[rs:a][mq:b][mp:c][ms:d]C[B49 seems no better than 'a'. So far, although Black leaves the manuever of B 'b' cutting, W 'c' and B 'd', and White is not completely alive yet, but it is still too early in the current stage of the game.]
;W[ng];B[nh];W[rg]C[W50 and W52 are related moves.];B[rh];W[og]C[W54 is ingenuous.];B[mg];W[qh];B[ph];W[qi]C[Throught 58, an exchange results, the road to victory or defeat becomes long.];B[md];W[mc];B[kd]C[B61 seems slow.]
;W[dr]C[W62 is a mutual good point.];B[fo];W[em]C[W64 prevents Black from forming a big moyo in the center.];B[cf];W[ch];B[ef];W[fd];B[di];W[ce]C[W70 is a good sequence play.];B[bf];W[ci];B[dj]
;W[dh];B[eh];W[bk]LB[eg:a]C[W76 strengthens himself first, aiming to wedge at 'a'.];B[fi];W[ge]C[W78 tries to prevent being sealed in with sente.];B[dl]C[The counterattack of B79 is very intense.];W[dg];B[cc]C[B81 makes White not comfortable.];W[cd];B[dm]C[B83 pushes through, White needs to make a tough decision.]

;B[gm];W[nj];B[mj];W[mm]C[W100 making life completely is the proper move.];B[er]C[B101 attacks as well as defends.];W[gn];B[fn];W[fm];B[go];W[gl];B[hn]C[B107 seems to gain sente.];W[hm]
;B[im];W[gn];B[db]C[B11 taking the opportunity of ko fight to live the corner is a good move.];W[qo];B[rp];W[ro];B[rq];W[bc];B[bb];W[dc];B[cb];W[bd];B[fb]
;W[gb];B[ab]C[Through 123, Black can be satisfied.];W[ps];B[sr];W[bl];B[bm];W[bq];B[fk]C[B129 has two purposes, attack and defense, White's corner is still not completely alive.];W[ho]C[W130 is a frightening game-deciding play, now it seems B107 extending at 108 is more solid.];B[gm];W[fp];B[gp]
;W[gn];B[in];W[gq];B[ep];W[hp];B[gm];W[cl];B[hl]C[B141 has to eliminate the ko.];W[cm]C[Through 142, White has some gains.];B[hg]C[Black has no choice but to enclose the center with 143.];W[es];B[fs]
;W[ds];B[gr];W[if]C[The reduction at W148 is certain.];B[hf]LB[ig:a][kf:b][jg:c]C[B149 probably should press at 'a', W 'b', B 'c', this is better than the real game.];W[ie];B[jh];W[kf];B[lf]LB[le:a]C[B153 guards against the peep at 'a'.]
;W[gs];B[hs];W[ke];B[le];W[lc];B[ld];W[jc]C[Through 160, White can be satisfied.];B[fc]LB[ll:a]C[B161 seems no better than the knight's move at 'a'.];W[ll];B[lk];W[ml]
;B[mk];W[kl]C[Through 166, Black is not optimistic.];B[sk];W[rj];B[ib]C[B169 is Black's deserved compensation.];W[rk];B[rl];W[gc];B[kc];W[kb];B[jb];W[lb]
;B[jd];W[he];B[id]C[Through 179, Black ends in gote, White has nothing to be dissatisfied.];W[jk]C[W180 totally destroys Black's hope of surrounding the center.];B[lo];W[mp];B[ij];W[jj];B[ji];W[ig];B[ff];W[fl]
