;B[ce];W[dn]LB[dh:a][fe:b][gc:c][dj:d]C[The two-space high approach of W6 is very common nowadays. If White plays the pincer at 'a' normally, then B 'b', W 'c' and B 'd', it will quickly lead to a fight.];B[ed]LB[co:a][dh:b][di:c]C[B7: If Black answers with the small knight's move at 'a', then White perhaps will pincer-attack at 'b' or 'c'.];W[ec];B[fd];W[gc]
;B[cc]LB[cl:a]C[B11 is one of 4-5 point josekis, to pincer at 'a' is also playable.]
(;W[gd]LB[dd:a][de:b][cd:c][fc:d][fb:e][bd:f][cb:g][gb:h][eb:i][hc:j][jc:k]C[W12 is the right move, now one easy mistake that go fans are most likely to make is to push at 'a', thinking this will leave Black a lot of cut points, but after W 'a', B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f', W 'g', B 'h', W 'i' and B 'j', Black captures one stone in the ladder, White is clearly not favorable (see var a). If White connects at 'd' with W12, then Black will connect at 'c', White needs to make a two-space extension at 'k', Black will obtain sente.];B[fc];W[fb]
;B[dd];W[nc];B[qf];W[gf];B[cb]TR[dc][ec]C[Through B19, it is a joseki, it seems Black has gained very substantial points, the marked two white stones already become endgame, White certainly will not connect back.];W[pb];B[qi]LB[qc:a]C[B21: Black doesn't make the diagonal's extension at 'a' in order to leave the chance to invade at the top.];W[qc]C[W22 is very big.];B[ql]LB[qk:a]C[B23: Black has completely settled the right side, otherwise White's forcing move at 'a' is kind of sente, but in the opening making two two-space extensions in a row  always seems slow.]
;W[mf]C[W24: White makes a huge moyo and puts a great hope to enclose the top territory.];B[nq];W[qn];B[pr];W[qq];B[qr]LB[rr:a][rp:b][rq:c][rn:d]C[B29: Black strikes first to attack, trying to take initiative, if White hanes at 'a', then the maneuver of B 'b', W 'c' and B 'd' is obvious.];W[cq]C[W30 is a positive play.];B[no]
;W[om]C[W32: White's shape appears thin.];B[cp];W[dp];B[cr]LB[bp:a]C[B35 is rarely seen, to descend at 'a' is the common joseki.];W[bq];B[br];W[bp];B[co];W[do];B[bn];W[eq]
;B[dr];W[cl];B[bo]C[Through B45, comparing with joseki, both the real game play and the joseki have their pros and cons. So far Black's strategy of first obtaining territory then reducing White's influence is already very clear.];W[jp];B[nm]C[B47 makes White very uncomfortable. So far, Luo Xihe has used 23 minutes and Choi KyuByung has consumed 40 minutes.];W[pk];B[qk];W[pj];B[qj];W[nk]C[The sequence from W48 to W52 is a common play to fix shape, but White's shape is still not complete.];B[cm];W[dm]
;B[bl];W[ck];B[hp]C[The invasion of B57 is good timing, White doesn't have any good attacking maneuver.];W[in]C[W58 is a good move, now the lower side is already not important, White tries to make the center thick, making Black not dare invade the top side, because the top is the only territory on the board for White.];B[fp];W[go];B[gp];W[ep];B[fo];W[gm];B[fr];W[fq]
;B[gr];W[ir];B[hr];W[mm]LB[jo:a]C[W70 is a good move, not only reinforcing himself and also indirectly guarding against Black's crosscut at 'a'.];B[nn]C[B71: Black already has no other choices.];W[nl];B[ko];W[kn];B[el];W[fn];B[fi]LB[dl:a]C[B77 is  a good move, directly cutting at 'a' is a little unreasonable.]
;W[hi]C[After W78, White's center moyo is huge, for Black to just conduct a shallow reduction seems not enough.];B[kc]C[The invasion of B79 is an asking move.];W[jb]LB[md:a]C[W80: White has no assurance of success by playing at 'a' to kill Black.];B[oc]
(;W[nb]LB[ob:a][nd:b][md:c][mc:d][me:e][ld:f][le:g][ne:h][oe:i]C[If W82 at 'a', then B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W82, B 'e', W 'f', B 'g', when White plays the atari at 'h', Black can start a ko at 'i', White is no good (see var a).];B[nh];W[oh]C[W84 is a strong counterattack.];B[nd]
;W[md];B[nf]C[B85 and B87 are clever moves, White is not easy to handle.];W[ne];B[oe];W[od];B[ng]C[Through B91, Black has safely connected and can be satisfied.];W[ph];B[qg];W[qh];B[rh];W[of]C[W96 is a game-deciding move.];B[nd]
;W[rg];B[me];W[ri];B[ld];W[mc];B[le]C[Through B103, it leads to an exchange, Black actually doesn't incur any loss.];W[rr]C[The play of W104 is worth study.];B[ln]C[B105 is severe.];W[jo];B[km];W[jn];B[lm]
;W[lo]LB[rp:a]C[W110 is a mistake, to reinforce at 'a' is the original move.];B[rp]C[B111: Black is alert.];W[ro];B[rq];W[qp];B[sr];W[rs];B[qs]LB[pm:a][pn:b]C[Through B117, Black not only has obtained safety, but Black is also left with the tactic of playing at 'a' or 'b', Black's advantage is clear.];W[kb]C[W118: White has to go out to grab territory, otherwise for Black to block down here is kind of sente.]
;B[pm]LB[op:a][np:b][pn:c]C[B119: Black delivers White the final blow, before this, if White makes the exchange of W 'a' and B 'b', then Black can play at 'c' instead, White still has no chance.]
(;W[pn]LB[on:a][oo:b][po:c]C[W120: White has no choice, if White retreats at 'a', then B120, W 'b' and B 'd', White is no good (see var a).];B[on];W[ol];B[rj];W[sh];B[rm];W[rn];B[qm];W[op];B[np]
;W[sm];B[sl];W[sn];B[sj]C[Through B133, Black is one liberty fast and simply wins the game.])
