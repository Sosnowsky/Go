Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[pd];W[dc];B[dp];W[cn]LB[fq:a]C[The direct approach of W4 appears vigorous, my thinking at that time was if Black makes the knight's move at 'a', I would take the empty corner, this way approaching first perhaps takes a little advantage.]
;B[cl];W[qp];B[ce];W[fq];B[dn];W[cq];B[dq];W[cp];B[do];W[bn];B[dr];W[cr];B[gp]LB[ed:a][oq:b]C[B17 is a good point, making the press at 'a' and the approach at 'b' become excellent points. However I'm thinking that Kong Jie relatively likes territory, so letting him to make a big moyo should be also a strategy.]

(;B[ed]C[As to the knight's move of B19, Black can also play as in the variation a.];W[ec];B[fd];W[gc];B[cm];W[pj];B[gd];W[hc];B[hd];W[ic];B[jj]LB[id:a]C[B29: Black takes the tengen, it seems Black is not bad, but Black should press at 'a' one more time, if White retreats, then Black plays B29, this way it becomes relatively difficult for White to make life inside Black's territory.]
;W[jp]LB[cf:a]C[W30: White can also directly destroy Black's territory by attaching inside at 'a', but I already decided to take territory first, then invade to fight for a victory.];B[jm];W[cf]
(;B[be]LB[dd:a]C[B33: For Black to attach at 'a' is not good, see variation a.];W[ef];B[ch];W[dh];B[cg];W[gh]
(;B[ih]C[B39: Black should play as in the variation.];W[ig]C[The attachment of W40 is severe.];B[hg];W[hh];B[hf];W[ii];B[jh];W[ji];B[ki];W[ij];B[kh];W[gj]C[The sequence up to W50 is inevitable. Comparing with the variation, White is already safe, however Black is not that thick as in the variation, in this area, White clearly is successful.]
;B[qh];W[di]C[W52 is huge, with this move White is not only completely stable, and also it is very valuable. So far, although Black outside is thick but because White has more territory, so I think White is perhaps a little better off in the game.];B[pl]C[The invasion of B53 is inevitable, Black can only fight for a victory by attacking.];W[kj];B[jk];W[lj];B[ll];W[ol];B[om];W[nl];B[nm];W[pm]C[The sequence from W54 to W62 is very strong and unyielding.]
;B[pk]LB[oj:a]C[When Black hits with B63, White can't retreat at 'a', see the variation a.]
(;W[ok]C[The turn of W64 is a brilliant move, it is also my proudest move in this game.];B[qm];W[pn]
(;B[ml]LB[oj:a]C[B67: For Black to cut at 'a' is no good (see var a).];W[nj];B[qj];W[pi];B[rk];W[il];B[jl]C[The exchange of W72 and B73 is alert.];W[qn]C[White happily turns with W74, first strengthening the corner territory, and also threatening Black's big dragon in the center, Black can only target at White's big dragon in the center.]
(;B[mh]LB[mi:a]C[B75: For Black to hit at 'a' is no good, see variation a.];W[mi]C[W76 is the vital point for the shape, if Black doubles up here, White's big dragon would be dangerous.];B[nh];W[lh];B[lg];W[li];B[kg];W[mn];B[mm];W[mk]C[After White makes life with W84, Black didn't achieve any meaningful profit, however in the process White strengthens the lower right corner instead, making Black thin on the whole board, in terms of territory, White is also way ahead, it can be said so far only if White doesn't make any big mistake, the game is already in the bag for White.];B[pc]
;W[og];B[kc];W[bc]LB[qg:a][qi:b][pg:c][rm:d]C[W88 is not simple and clear. White should first attach at 'a', then B 'b', W 'c' and B 'd', forcing Black to make life, then White jumps with W88, this way White ruins Black's territory on the right in sente, White would win the game easily.];B[qg]C[After B89, White has a cutting point here.];W[jd];B[fc];W[fb];B[eb]C[The push and cut of B91 and B93 are asking moves, the timing is excellent.]
;W[db]LB[gb:a][dd:b]C[W94: White can only play atari, if White connects at 'a', then Black's attachment back at 'b' would become sente, White is obviously not good.];B[kd]
(;W[mg]C[When Black attaches with B95, I thought the cut of W96 would end the fight here. But I didn't expect Black would sacrifice several stones at the top. If I lose this game, this move would be the losing move.];B[ng];W[mf];B[nf];W[jf];B[ke];W[je];B[df]C[With W96 and W98, White first suffers a loss of 10+ points, then White has to escape the key stones in the center, Black simply plays B103 to sacrifice a few center stones, but Black still can use these dead stones to take advantage.];W[de];B[dg];W[dd];B[eg]

;W[fj];B[hi];W[ci];B[bi];W[bj];B[ai];W[aj];B[bg]C[After B125, I broke out in a cold sweat, because I really don't understand the moves I just played, how come to lose such a good game! I carefully did a situation judgement, finding my situation is not that bad as it appears, if I can enclose the lower side by attacking Black on the left side, I still can win the game.];W[em]LB[dm:a][hq:b]C[So I played W126, preparing to jump to 'b' after B 'a'.]
(;B[gq]C[The block of B127 is to my surprise, not sure whether I made a mistake or he miscalculated. Black should play as in the variation a.];W[dm]C[After I cut with W128, I found that the situation is already very close.]
(;B[lq]LB[rm:a]C[The invasion of B129 is a mistake, Black should play as in the variation, for example descending at 'a'.];W[mp];B[kp];W[ko];B[jq];W[rm]C[After W134, the game is already slightly to White's advantage.];B[nr];W[or];B[mq]LB[mr:a][ds:b]C[B137: Black has no choice, if retreating to 'a', White will grab the double sente 4-point move at 'b'.]
