;B[de];W[ce]LB[dd:a]C[The play of W6 is common, but as for this game this move can be considered as "fitting in exactly what they wish", because a black move at 'a' will form the "large avalanche" joseki, Park YuongHoon utilized this joseki and defeated his opponents in both game 1 and game 2 of this contest, Kong Jie 7p is obviously well prepared for this variation.];B[dd];W[cd];B[ec];W[cf];B[df];W[dg];B[cc];W[db];B[bc];W[cb]

;B[ai];W[fj];B[dm];W[cn];B[fm]C[Through 45, White gains a lot of territory and can be satisfied.];W[od];B[ld]LB[fg:a]C[It does not take any time for Black to play 47, but this move is worth study, it would be better if this move is first played at 'a' to probe White. So far Kong Jie has used about half hour and Park YuongHoon only consumed 5 minutes, each side has only one hour in regular time.];W[je];B[jd];W[ke];B[kd]
