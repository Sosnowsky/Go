;W[od];B[oc];W[nc];B[pc];W[dh];B[nd];W[mc];B[ne];W[jc];B[pj];W[cd];B[jp]C[Through B17, it forms a situation of territory race.];W[po]
;B[pm]LB[qo:a]C[When White approaches with W18, with B19 Black should attach at 'a', the reason will be clear later on.];W[qq];B[qr];W[qp];B[or];W[no];B[qm]LB[nq:a][rm:b][qo:c]C[The original move of B25 is to make the diagonal at 'a', since Black worries White may make the knight's move at 'b', so Black doubles up with B25, but it is somewhat unreasonable. This is just the reason why Black should attach at 'c' with B19.];W[nq]
;B[pp]C[After W26, Black squeezes with B27.];W[op]C[The tiger's move of W28 is playable.];B[qo];W[jq]LB[ro:a][qn:b][rr:c][pn:d]C[But W30 is slow, White should play atari at 'a', next B 'b' and W 'c', it leads to a capturing race, Black is dangerous. Or with W30 W 'd' is also not a bad move, these are all better than the real game. It can be said that White misses a good chance to take the lead.];B[nr];W[kp];B[mq];W[ip]
;B[cq]C[In the real game, it forms an exchange, but since B35 entering the corner is a obvious good move, White seems to gain nothing.];W[cp];B[dq];W[fq];B[fr];W[de];B[jo]C[The extension of B41 is a good move! White is difficult.];W[mp];B[lq];W[kq];B[lp];W[ko]LB[lo:a]C[White must have a big problem, when Black pushes with B45, White couldn't block at 'a' with W46, White fails badly!]
;B[lo]C[After Black extends out with B47, Black's territory on the right side is big and also thick, White is not good.];W[km];B[cj]C[B49: Black destroys territory first and sails smoothly.];W[ep]C[W50: White originally thinks to make himself thick then come back and attack B49.];B[gq]C[But Black's sequence following B51 are good moves!];W[gp];B[ln];W[gr];B[kn];W[im];B[eq]
;W[fp];B[gs]C[In the corner, Black is left with the tactic of ko-live, and Black gets to handle B49 one stone first, White's shape appears over-concentrated!];W[hq];B[bh]C[Through B61, Black is clearly favorable.];W[bl];B[df];W[be];B[cg];W[ee];B[bf];W[ef];B[cl]
;W[cm];B[bk]LB[ld:a][lc:b][kd:c]C[B71 is a little slow, Black can consider to proceed like B 'a', W 'b' and B 'c'. Black has favorable consciousness.];W[dl];B[ck];W[ng];B[ld];W[lc];B[kd];W[pg];B[jd]
;W[ic];B[id];W[hd];B[he];W[lg];B[kc];W[kb];B[lb];W[jb];B[gd];W[hc];B[gf]LB[mj:a]C[B91 is also slow. Black should jump to 'a' to attack White, this way Black's shape is more vivid.]
;W[nj];B[ml];W[if];B[ie];W[nl];B[nm];W[ol];B[om];W[mk];B[ll];W[qk];B[qi];W[pk]
;B[rg]C[However, through B105, Black is still clearly favorable.];W[bp];B[bq];W[er];B[es];W[fs];B[mh];W[mg];B[fr]LB[oi:a][ni:b][oh:c][nh:d][og:e]C[B113 taking the ko is a careless move! Black should make diagonal at 'a', separating White into two groups, White can only seek to connect at 'b', next B 'c', W 'd' and B 'e', capturing W78, this way Black can simply win the game.]
;W[rh]C[W114 is a good move! This is a desperate play in an unfavorable situation. Although this is territory-damaging, White separates Black in sente and can strongly attack Black's big dragon, the situation is not clear.];B[qh];W[rf];B[qg];W[qf];B[pf];W[of];B[pe];W[oe];B[pd];W[jf]C[Following W124, White attacks Black's big dragon strongly, but since White itself is too thin and can't kill Black.];B[fg]

;B[ji];W[ki];B[kj];W[kh];B[jk];W[ij];B[di];W[dg]LB[hk:a][kk:b][jl:c]C[In the process, Black shouldn't exchange B145 with W146, Black should directly clamp at 'a', next W 'b' and B 'c', Black can connect safely, this variation is better, although the play in the game is also not bad.];B[ik];W[hj]
;B[gj];W[hk];B[gk];W[hl];B[el];W[fs];B[dm];W[hs];B[lj];W[qj];B[oh]LB[ri:a]C[The sequence following B159 is damaging, while being busy for a while, Black doesn't gain anything in the end, Black should play atari at 'a'.];W[nh]
;B[oj];W[ri];B[oi];W[mj];B[og];W[ok];B[hi];W[lk]C[Through W168, the situation is close, Black is a little better.];B[kl];W[kk];B[cf];W[eg];B[fh]

;B[fb];W[fd];B[bb]LB[ge:a][oa:b]C[B189: Black thinks White can throw-in at 'a', it is perhaps damaging. Black should directly hang at 'b', indirectly reinforcing the defect at 'a'.];W[fc];B[hb];W[ff];B[ge];W[fa];B[gb];W[ac];B[oa]
;W[ib]LB[ma:a]C[W198 is an attitude to fight for victory, White is reluctant to eliminate the ko fight at 'a'.];B[gg];W[fl];B[gl];W[dl];B[ma]LB[ek:a]C[B203: Black is resolute! If Black connects at 'a', the situation will be turned around!];W[na];B[hm];W[il];B[ma]

;B[bm];W[ek];B[bn]C[Through W223, it forms an exchange, Black wins the game for sure.];W[bo];B[gm];W[jl];B[cn];W[dm];B[fk];W[el];B[ga];W[ea];B[fe]
