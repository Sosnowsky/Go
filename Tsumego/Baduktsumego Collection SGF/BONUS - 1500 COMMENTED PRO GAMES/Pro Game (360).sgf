;B[kq];W[qj]C[The opening up to W8 is common.];B[qg]LB[pk:a]C[B9: The common move nowadays is to make shoulder-hit at 'a'.];W[qm];B[pk];W[qk];B[pm]C[B11 and B13: It seems Black is prepared, this very easily leads to a fierce fight. If not careful enough, Black will easily sink into passivity.];W[qn];B[pn];W[lp];B[kp]
;W[po]LB[qo:a][pp:b]C[W18 is also not a momentary inspiration. In past games, White will hit at 'a', next B18 and W 'b', this result is to Black's advantage.];B[qo];W[pp];B[pq];W[oq];B[qr]LB[qq:a]C[The tiger of B23 is better than the connection at 'a'.];W[ro];B[rp];W[pr]
;B[qq];W[np];B[lo]C[B29 is the vital point for the shape.];W[nn];B[pl];W[pj];B[mm]C[The knight's seal-off of B33 is very strong and unyielding.];W[lq]LB[ko:a]C[W34 is the vital point for eye shape and White also aims to cut at 'a'.];B[ri]C[B35 is an asking move.];W[rm]C[Although the shape of W36 is not good, White can obtain sente.]
;B[or];W[nr];B[ps];W[nm];B[oo]LB[op:a][nl:b][ml:c][nk:d][ln:e][mo:f]C[The timing of B41 is just right, if White connects at 'a', then B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e' and B 'f', White is not good.];W[ko]C[W42 is the strongest counterattack.];B[mo]
;W[no];B[lm];W[jo];B[iq]C[Through B47, both sides have no way to retreat and both have comprehension.

After this move, it is time for lunch break.];W[ml]LB[nl:a]C[W48 is tighter than the extension at 'a', but Black is also left with the cut at 'a'.];B[op]TR[mo][lo][lm][mm]C[B49: Black is very happy, if White can't attack four black stones efficiently, White is not good.];W[ip];B[jr]
;W[hq];B[hr];W[ll];B[jm];W[il]C[W56: White seals off strongly, the fight is white-hot.];B[im];W[ln];B[km]LB[mn:a]C[B59: Whether Black can connect at 'a' is worth study.];W[mn]C[W60: White happily captures two stones and connects together.];B[nl];W[nk]
;B[ol];W[hp]C[W64 is a mutual good point.];B[kk]LB[lr:a][jk:b][lj:c]C[B65: If Black plays hane at 'a', then W 'b', B65 and W 'c', Black is not comfortable.];W[jq];B[ir];W[kr]C[W68: White takes advantage in sente very happily.];B[dr];W[lj];B[ni]C[B71 directly hits White's vital point.]
;W[ph];B[ng];W[of];B[qf];W[og];B[oj];W[kj];B[jj];W[ji];B[ii]C[The play of B79 and B81 is very fierce and relentless.];W[jk];B[ij];W[hl]
;B[kl];W[kh];B[jg]C[B87 again is a strong move, White instantly feels constrained.];W[lf];B[nf];W[lk]C[W90 is a game-deciding move.];B[ne]C[After B91, White on the right side already can't live unconditionally.];W[oi];B[mi];W[lh];B[qi];W[pi]
;B[mg];W[sn];B[sp]C[After B99, White becomes ko-alive.];W[ld]C[W100: White ignores his big dragon on the right side, assuming a posture of capturing all black stones on the left side of the board.];B[fo]C[B101 prevents White from sealing off.];W[ih]C[After White hanes out with W102, the situation is chaotic, this is White's only choice.];B[jh];W[ki];B[rj];W[hh];B[nc]C[B105 and B107: Black captures White cleanly, Black should be easier to play.]
;W[cr]C[W108 is a good move at this time.];B[dq];W[ep];B[cq]C[W110 and B111: both sides don't want to retreat.];W[fp]C[W112: White pushes and cuts in sente, White should be happy.];B[gq];W[di]C[W114: White grabs the vital point, White again has a chance.];B[fh];W[fi];B[gp];W[go]
;B[gn];W[ho];B[gi];W[gh];B[cm];W[dm];B[dl];W[bm];B[cl];W[bl]C[From B115 to W128, the fight is chaotic.];B[dn]C[B129: Black has many choices, the play in the game is simple out of  favorable consciousness.];W[em]

;W[hj]C[Through W144, White clearly gains, the difference between them is smaller.];B[jd];W[gf]C[W146 is the strongest move.];B[gd];W[he];B[hd];W[fe]C[After W150, it becomes a close game surprisingly, Black's play is clearly a little conservative.];B[ie];W[pc];B[qd];W[oc];B[mc]
;W[lc];B[me];W[ec]C[W158 is a good move.];B[le];W[qc];B[rd];W[rb];B[na]C[B163 is a tesuji to kill.];W[oa];B[pb];W[nb];B[mb]
;W[ma];B[sb];W[sc];B[rc];W[sa];B[qa];W[qb];B[pa];W[ic];B[jc];W[jb];B[lb];W[gb]C[Through W180, White gains some profit.]
;B[fd];W[ee];B[hf];W[ja];B[kb];W[gg]C[Through W186, White unexpectedly encloses a huge territory, it is really hard to imagine.];B[hb];W[rk];B[so];W[fb];B[hc];W[ha];B[lg]
;W[kg];B[kf];W[eq];B[er];W[nq];B[ib];W[js];B[ia]C[After the cut of B201, Black's small victory already can't be altered. White's falling way behind in the first half, although White fights hard, White still ends with a small defeat, it is really regrettable.];W[ge];B[lr];W[ks];B[ga];W[gr]
