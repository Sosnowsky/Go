;W[od];B[oc];W[nc];B[pc];W[eq]C[W10: White doesn't finish the joseki and takes tenuki, which is Cho U's unique tactic and aims to seek speed.];B[nd];W[mc];B[ne];W[jc];B[pj]LB[qn:a][ql:b]C[B15: If Black approaches the corner at 'a', White will pincer at 'b', Black is not easy to handle.]
;W[qm];B[cj]LB[gc:a][hc:b][je:c]C[B17 is the divide in the opening and most discussed. W 'a' is an excellent point, so Black wants to force at 'b' first, this way White definitely will take tenuki and play at the super big point of B17, Black can cap at 'c' next. But Black can't get both, in terms of this game's process, for Black to play at 'b' is relatively better.];W[gc];B[nq];W[pq];B[jp]LB[kq:a]C[B21 at 'a' is the original move.];W[cl];B[gq]
;W[el]LB[hq:a]C[W22 and W24 is Cho U's unique conception. Black's shape at the bottom is not good, generally for White to play at 'a' with W22 is good enough.];B[no]LB[lq:a]C[B25 is strong move! Black still plays this way even if knowing White's tactic at 'a'. But Black is really reluctant to come back and reinforce here.];W[lq]C[W26 is shape, the game enters into a close-contact fight early on.];B[lp];W[kp];B[ko];W[kq];B[lo]LB[mp:a][mq:b]C[B31: Black can consider to retreat at 'a', in the game White bumps at 'b', Black is not comfortable.]
;W[ir];B[hp];W[mq];B[oq];W[hq]C[W36 is good move, here Black clearly doesn't want White to cross over.];B[po]LB[gr:a][gp:b][ip:c][fq:d][hr:e][go:f][qo:g]C[B37 is wrong order, Black should first play at 'a', next W 'b' and B 'c', now if W 'd', Black doesn't need to play the damaging move of B37; if W 'd' at 'e', then B37, White probably will elect to exchange at 'f', then Black pushes down at 'g', this result is better for Black.]
;W[qo];B[gr];W[gp];B[ip];W[fq]C[Kong Jie perhaps didn't expect White simply sacrifices four stones with W42, it seems Black is not bad, but in terms of the whole game, White has more territory, amazingly it is already a difficult game for Black. Here we can see, Cho U's skill of taking control the whole situation is very strong.];B[go];W[fp];B[jr];W[hr];B[jq];W[cf];B[ej];W[ch]
;B[fh]LB[ee:a]C[B51: Black perhaps should protect the corner at 'a'.

After this move, it is time for noon break.];W[ee]LB[dc:a]C[After the cap of W52, White can crosscut at 'a' in the corner, Black is very difficult.];B[fd];W[gf];B[gd];W[hc];B[ff];W[fe];B[ge];W[fi]
;B[eh];W[fg];B[gg];W[ef];B[hf]C[As to the strong seal-off of B65, Cho U releases excellent tesuji.];W[ei]C[W66: Next, no matter how Black to play, Black couldn't seal off White.];B[gi];W[di];B[gj];W[fj];B[fk];W[ek]C[Through W72, locally White surely gains.]
;B[ld];W[kc];B[pn];W[qn];B[qk];W[kf];B[je];W[hg]LB[oi:a]C[W80 is a careless move, if White first makes ko threat at 'a', Black is more difficult to handle.];B[ff];W[oi];B[eg]LB[bg:a]C[After Black takes with B83, Black's tactic at 'a ' is working, locally White incurs a huge loss.]
;W[pi];B[qi];W[nf]C[W86: White starts to dodge, the offense and defense here will decide the game.];B[qh];W[oe];B[le];W[oj];B[ok];W[nk];B[nh]LB[of:a]C[B93 is the losing move, Black should cut at 'a', White is not easy to handle the big dragon, the situation is unclear.];W[ol]
;B[pk];W[pg];B[ph];W[oh];B[ng];W[og];B[mf];W[of];B[lh];W[rg]C[White jumps with W96 and W104, Black's territory has been destroyed completely, and Black can't capture White, Black suddenly sinks into a losing situation.];B[qg];W[qf];B[qe]C[B105 and B107 are far-fetched.]
;W[rj]C[After W108, White gets the job done at one go.];B[qj];W[re];B[pf];W[pe];B[nj];W[ni];B[mj];W[mi];B[li];W[rf];B[mh];W[ri]
;B[rh];W[mk];B[lj];W[rk];B[nl];W[pl];B[ml];W[sh]C[W128: White crosses over in the first line, the big dragon escapes successfully, Black suffers a big defeat.];B[lk];W[rd];B[rc];W[ql];B[nk]
