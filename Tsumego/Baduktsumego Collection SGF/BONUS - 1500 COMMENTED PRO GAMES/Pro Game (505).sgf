Since Choi is leading by 1:0, in this game Lee Changho aggressively takes territory and shows the posture that he must win this game.];W[dd];B[pp]C[The two-star opening of B1 and B3 is a new trend recently, it was once popular and may become popular again.];W[dp];B[fq];W[cn]
;B[dr];W[nq];B[qn];W[hq];B[cq];W[eq];B[er];W[fp];B[gp];W[gq];B[fr];W[go];B[fc]C[With B5, W8 and B19, they approach each other's corner.]

;B[ce];W[dh];B[jd];W[bp];B[cp];W[co];B[qf];W[hp];B[bq]C[Through B41, Black takes four corners, White is thick,  the structure of the game is clear.];W[hc]LB[he:a]C[As to the invasion of W42, the common play is to cap at 'a', which is relatively light and nimble, in the real game both sides play on their own.];B[fb]
;W[ie];B[ea];W[je];B[fe];W[kd]C[Through W48, White captures one stone and has nothing to complain.];B[gi]LB[ci:a][fj:b][gg:c]C[B49: Black makes compromise, Black has the state of mind to first peep at 'a' in sente then reduce territory completely by playing at 'b'. In the game, although Black's press is sente, but after White separates at 'c', Black's two stones still come under attack, so Black should invade one line deeper, at any rate Black will get attacked.];W[ej];B[fj];W[ek]
;B[mc];W[gg];B[ji]LB[kj:a]C[B55 is heavy! Black should escape out quickly by playing at 'a', in the game after being attacked, White is thick across the board.];W[li];B[jk];W[lk];B[gl];W[qj];B[pr];W[pc];B[qc];W[qd]
;B[rd];W[nc];B[oc]C[Black has no other choice but to defend with B61 and B67.];W[nd];B[nb];W[mb];B[ob];W[lc];B[jm];W[or];B[oq];W[nr];B[ql]
;W[no];B[on];W[hm]C[Next, Black again strengthens with the jump of B73, but Black is still not completely stable, the attack of W80 is still severe, Black appears passive in the game.

After this move, it is time for noon break.];B[ll];W[ml];B[lm]LB[kl:a][mm:b][hl:c]C[B83: For Black to simply retreat at 'a' is better, next W 'b' and B 'c'.];W[kk];B[kl];W[il]
;B[jl];W[nn]C[With the sequence from B81 to W88, Black is not alive and very painful.];B[ko];W[pm]C[W90 is a good move!];B[pn];W[hk]C[The attack following W92 becomes very severe!];B[ik];W[gk];B[kq];W[nm]C[W96 becomes sente.];B[mp]
;W[np];B[pl];W[kn];B[ln];W[jp]C[White's attack of W100 and W102 is not soft-hearted.];B[kp];W[oj]C[White gets to come back and reinforce with W104, White is favorable in the game.];B[hl];W[gm]LB[im:a]C[As to the cut of B105, with W106 White definitely can't connect at 'a', this way Black will turn at 106, White will collapse. In the game Black obtains endgame advantage.];B[fl];W[fk]
;B[im];W[jn]C[With White's strong attack following W110, Black suffers damage to seek life.];B[lr];W[jr];B[jq];W[ir];B[jo];W[in];B[io];W[ho];B[mq];W[ip];B[ki]C[B121 is the vital point to make life.]
;W[ij]C[But White tangles tenaciously with the sequence following W122.];B[lh];W[mi];B[lj];W[mj];B[kj];W[mk];B[hj];W[hi];B[ii];W[gj];B[jg];W[ih]
;B[hh];W[hj];B[jj];W[ig];B[jh]C[Through B139, although Black avoids being killed, but Black's loss is heavy.];W[rk];B[rl];W[qg]C[Because Black in the center is not alive, as to the attachment of W142, Black has to make compromise.];B[pg];W[qh];B[of];W[sl]
;B[sm];W[sk];B[qm];W[rf];B[re];W[ao]C[White is able to get the biggest endgame with W152, White is slightly favorable in the game.];B[pi]C[The sequence following B153 shows Lee's excellent endgame skill, making life in sente.];W[ph];B[pj];W[oi];B[qk];W[ng]

;W[gd];B[fd];W[ib];B[gc];W[hd];B[dn];W[eo];B[fg]C[Then Black presses White with B171 and B179.];W[gf]LB[ps:a][gh:b]C[W180 is careless and the losing move! White should first hane at 'a', then cut at 'b', White will win the game by a small margin.];B[ci]
;W[ch];B[ef];W[df];B[ei];W[fi];B[gh]C[B185 and B187 are good moves! The situation has been turned around.];W[eh];B[if];W[aq];B[br];W[ps];B[qr];W[hg]
;B[ge]LB[fh:a]C[The inexplicable thing happens! B195 is a rare big mistake, Black forgot W 'a' is sente then White pushes, after White takes with W196, Black concedes defeat immediately. By 0:2, Lee Changho faces an impasse.];W[fh]C[The game 3 will take place on 2/19.])
