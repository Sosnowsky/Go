Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[In the game 3 of the 31st Gosei best-of-3 title match, the challenger Cho U 9p defeated Yoda Norimoto 9p by 2.5 points and challenged successfully by 3:0, thus Cho also becomes three-champion king (Meijin, Oza and Gosei).];W[dd];B[fc];W[hc];B[dp]
;W[oc];B[pp];W[pf]C[W8: White elects to play the big slant joseki.];B[od]C[B9 is a simple play.];W[pd];B[pe];W[pc];B[oe]LB[qe:a]C[B13: If Black connects at 'a', Black will cut at 13, the variation is complicated.];W[qe];B[qf];W[re]
;B[pg]TR[hc]C[Due to the existence of W4 (the marked stone), Black's play in the game is not bad.];W[mc];B[of]TR[dp][pp]C[Moreover, B5 and B7 already takes two corners, for Black to take sente in the upper-right corner is also not a bad choice.];W[rd];B[qn];W[jq];B[hq];W[mq];B[oq]LB[jo:a]
;W[cf]C[The original move of W26 is to strengthen at 'a'. In the game, Yoda wants to play more positively with W26, its value is indeed huge.];B[ko]LB[kp:a][lp:b]C[B27 is rarely seen. The common move is to strike at 'a' or 'b'.];W[hp]C[W28: White's sticking head this way is the only choice.];B[gq];W[ip];B[in];W[gp];B[fq];W[gn];B[dm]
;W[cq]C[The play of W36 should be reserved, since for White to dodge himself is urgent, striking the corner may impact that effort, the impact will be seen later.];B[cp];W[gl];B[il];W[pj]C[W40 is very big.];B[nj];W[qm]C[After the cap of B41, the attachment of W42 is common tesuji.];B[pm]C[Following B43, Black captures two white stones, but it is not to Black's advantage, it just fits White's intention.];W[pl];B[ql];W[rm]
;B[rn];W[rl];B[qk];W[pk];B[rj];W[qh];B[rk];W[om];B[pn];W[ph];B[rf];W[nh]C[After White jumps out with W58, White handles well this big group, Black in the upper-right corner appears thin, the roles of defense and offense are switched.];B[md]
;W[mk];B[mh];W[ni]LB[mo:a]TR[il][in][ko][cq]C[W62 is a simple move in a favorable situation, but I feel White should jump to 'a'. For White to connect two groups together is best, B27, B31 and B39 (the marked three stones) become weak right away, and White has no apprehension to ko-live W36 one stone.];B[mj];W[mi];B[lj];W[li];B[kj];W[ri]C[Yoda probably feels, up to W68, White becomes very thick, Black instead comes under attack and White can be satisfied.]
;B[lc];W[nd];B[me]LB[ne:a][nc:b][ld:c][le:d]C[The sequence following B71 perhaps is to Yoda's expectation. With B71 normally Black plays atari at 'a', next W 'b' and B 'c' or 'd'.];W[ld];B[le]C[In the game, the retreat of B71 is not especially surprising, but the play of B73 is really a surprise!];W[kd];B[ke]C[B73 sacrificing bravely is good feeling! Normally this kind of crude atari can't be played, but in the game it is surprisingly powerful.];W[jd]
;B[je];W[id];B[ki]C[Through B77, Black turns the head thickly with B79, forcing White to make life the big group.];W[qj];B[sm];W[lh];B[jg];W[rg];B[kr]C[Then Black takes sente and grabs the point of B85!];W[kq];B[lr];W[jr]
;B[mr];W[hn]TR[cq]C[Following B90, White has to escape, W36 (the marked white stone) dies unconditionally.];B[fm];W[hl];B[ik];W[jn];B[jo];W[im];B[jm];W[io];B[km];W[ek]
;B[ck]C[Black gets to play B101 and already achieves a big profit.];W[dc];B[cg]C[B103: Black continues two-prolonged attack.];W[df]LB[dg:a][dh:b]C[W104: I feel White should play hane at 'a', after B 'b', then White connects with W104.];B[dg];W[eg];B[eh];W[en];B[em];W[gm]
;B[bf];W[be];B[bg]C[Black gets to connect-and-hane with B111 and B113.];W[ef];B[dq]C[After Black grabs B115, Black's small victory can't be changed.];W[fh];B[sf]C[I feel the reason of Yoda's defeat is wrong situational judgement.];W[ei];B[ci];W[se];B[ae];W[bd]
