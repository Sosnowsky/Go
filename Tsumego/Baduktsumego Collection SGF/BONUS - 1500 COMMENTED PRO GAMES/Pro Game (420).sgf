;W[oc];B[md];W[mc];B[ce]LB[lc:a]C[B9: Black takes tenuki, it is a trend, the normal move is playing hane at 'a'.
];W[dg]LB[nd:a][ed:b]C[W10: White has state of mind to hang at 'a', locally there is no doubt White takes advantage, however Black gains speed by making the knight's move at 'b'.];B[lc];W[ld];B[kc];W[pe]

(;W[mb]LB[qe:a][nc:b][ob:c][nb:d]C[The stand of W16 is a novel move, the joseki is to block at 'a', next B 'b', W 'c' and B 'd' (see var a).

;W[jd];B[id];W[kf];B[fc]LB[pg:a][ed:b]C[B25: Black still should take tenuki and play hane at 'a', if White cuts, Black still can make the knight's move at 'b', here Black can make a lot of uses for other purpose, Black can fight.];W[ie];B[hd];W[pg]C[The sente extension of W28 is too big!];B[qh];W[de];B[mg]C[B31: Now Black's two stones are trying to escape, it is already not that important.]

;W[oj];B[qk];W[qg]LB[ok:a]C[W66 and W68 are mistakes, with W66 White should first push at 68, with W68 White should extend at 'a'.];B[ok]C[In the game, Black gets to hang at 69, White incurs a big loss!];W[ni]LB[nj:a]C[The tiger's move of W70 is again inexplicable!
