Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[pd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[qk]C[Lee Changho starts with "Chinese Fuseki", it is unexpected.]
;W[fq];B[fc]C[In my memory, he rarely uses this opening.];W[cf];B[jc];W[qf];B[qe];W[pf];B[nd];W[qi];B[oj];W[oh];B[ri]LB[rj:a][rh:b]C[The attachment of B17 is rarely seen, however in terms of result, it is not bad. Regardless whether White answers at 'a' or 'b' with W18, Black all seems to have taken advantage.]
;W[qj]C[W18: Therefore in the game, Gu Li elects to bump out and start fight.];B[rj];W[pk];B[qh]LB[ql:a][pj:b][pl:c][ok:d][ol:e][nk:f][op:g]C[B21: For Black to retreat at 'a' is perhaps more powerful, next W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 'e', W 'f' and B 'g', this way Black's side territory is not small.];W[ql]C[After being ataried by W22, Black is painful.];B[rk]
;W[ph];B[pl];W[ok];B[pj]C[And the fight following B27 is inevitable.];W[pi];B[nj];W[pm];B[ol];W[nk];B[mk];W[nl];B[om];W[ml]
;B[qm];W[mj];B[ni];W[lk]C[White first takes one stone and can fight adequately.];B[mi];W[ne]C[The attachment of W42 is tight.];B[me]LB[ki:a]C[B43: For Black to simply jump at 'a' is the original move.];W[mf];B[oe]C[B43 and B45 are correct moves.];W[li]
;B[mh]C[When W46, Black can only turn inconveniently, it is too painful!];W[lh];B[mg];W[nf]C[Following W50, White takes chance and pushes out.];B[lg];W[md];B[kj];W[lj];B[le];W[lf];B[kg];W[kf]
;B[ld];W[mc];B[lc];W[jf];B[jg];W[ic]C[The attachment of W64 again is good move!];B[of]LB[if:a]C[Since Black is very heavy in the center, White at around 'a' is all sente.];W[ng];B[hg]C[Black can't play freely and can only jump out with B67.];W[jd];B[nc]
;W[gd]C[White plays hane of W68 in sente, then makes the knight of W70, White is clearly favorable.];B[ij];W[jl];B[il];W[ik]C[The wedge of W74 is also good move!];B[hk];W[jk]C[In this kind of places, Gu Li is very sharp.];B[gj];W[hl]C[W78 takes one stone in sente, White is thick.];B[gl];W[im]
;B[gn];W[fd]LB[re:a][rd:b][pe:c][qd:d][og:e]C[But W82 is a little slow, White should first play hane at 'a', next if Black blocks at 'b', then W 'c' and B 'd', this way White already reinforces the defect at 'e', it makes a big difference in points!];B[og];W[nh];B[pg];W[qc]C[W86: Perhaps Gu Li thinks there is still a loop hole in the corner.];B[ob]C[But the diagonal of B87 is good move! White gains nothing, as a result, Black catches up a little in territory.]
;W[di];B[fh];W[hi];B[ii];W[ig]C[W90 and W92 again are good moves.];B[ih]C[Black's big group is still not alive.];W[if]C[White may form territory on the left side.];B[jh];W[dl];B[ej];W[gg];B[hh]
;W[fk];B[gk];W[ei];B[fi];W[ek]LB[dj:a]C[W104: After study, we think for White to block at 'a' is better, if Black captures W100 and makes life, Black will be too inconvenient.];B[ho];W[ip];B[dj]LB[fj:a]C[When B107, White still wants to cut at 'a'.];W[cj]C[If proceeding like this, with W104 for White to block at 107 is indeed better.]
;B[fj];W[ck];B[dk];W[el];B[ci];W[ch];B[bi];W[bh];B[en];W[bj]C[However, through W118, White's aji is not good, but Black also gains not much, the situation is still to White's advantage.];B[io];W[jp];B[jo]
;W[ko];B[dh];W[ai];B[hp];W[kp];B[gq];W[fp];B[fm];W[dn];B[cq];W[cp];B[bp];W[hm]LB[bo:a]C[W134 is not simple and clear enough. In fact to answer at 'a' is very good, if Black wants to live the corner, then White can play W124, Black's big group is not alive.]
;B[cn]C[Being clamped by B135, White is a little painful!];W[bo]LB[do:a]C[W136: But White's sequence following W136 is very questionable. Since White already plays W134, White should connect at 'a' with W136! See whether Black dares take tenuki and make life the corner? White should have this courage.];B[do];W[co];B[dm];W[cl];B[fo]C[In the game, Black takes advantage, and the corner is still not clean. White clearly incurs loss.];W[gp]C[Following W142, White wants to kill.];B[hq];W[fr]
;B[jr];W[kr];B[gf];W[ff];B[hf]LB[hc:a]C[But in the process, after the exchange of B147 and B149, Black's clamp at 'a' is effective.];W[fg];B[iq];W[pp]C[When B151, White again dares not continue to chase and kill, White's play is not consistent.];B[hc];W[hd];B[ib]
;W[id];B[br]C[The tiger's move of B157 is early preserved tactic.];W[qq];B[lr];W[oq];B[hb];W[kq];B[ks];W[bn]LB[ap:a]C[White has no assurance of success if playing atari at 'a', allowing Black to make life.];B[ap]LB[cm:a]C[But Black directly reinforces the big group, since B 'a' is sente, Black got one gote eye, this way Black gains a lot.]
;W[gc];B[gb]C[The situation is still very close, but Black is already a little favorable.];W[fb];B[fa];W[ec];B[ea];W[re];B[qd];W[rd];B[qb];W[rh];B[qg];W[rg]
