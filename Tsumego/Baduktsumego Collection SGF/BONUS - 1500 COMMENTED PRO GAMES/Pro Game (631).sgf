;B[ch];W[nc]LB[kd:a]C[If W8 approaches the corner with the small knight's move, I plan to pincer at 'a'.];B[pc];W[kc];B[co];W[jq];B[hq];W[op]LB[pn:a]C[It is very difficult to select where to play W14, the large knight's move at 'a' can also be considered.];B[qp]LB[qk:a][qm:b]C[If B15 extends to 'a', White's forcing move at 'b' is huge.]
;W[pp];B[qo];W[rq];B[ql]LB[pk:a][qm:b][pm:c]C[B19 making two-spance extension is heavy, it should make a large extension to 'a',  if White invades at 'b', Black can attach at 'c' exquisitely.];W[qj];B[qg];W[ok];B[om];W[pn]TR[qp][qo]LB[qk:a][rl:b][ml:c]C[W24 capturing two black stones is pointless, White's corner is very thick, White should attack Black on a large scale, like butting at 'a', if Black stands at 'b', W 'c' attacking with the knight's move is the proper play.]
;B[on];W[qn];B[pm]C[B25 and B27 sacrificing two stones are smart plays.];W[rn];B[ml]C[Black gets to make the knight's move of 29, whole board's configuration for Black is not bad.];W[lp];B[mj];W[ph]LB[rl:a][ic:b]C[If W32 crosses over at 'a', Black can invade at 'b', White is not satisfied.];B[qh];W[qi]
;B[pg]LB[oi:a][pi:b][oj:c]C[The turn of B35 is a wrong direction, it should strike at 'a', after W 'b' connects, Black can bump at 'c', this is clearly better than the real game.];W[ni]LB[oh:a][oj:b]C[W36 is a good move! if W36 extends to 'a', Black can play at 'b' and make a nice shape.];B[oh];W[oi];B[pi];W[pj];B[rk]
;W[nh];B[mo];W[lo];B[kd]C[The attachment of B45 aims to initiate a two-pronged fight.];W[ld];B[le];W[lh]C[W48 avoids more tangles at the top and is a clever play.];B[jc];W[lc];B[ke];W[jb];B[ic]
;W[ib];B[jh]LB[nj:a][og:b][ph:c][oj:d][of:e]C[The cap of B55 may accomplish nothing, it should first probe White by pushing through at 'a', if White ataris at 'b', B 'c' connects, W 'd' connects, Black can reinforce at 'e' and Black is thick.  When B 'a' pushes, if Black simply connects, later on the atari at 'b' becomes light.];W[lk]LB[ln:a][og:b]C[W56 is careless!  it helps Black to play the good move at 'a'. W56 should atari at 'b'.];B[ln];W[kn]LB[mk:a][mp:b][mq:c]C[The hane of W58 is also a bad move! now it can only steadily thrust at 'a', followed by B 'b' and W 'c'.]
;B[km];W[jn];B[jm];W[in];B[nj];W[og];B[ph];W[oj];B[of];W[ki];B[im];W[ji]LB[lm:a][ll:b][mn:c][mm:d]C[W70 has to atari at 'a' first, followed by Black's atari at 'b', White's capturing at 'c', Black's atari at 'd', then White attaches out with 70, this way the big group in the center is painful, but White has gained a lot by taking one stone, White can only fight desperately like this in order to win the game.]
;B[hn]C[In the game, White extends three stones but still gets haned at the head by B71, White has obviously suffered a big loss.];W[lm];B[mn];W[ll];B[hm];W[nl]LB[rj:a][lj:b]C[If W76 blocks at 'a', Black can push at 'b', White is no good.];B[mp];W[lq];B[ri]C[Black gets to hane at 79, Black becomes favored instantly.];W[di]
;B[ci];W[dk];B[dj];W[ej];B[cj];W[em]LB[fl:a]C[W86 nomally can only knight at 'a'. Because the game is not to White's advantage, W86 seeks to wreck more Black's territory.];B[mq];W[hr];B[gr]LB[iq:a][ir:b][jp:c]C[B89 hitting at 'a' is better, if W 'b' blocks, Black can hane at 'c'. In the game,  the way for White to settle the shape is a little vulgar, but very practical.]

;B[gc];W[hb];B[fl];W[fk];B[el];W[ek];B[fd]C[The wedge and atari of B109 is the winning move.];W[ge];B[fe];W[fc];B[gf];W[he];B[gj]TR[gf]C[With addition of the marked atari move, B115 delievers the fatal blow! White is dangerous.]
;W[ff];B[fi]C[After the diagonal of B117 captures several White's stones, Black already has a big victory.];W[df];B[fg];W[cf];B[ef];W[be];B[dg];W[de];B[mm];W[mk];B[ie];W[hf]
