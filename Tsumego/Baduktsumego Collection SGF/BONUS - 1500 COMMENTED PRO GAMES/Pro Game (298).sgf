;W[gq];B[fc];W[cf];B[jd];W[qf];B[qe]LB[re:a]C[The diagonal's extension of B11 is an usual move, for Black to make the knight's move at 'a' is also playable.];W[pf];B[nd];W[qi];B[ph]LB[oj:a][oi:b][ni:c][oh:d][nj:e][mg:f]C[B15: The usual play for Black is making the knight's move at 'a', then W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 'e' and W 'f', both sides are stable. In the game, after B15, then Black makes the knight's move at 'a', which is an attack posture.]
;W[qh];B[oj];W[nh]TR[ph]LB[oi:a]C[W18: Due to the addition of the marked black stone, White can no longer play at 'a'.];B[oh]C[B19: Black is eager to fight.];W[nf];B[ni];W[mh];B[mi];W[lh];B[kj]
;W[jh];B[rf]C[The hane and connect of B27 is very big, and Black is still aiming to attack this white's group.];W[rg];B[re];W[md];B[mc];W[lc]C[The double hane of W30 and W32 are good moves! After the hane of W30, it is meaningless if White doesn't make a double hane.]
(;B[me]LB[ld:a][kc:b][nc:c][lb:d][mb:e][oe:f][of:g]C[B33: Black faces with two choices, one is to atari as in the game; the other is to atari at 'a', W33, B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f', W 'g' and B32 (see var a), this way although Black would have ensured the corner territory, but the aji is not good. The real reason of the play in the game is that, because White's big group outside is still not alive, by the atari, attack-type player Song TaeKon obviously still wants to put more importance on attack.];W[ld];B[ne];W[nc];B[le];W[oc];B[pc]
;W[jb]C[But after W40, Black has incurred a big loss in territory, now Black must make profits by attacking White's big group, otherwise the early loss would be too big.];B[kg]LB[ng:a]C[B41: Black prepares to wedge at 'a'.];W[rk]C[W42 is a good move! This is the winning move of the game, Black aims to sacrifice.];B[rl];W[ql]C[W44 is clever! Treating the stones at the top lightly, White turns around wonderfully.];B[pk]C[B45 is a very bad move! Locally the worst move has just been selected by Song TaeKon! It is the losing move!];W[rm]C[With the atari of W46, White lives in sente.];B[rj];W[sl]
;B[qj];W[li];B[lj];W[ji]LB[lf:a][ik:b]C[Then White pushes at 50 and doubles up at 52, after leaving the aji of connection at 'a', White makes the knight's move at 'b', the game for Black is as good as lost!];B[ng];W[mf];B[mg];W[lg];B[og];W[ik]TR[pk]LB[pl:a]C[Now Black has only about 30 points in the upper right corner, but White's territory on the board is more than Black's, besides, White still have such a big territory potential. Black is in a losing situation very early, it is indeed unexpected! In retrospect, no matter what the marked black stone should be either at 'a' or 47, in the game White easily has given up the burden, Black is certainly no good.]

;W[ec];B[fd];W[ej];B[lf];W[el]C[After White takes a big lead, W76 is just an attack posture, because now White only needs to make himself thicker by attacking, White's victory can't be changed.];B[gn];W[fo];B[em];W[dl];B[gl];W[hm];B[gm];W[gj]
;B[cl];W[sj]C[W86 is alert.];B[ri]LB[si:a]C[B87 is extremely painful! Surprisingly Black dares not to atari at 'a'! Otherwise White will start a ko at 87, because White is thick on the board, Black has no way to win the ko fight.];W[si];B[sh];W[sk];B[rh];W[ip];B[kq];W[oq]LB[ef:a]C[The striking move of W94 is going too far, now White should simply jump to 'a' to ensure his victory easily.]
;B[pp];W[pr];B[qr];W[nr];B[im];W[in];B[il];W[ef]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.];B[bi];W[bh];B[hh];W[hk];B[hl]

;B[ei];W[hg];B[cj];W[ch];B[dj];W[gh];B[ic];W[lp]LB[mq:a]C[In the game, Black seems to be confused mentally, after making a sequence of moves that can't judged as either good or bad, in the end White unexpected obtains sente, White gets the chance to play at 128 and attack Black instead! It is simply amazing, why Black doesn't attack at 'a' first ?];B[fq];W[fp];B[iq];W[hq]
