;B[cn]LB[cj:a][qh:b]C[B7: Black elects to approach from this side, it is interesting, to split at 'a' or check at 'b' is often seen.];W[dk];B[cq];W[cp];B[dq];W[ep];B[bp];W[bo];B[bq];W[co];B[fq]
;W[qg];B[cf];W[df]LB[ce:a][fd:b][ci:c]C[The press of W20 is invented by Korean players, in the past Japanese always like to make the diagonal's hit to attack, then Black extends at 20, White jumps to 'b' and B 'c'. However now people think that White is a little loose this way, from this move we can see Yamashita's acknowledge about Korean Baduk.];B[de];W[ee];B[ce]LB[dg:a]C[The wedge and connect of B21 and B23 are a special play when the ladder is favorable, normally Black will hane at 'a', then White will hang at 23, this configuration is to White's advantage.];W[cd];B[ed]C[The block of W24 and the cut of B25 are inevitable.]
;W[ef]C[The connection of W26 is the proper move.];B[ec];W[bd]C[White descends with W28, it is the right shape and can't be missed.];B[cg]LB[ch:a]C[Black simply extends with B29, it is a thick play, if jumping to 'a', Black is a little thin.];W[dc]C[White turns with W30, which is the vital point for securing a base.];B[eb]C[B31: Black makes the exchange with sente and is alert.];W[db];B[cj]LB[ci:a]C[Black tenukis on the upper side and makes the extension with B33, which is necessary and the most urgent point, now Black can't continue to answer at the top, if being checked by White at 'a', Black would be too passive.]
;W[dj]C[The answer of W34 takes White a lot of thinking, pressing from the top is seeking to obtain influence.];B[ck];W[ci];B[bi];W[di];B[ch];W[cl];B[bl];W[bm];B[bk]C[The sequence from B35 to B43 is a clever tactic of making sabaki plays, representing Yoda's strategy, Black also has gained some territory.];W[gc]C[The checking move of W44 is also a valuable move.];B[eh]
;W[ge];B[cm];W[dl];B[em];W[dm];B[dn];W[en];B[fn];W[eo];B[bn];W[fm]C[With the sequence from B45 to W56, Black has some gains in territory, but White itself also becomes much safer.];B[ic];W[hb]
;B[gf];W[fe];B[fl];W[el];B[gm]C[B61 and B63 are strong moves of Yoda's bold and resolute style.];W[fk]C[White counterattacks with W64 and is not willing to fall behind, to connect and eliminate the ko is not a move from the Kisei!];B[em];W[ao];B[am];W[fm];B[pj];W[gl]C[When Black plays the ko threat of B69, White makes a ponnuki with W70, it is of momentum, White is already reluctant to answer here.]
;B[qi]C[The hane of B71 is inevitable.
];W[rj]C[The descent of W72 is an excellent way of settling the shape, which is worth remembering, reinforcing yourself when the opponent is stronger is the right strategy at this moment.];B[qh];W[pk];B[oj];W[qn];B[ok];W[pl];B[pg]C[After B79, the game was closed for the first day.

It is a situation of Black's territory versus White's thickness, the game is still too early, later on, how to obtain territory by using the thickness is White's main task.];W[mc]C[White checks tightly with W80, which is a move of strength and fight, representing Yamashita's fighting will.];B[he]
;W[le];B[kf]C[The hane of B81 and the shoulder-hit of B83 is a way of seeking tempo.];W[ke];B[jf];W[lf];B[lg];W[pf];B[og];W[of];B[nf];W[ne];B[mg];W[od]C[The selection of W84 to the tiger's move of W94 is very substantial, showing Yamashita's straightforward character.]
;B[pc];W[nc];B[hc];W[gb]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.

Through W98, although Black has incurred some losses in territory, but Black is able to make himself thick with sente, nullifying White's thickness in the lower left and keeping balance on the whole board.];B[ro]C[Being able to come back and play at 99, from the game's process, it seems Black is still not bad.];W[rn];B[qo];W[mq]C[The large knight's move of W102 is a clever move, if White continues to answer, White's territory may be not enough.];B[pn];W[rl];B[qm];W[rm]
;B[kq]C[The forcing move of B107 is much better than a move in the corner.];W[pr];B[nm];W[oq]LB[nr:a]C[The knight's move of B109 is full of murderous intentions, aiming to strike at 'a' next.];B[pm];W[ql];B[qr];W[oo]C[The peep of W1114 is perfect timing.];B[op];W[np];B[no]
;W[mo];B[nn];W[nr]C[W120 is the proper move, here Black is thick, White has to choose to make life himself first.];B[ri];W[sj]C[So far, it becomes a close game, the outcome will be probably decided in the endgame.];B[hk];W[hl];B[jk]C[Black plays in the middle with B123 and B125, it is Yoda's good judgement, the size of moyo in the center will directly affect the outcome of game.];W[hq];B[gr];W[re];B[rd]
;W[qq];B[lp];W[mp];B[kn];W[hi];B[ji];W[mf];B[ng];W[hr]C[Through the block of W138, it becomes a very close game, the outcome is still hard to decide.];B[fp]C[With the sequence after B139, Black settles shape in order to make himself all thick.];W[fo];B[gp]
;W[jp];B[kp];W[in];B[go];W[ln];B[jo];W[io];B[ip];W[hp];B[jq];W[ho];B[lm];W[gn]C[After White takes with W154, the local exchange comes to an end, both sides have some gains.]
;B[eq]C[Black connects with B155, preventing White from striking inside, it is a 6-point counter-sente endgame move.];W[hg];B[hf];W[je];B[if];W[jl];B[kl];W[jm];B[km];W[qe];B[nb];W[mb];B[ob]
;W[rp]C[After grabbing the big endgame of W168, White is slightly favorable in the game.];B[be];W[ib];B[ad];W[ac];B[ae];W[bb];B[jc];W[hd];B[id];W[gd];B[ie];W[jb]
