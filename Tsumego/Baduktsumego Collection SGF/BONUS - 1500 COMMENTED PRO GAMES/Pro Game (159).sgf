Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[pd];W[dc];B[pq];W[dq];B[de]C[B5: Seo Bongsoo (White) elects to start with ancient two-small-point opening and plays very quickly. It seems he already have prepared for it.]
;W[cg];B[cc];W[cb];B[cd];W[gc];B[eg];W[dg];B[bb]C[The play of B13 was not seen before, Chang Hao 9p seems to have studied it.];W[ef];B[eb];W[ee];B[db]C[Through B17, Black gains a lot of territory.]
;W[po];B[qo];W[pp];B[qp];W[oq];B[qn];W[pr];B[qq];W[jp]C[W26: White forms a huge moyo.];B[cn];W[cl];B[dl]C[B29: Black starts to reduce. Now it forms a situation of Black's territory vs. White's moyo.]
;W[ck]C[W30 is calm and correct move.];B[cq]C[B31 is not a good move, I think. Next White can extend to star point. Seo Bongsoo is pondering.];W[dp];B[cp];W[do];B[dn];W[co];B[bo];W[bp];B[bq];W[bn];B[ap]
;W[en]LB[bm:a]C[W42: The situation is very complicated, but White didn't hesitate at all. But White may want to play at 'a' and try to attack Black with W42.];B[bm];W[dm];B[cm];W[em]C[W46: Black lives in four corners, White forms thickness in the center. Generally players like to take Black in this situation, since Black is easier to play.];B[lq]C[As to invasion of B47, White is very painful.];W[mp]C[W48 is the strongest response.];B[jq]C[B49: If White plays hane, Black wants to crosscut?];W[iq];B[ip]C[B51: Black also responds very strongly, what's next for White?]
;W[jo]C[W52: White extends to the center.];B[hq];W[ir];B[hr]C[
];W[jr];B[fo]LB[hp:a]C[The peep of B57 is very sharp. White is very difficult to respond. With W56 for White to cut at 'a' first may be better.];W[hp]C[Now White has no other choice but to cut with W58. ];B[eo];W[gp];B[eq]C[B61: Black captures four white stones, Black is way ahead in territory, how much territory White can enclose in the center? ]
;W[bl];B[an];W[fq];B[dr]C[B65 is a simple move, meaning Black can be satisfied.];W[qf];B[nc]C[B67: Black responds steadily. Chang Hao judges his situation is favorable, so he starts to play simple moves.];W[rd];B[op]C[B69 is an asking move.];W[nq];B[qc];W[qi];B[jd]C[B73: If proceeding normally, White's territory is not enough.]
;W[gn]C[W74 is strong move, but its aji is not good. If White wants to cap this way, White shouldn't exchange W64 and B65.];B[fg]C[B75: What's the purpose of this move? It is unexpected and very positive move.

After this move, it is time for noon break.];W[gf];B[di];W[ci];B[dj]C[B79: Black condenses White on the left side at maximum limit.];W[cj];B[fi]C[B81 is very steady move. ];W[lc]C[W82: White invades quickly, this is the key fight of this game. Chang Hao is pondering.];B[ff]C[W83 is very strong move.

;W[fe];B[ge];W[id];B[hf]C[B87: Black simply plays atari, now Black is favorable in ladder.];W[jc];B[rc]C[B89: After handling the situation simply, Black plays the big point. This way it will be a long game. The first feeling of White's next move is to make two-space extension on the right side.];W[ql];B[qr];W[er];B[ep]C[Now all side and corner's shapes are basically settled, only the center is still open. White catches up a lot in territory, but Black also becomes thick.];W[on]C[W94: White encloses territory and also serves as ladder breaker.]
;B[hd]C[B95 prevents White from escaping W76 and also condenses White at top. Seo Bongsoo enters into overtime.];W[gd]C[B96 is difficult to understand.];B[ie];W[ic];B[gg]C[B99: Black eliminates all the aji completely.];W[kd]C[W100: White fixes shape calmly.];B[pl]C[B101: Black starts to play in center. Now Black is slightly leading in territory, the key is how much territory White can enclose at bottom.];W[qk];B[om]C[B103 is steady move.];W[nn]
;B[pn];W[oo]C[W106: The game slowly enters into the second half. Black's play at top and left-center appears slow.];B[nm];W[mn];B[rf]C[B109: Black plays endgame alertly.];W[rg];B[re];W[qe];B[qd];W[sf];B[sd];W[oj]LB[or:a]C[The play of W116 is very efficient. Now the biggest move is capturing one white stone at 'a', worth 12 points.]
;B[bf];W[bg];B[or];W[nr];B[ps];W[fk]C[W122 is both offensive and defensive move, so far Seo Bongsoo 9p plays very well.];B[go];W[hn];B[gk];W[gl];B[gj];W[hl]C[W128: Black is still favorable for the game. Looking back, W122 at 127 is better.]
;B[ns];W[mr];B[mb];W[ij]C[W132 is good move.];B[je];W[qm];B[pm];W[ih]C[W136: White forces Black to make life.];B[ke];W[lb]C[W138: Under time pressure, Seo Bongsoo plays this move in a hurry.];B[ll];W[le]
;B[lf];W[me]C[W142 is thick play, White is waiting for chances.];B[fr];W[gr];B[es];W[lm]C[W146: Black takes endgame advantage one at a time, White continues to play thickness.];B[ji];W[jj];B[ii];W[ki]C[W150: White's center becomes bigger.];B[kh];W[li]C[W152 is not bad and kind of sente.]
;B[lh];W[hi];B[jh];W[hj];B[mk];W[kl];B[mi];W[kk];B[gs];W[gq];B[hs];W[is];B[fs]
;W[fb];B[ms];W[ls];B[os];W[lr]C[W170: The situation is still very close, Black is slightly favorable.];B[rm];W[rl];B[sn]C[B173 is the biggest endgame on the board and Black also aims at White's weak point.];W[ec];B[pk];W[pj];B[ph]
;W[pg]C[W178 is the strongest response. If Black has enough ko threats, Black can also counterattack.];B[oh];W[qh];B[rj];W[qj];B[og]C[B183 forces White to live, Black takes some endgame advantage.];W[nf];B[of];W[oe];B[pe];W[ri];B[hh]
;W[ob]C[W190: This move is not working.];B[md]C[B191 is very clever move.];W[ld];B[nb];W[nd];B[oc];W[be];B[cf];W[af];B[bd];W[ea];B[ca]
;W[dk];B[fj];W[ek]C[W204: Black is leading 10 points on the board.];B[ho];W[io];B[dh]C[The game 2 will take place on 12/7.])
