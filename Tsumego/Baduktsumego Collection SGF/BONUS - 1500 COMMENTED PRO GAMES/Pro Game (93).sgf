Due to the SARS, now we almost can only comment on the foreign Go games, hope this unusual time will pass as soon as possible.];B[pd]C[This is the last game before the final of the 37th Korean Paewang. Yoo Changhyeok stopped Yoon SeongHuyun from advancing to the final, the latter eliminated Lee Sedol 7p earlier. The final then will take place between two old opponents Lee Changho and Yoo Changhyeok, this is also the first final series  match between them in almost two years.];W[dc];B[qp];W[dp];B[oq]
;W[qj];B[ce];W[ch]C[W8: The two-space lower pincer is seldom seen.];B[cn]C[B9: Black probes White and then decides how to answer at the top.];W[dl];B[gc];W[de];B[cd];W[cc];B[jc]LB[cg:a]C[The two-space extension of B15 is a steady move, not sure whether it is due to the reason that the opponent is "#1 attacker", in fact fighting with the attachment at 'a' is also very powerful.];W[dd]

(;B[ld]LB[qc:a][kd:b][kc:c][lc:d][mc:e]C[B25: If Black enters the corner at 'a', then W 'b', B 'c' and W 'd', because of an unfavorable ladder, Black couldn't cut at 25 and can only make the diagonal's extension at 'e', this way White would take advantage in sente with the connection of W25 (see var a).];W[pc]LB[qc:a][qg:b]C[W26 is unnecessary, White should simply make the diagonal's extension at 'a', although the block of B26 is sente, but diagonal-strengthening at 'b' is also valuable.];B[qc];W[qd];B[oc];W[pb]

;W[co];B[rh]C[B43 is a huge move.];W[ni];B[pj];W[jq];B[dn];W[fp];B[cq]TR[cn][dn]LB[cf:a][bc:b]C[It is flexible for Black to enter the corner with B49! If Black simply runs out the two marked stones, while being under attack, the tactic of B 'a' and B 'b' may dissappear.];W[bo]
;B[eq];W[ep];B[fq];W[dq];B[dr];W[cr];B[br];W[gq]LB[cf:a][bc:b]C[Through 58, Black's corner makes life in sente and then Black initiates the ko at 'a' and 'b', this is Black's expected result.];B[cf];W[eg];B[bc]
;W[bb];B[ab];W[bd];B[ad];W[ac];B[cj];W[ae]C[Black uses the invasion of B67 as a ko threat, White has no good answer and it is also not easy to handle very cleanly, so White elects to simply eliminate the ko.];B[ej];W[fl];B[dh];W[dg];B[eh]C[B71 and B73 are good moves.]
;W[dk]LB[fg:a][bl:b]C[W74: If White extends to 'a', then Black would make the knight's move at 'b', White has no good maneuver for attacking.];B[dj];W[bk];B[fg]C[Black gets to hane at 77 and can be satisfied.];W[li]LB[mq:a]C[W78 seems a little conservative, White should make the two-space extension at 'a', this is the last big point on the board.];B[lq]C[After Black's extension of B79, Black is slightly favorable for the game.];W[gr];B[cs]
;W[np];B[nq];W[lp];B[kp];W[kq];B[mp]C[Usually B85 and B87 are not playable, but in the current situation, it can be considered as a simple and easy play.];W[lo];B[mo];W[ln];B[mn];W[lr];B[mq];W[lm]
;B[hj];W[nl]C[W96: White has no assurance of success for a territory race.];B[ki]LB[hl:a][gk:b]C[B97: If Black directly jumps to 'a', White concerns that Black White may cut at 'a'.];W[kh];B[ji];W[hl]LB[lj:a][mm:b]C[W100: If White extends to 'a', then it is not a problem any more for Black to jump to 100.

White not only has obtained some points but also gained eye shape.];B[qm]LB[jo:a]C[B119: If Black makes the diagonal's extension at 'a' to capture the four white stones, then White would hane at 119, Black has no certainty of winning for this exchange.];W[in];B[im];W[hn];B[ll];W[jn];B[kn];W[ko]
;B[km];W[jo];B[om]LB[mk:a][nk:b][oj:c]C[B129: Black should first exchange B 'a' and W 'b', later on hit W 'c' to reduce one liberty, this would directly affect the outcome of the game.];W[le];B[md];W[je];B[mk];W[oj];B[ng];W[mg]

;B[gk];W[gl];B[il]LB[fb:a]C[B151 is the losing move! The center territory is small, Black should make the diagonal's extension at 'a', this way the game would be very close.];W[pm];B[pn];W[rj];B[rk];W[mr];B[nr];W[kj];B[lk];W[ff]
