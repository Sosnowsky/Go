;W[qo]LB[po:a]C[W6: For White to play the high approach at 'a' is also possible.];B[ld]LB[pe:a]C[B7: For Black to play at 'a' is steady, but now the komi is 6.5, 
so Black elects to play the pincer-attack positively.];W[qi]LB[of:a][nd:b]C[W8 is rarely seen, usually White will jump to 'a' or make the diagonal's extension at 'b'.];B[pc]LB[pe:a]C[B9 prevents White from pressing with the knight's move at 'a'.];W[np]TR[qi]C[W10 is a correlated conception with the marked white stone.]
;B[op]LB[po:a]C[B11: If Black presses out at 'a', it would lead to the great slant joseki, Black is reluctant to take a risk.];W[oo];B[nq];W[mp];B[mq];W[lp];B[lq];W[kp];B[jq]C[Through 19, it is a common joseki.];W[qq]LB[po:a][pn:b][pp:c][on:d][qn:e]C[W20: White aims to settle the shape immediately, if White takes tenuki, Black will wedge at 'a', then W 'b' and B 'c', next White is hard to decide whether to strengthen at 'd' or 'e'.]
;B[qg];W[oi];B[ce];W[dh];B[hc]C[B25: Black plays the counter-pincer, considering his configuration in the upper right.];W[cd];B[de];W[fc];B[ge];W[dk];B[po]LB[qp:a][rp:b][pp:c][oq:d][pr:e]C[B31 is a play to obtain sente, if White plays the wedge at 'a', then W 'b', B 'c' and W31, Black will end in gote, furthermore, if B31 is omitted, then after W 'c' and B 'd', the hane of W 'e' is kind of sente.]
;W[pn];B[pp];W[qp];B[on];W[no];B[pr];W[pm]C[Through W38, although Black has obtained sente, but White on the right side has also strengthened.];B[cm]C[B39 is a good point which can't be let slip.];W[em]C[W40 has a good relation with White's outside influence on the right side.];B[og]C[B41 is related to moyo's expansion and reduction of both sides, White has no assurance of success for a territory race. Forcing White to invade and taking initiative while attacking is Black's right strategy.];W[pb]
;B[qb];W[pd];B[qc];W[jc];B[eb]C[B47 is good order.];W[ec]LB[fb:a][dd:b]C[W48: If White blocks at 'a', then B 'b', White is no good.];B[jd];W[fe];B[kc];W[ff]C[As for the result up to W52, Black has nothing to complain.]
;B[cj]C[B53 is sharp, White has no good counterattack maneuver.];W[cg]C[W54 is the original move.];B[ck]C[Through B55, Black can be satisfied.];W[cn];B[co];W[dn];B[bn];W[ep];B[dq];W[bm];B[bl];W[eq]
;B[bp]LB[eo:a]C[B65: Black first strengthens himself and later on tries to find a chance to play the hane at 'a'.];W[mc];B[lb];W[ng]C[W68 is a very bold thinking.];B[nf];W[mg];B[oh];W[ni];B[mf];W[io]C[Through W74, White's moyo in the center is very considerable, how Black to reduce is the key for this game.];B[eo]
;W[fo];B[fn];W[en];B[do];W[go];B[ki]C[B81 is a proper point.];W[kg];B[mi];W[nh]C[The exchange of B83 with W84 is no good, Black not only loses the push at 84 also reduces his own liberties.];B[ii]C[The time both sides has used is very close, about 50 minutes.];W[lf]C[After W86, the aji in Black's territory is very bad.]
;B[ri]C[B87: Black wants to take advantage in sente.];W[of]C[The timing of W88 is excellent.];B[oe];W[pf];B[pe];W[qh];B[qf];W[rh]C[Through W94, Black has clearly incurred some losses.];B[lh];W[le];B[me];W[lg]
;B[lk]C[After B99, Black is still leading in territory, in order to win, White needs to enclose the center territory at the maximum limit by attacking Black.];W[ik];B[gi];W[gk];B[ei];W[jb]C[W104 is a good endgame.];B[ic];W[md];B[ne];W[gb];B[el];W[lc]
;B[kd];W[kb];B[mb];W[ib];B[nc]C[Through B115, White has gained a big profit.];W[fm];B[eg]LB[fh:a]C[B117 is a good timing, otherwise White will peep at 'a'.];W[ef];B[bh];W[bg];B[dg]
;W[df];B[ch];W[cf]C[Through W124, Black takes advantage in sente.];B[qr]C[B125 is a big endgame.];W[rr];B[rs];W[rq];B[rg]C[B129 is kind of counter-sente.];W[hh];B[ij];W[jk];B[gj]
;W[fk];B[sh];W[rj];B[si];W[bo]C[W138 is clearly played under the time pressure in overtime.];B[ao];W[nk];B[hb];W[ha];B[gc];W[fb];B[mk];W[nl]
;B[kl];W[jh];B[kj];W[di];B[dj];W[eh];B[ej];W[he];B[gd];W[gf];B[ie]C[From W150 to B157, White captures two black stones in sente and can be satisfied.];W[ir];B[jr]
;W[er]C[W160 is worth study.];B[hr];W[iq];B[hq];W[ip];B[is]C[Through B165, Black can be satisfied.];W[sj];B[sg];W[qj]C[W168 is big.];B[dr];W[ph]LB[gq:a]C[W170 is unnecessary, White should strengthen at 'a'.]
;B[fl]C[B171 is a brilliant move.];W[gl];B[fp];W[gp]LB[gq:a]C[If W174 at 'a', then Black will play at 174, White can't look after both the upper and lower side.];B[fq];W[gq];B[fr];W[gr];B[es];W[pg]C[Through W180, White has incurred a small loss in the exchange.];B[hf]C[The endgame of B181 is worth 7 points in gote, now it is a half point game and Black is slightly better.]
