;W[cn];B[fc]C[With the approaching moves of B5 and B7, Black seeks speed.];W[hc]LB[cf:a][df:b]C[W8: If White defends the corner at 'a' or 'b', Black may play the "Chinese Fuseki".];B[jp];W[qn];B[qp];W[qk];B[cc]LB[po:a]C[B13 is a territory-oriented move, fitting Kobayashi's style, if continuing to adopt fast speed play, B11 perhaps should be played as the jump move at 'a'.];W[dc]
;B[cd];W[de];B[db];W[eb];B[cb];W[ec];B[cf];W[nc];B[qf];W[qh]C[White first approaches the corner with W22 then makes the two-space extension with W24, it is a good sequence, if White simply makes the extension with W24, Black will defend the corner with a good move at 22.];B[pb];W[hq];B[hp]
;W[ip];B[iq]LB[io:a][gp:b][jq:c][kp:d][lq:e]C[B29 is the right move, if Black plays the atari at 'a', then W29, B 'b', W 'c', B 'd' and W 'e', Black has not only incurred some losses in points and Black's outside is not thick either, Black is clearly no good.];W[io];B[hr];W[jq];B[gq];W[ir];B[hq]
;W[kp]LB[pl:a]C[W36: Although White can capture one stone in the ladder, but Black has the tactic of playing the ladder breaker at 'a'.];B[pl];W[nl]LB[jo:a][ql:b]C[Here W38 is a good move! if White directly takes at 'a', then B 'b', White has no follow up maneuver.];B[ql];W[pk];B[ol];W[ok];B[nm];W[mm]
;B[on];W[nn];B[om];W[dr]C[Through the jump of W48, the losses and gains for both sides are about equal.];B[id]LB[jc:a]C[The shoulder-hit of B49 is unexpected, the usual play is to pincer at 'a'.];W[hd];B[ie];W[jb];B[he];W[kr];B[gn]

;B[ln];W[kk]LB[lj:a][mk:b][mj:c][mp:d][lp:e][lq:f][mq:g][mr:h][kj:i]C[W70 is clearly unreasonable, to make the knight's move at 'a' would be more steady, followed by B 'b', W 'c', B70 and W 'd', the if Black still plays at 'e', then W 'f', B 'g' and W 'h', after taking sente, White can press at 'i', this variation is obviously better than the real game.];B[mk];W[mj];B[lj]
;W[lk];B[ll];W[mp];B[mi];W[nj];B[lp];W[lq];B[mq];W[mr];B[nq];W[gl];B[ep];W[eo]LB[do:a]C[W86, White should simply extend at 'a', this way Black couldn't make life easily as in the real game.]
;B[dq];W[cq];B[eq];W[do];B[er];W[cr];B[fo];W[rf]C[The attachment of W94 is a very big move, White not only makes a base for himself and also leaves some aji in Black's corner.];B[re];W[rg];B[ld];W[kc];B[kj]C[After Black reinforces the center with B99, it is already a close game. Afterwards, both sides get into the endgame fight. In the final phase, the outcome of the game will be decided by half point, Kobayashi is luckier and won the game by half point.]
