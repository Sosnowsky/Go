(;B[ho]LB[cq:a][cr:b][cp:c][br:d][ck:e]C[The play of B9 is simple and clear, Black can also directly attach at 'a', then W 'b', B 'c', W 'd' and B 'd' (see var a).];W[hq]LB[dj:a][iq:b]C[W10: If White makes the two-space extension at 'a', then Black will play at 'b'.];B[cq];W[cr];B[dj]TR[ho]C[B13: Due to the existence of the marked black stone, the wide pincer of B13 is inevitable.]
;W[ch]LB[fl:a]C[W14 is the vital point, and it is better than escaping at 'a'.];B[cp];W[gn];B[go];W[br];B[el];W[eh]C[W20 is a mutual good point, indirectly preventing Black from invading.];B[ci];W[bh];B[fc]LB[jd:a]C[B23: Black prevents White from making the extension at 'a' on the top.]
;W[de]LB[ic:a][dd:b][cd:c][cc:d]C[If W24 at 'a', then B 'b', if W 'c', then Black will twist-cut at 'd', White is no good.];B[ic];W[nc];B[lc];W[qc];B[pc];W[qd];B[pe];W[pb]
;B[ob];W[qb];B[oc];W[qf]C[Through W36, White clearly adopts a territory-oriented strategy.];B[gq]LB[iq:a][ir:b][hp:c][jq:d]C[B37 is a good sequence play, if Black directly plays at 'a', then W 'b', when B 'c', White will atari at 'd', Black is no good.];W[gr];B[iq];W[ir];B[hp]
;W[gp];B[jq];W[pn]C[W44 is an unusual tactic, but is very proper at this situation, because Black is open at the bottom, Black can't enclose the lower right territory with just a single move.];B[qn]C[B45 is very nimble, not following White's plan.];W[po]LB[qm:a][pm:b]C[If W46 at 'a', then Black will cut at 'b', because Black has more stones in this area, White has no certainty of success in the fighting.];B[qo];W[pp];B[pq];W[oq];B[pm]C[Through B51, it unexpected leads to the shape of the"large avalanche" joseki.]
;W[om]LB[qq:a]C[W52 is a variation from the joseki, if White cuts at 'a' as joseki, because on the left Black has stones to support, White is no good.];B[pr];W[no]LB[em:a]C[W54 is the vital point for the shape, White also aims to pull out his stones at around 'a'.];B[pl]C[Through B55, Black has gained a considerable territory.];W[ck]C[W56: White pounds at Black's thinness.];B[em]LB[bi:a]C[B57 is a thick play, separating at 'a' seems a little unreasonable.];W[bi]C[After White crosses over with W58, White is leading in territory, but Black obtains sente, so the outcome of the game is still not clear.]
;B[qh]C[B59 is a waiting-for-so-long good point.];W[ol];B[ok];W[nk];B[nj];W[mk];B[mj];W[lk]C[Although the sequence from W62 to W66 has abated the power of Black's thickness in the lower right, but Black at the top forms another thickness.];B[lj]
(;W[qg]LB[kk:a][re:b][qe:c][rf:d][rd:e]C[W68: White is alert, if White retreats at 'a', then B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e' and B68, White's corner is very small, however Black's territory becomes bigger (see var a).];B[kk];W[mm]LB[kl:a]C[W70 is the vital point, if playing the hane at 'a', then later on Black can strike at 70.];B[ph]C[After B71, Black's moyo at the top is very impressive, White must take some action.];W[rh];B[ri]
;W[of];B[pf];W[pg]C[With the sequence from W72 to W76, White leaves Black so many cutting points.];B[og];W[ld]C[W78: White starts to manage and dodge his stones at the top.];B[kd];W[ke];B[jd];W[nf]C[W82 is relentless, Black already can't take care of two sides.];B[rg];W[rf];B[nd]

;W[hf]C[The reduction of W98 is inevitable.];B[ed];W[dd];B[hg]C[B101 is strong and unyielding, both sides has no way to back down.];W[lg]C[W102 demonstrates that White wants to destroy Black's territory completely, but White also takes a big risk.];B[mh];W[if];B[gf];W[ge];B[fe];W[je];B[he]
