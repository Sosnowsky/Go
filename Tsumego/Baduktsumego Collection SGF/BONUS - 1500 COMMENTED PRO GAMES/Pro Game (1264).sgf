This time I got into final four, and it's a very good opportunity for me.];B[dq];W[qq]
;B[ce];W[di];B[cg];W[cd];B[ed];W[ec];B[fd];W[be]C[Hane at W12 was a very popular joseki, it's rare to see recently.];B[dd];W[cf];B[de];W[bd]LB[bf:a][df:b][bc:c]C[W16 is a new move, in old joseki this move is at 'c', Black then atari at 'a', and White 'b', it's leading to a very complicated variation, there is no final conclusion yet.];B[df];W[bf];B[eh];W[gb]C[Through W20, it's a very new situation and hard to judge who is better.];B[dn];W[jq];B[hq];W[np];B[qk];W[qm];B[io]LB[nd:a]C[B27 is the pivotal point, however, it's easier to control if protecting the corner with 'a'.]
;W[oc];B[pe];W[md];B[pc];W[ob];B[ok];W[mf]C[Through W34's jumping to the center, it seems White's opening is more smooth and successful.];B[bg];W[fj];B[gi];W[cl];B[cm];W[dl]
;B[hk];W[gl];B[mp];W[mq];B[lq];W[mr];B[ei]C[B47 turns out to be a gote move, it needs more study, but how to attack is a difficult problem.];W[en]C[W48 tenuki is a good move !];B[eo];W[fn];B[gk];W[fk]
;B[hl];W[gm]C[Through W54, White has a living shape, Black's attack fails.];B[qp]C[B55 is a good tesuji to settle his stones.];W[pp];B[po];W[qo];B[op];W[rp];B[no];W[nq];B[id]LB[lo:a][lr:b]C[B63 tenuki is questionable. B63 should play at 'a', White has to cross under at 'b', then Black play 63, if so, the game is still very close.];W[mo]LB[ph:a]C[W64 atari is very big ! also invasion at 'a' is now possible, White starts to lead in the game.];B[fo];W[bi]C[W66 exchange with B67,69 is not necessary, it should be reserved.];B[dm];W[em];B[bm];W[fi];B[fh];W[in];B[ej];W[ek]
;B[kp];W[lp];B[lo];W[mn];B[mp];W[ln];B[kn];W[ho];B[ip];W[km];B[hi];W[ph]C[W86 is the last big point on the board, White is clearly leading in territory.];B[jm]
;W[kl]LB[bl:a][hm:b][hn:c][dj:d][bk:e]C[The extension at W88 is an overplay, it should be played at 'a' to live. After B89, Black can push through at 'b' at any time, White can not connect at 'c', if White connect, the following moves are B 'd', W 'a' and B 'e', White is dead unconditionally. This is a very good opportunity for Black.];B[ml];W[nm];B[nh];W[of];B[qg];W[oh];B[ri]
