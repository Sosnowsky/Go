];W[dp]
;B[fq];W[cn];B[kq]C[Black starts with the "mini-Chinese" fuseki, Chang Hao lost several times in this opening while taking White, not sure whether today he has well prepared on how to deal with this fuseki.];W[qj];B[pk]LB[qf:a][qg:b][qk:c]C[B9 is the play invented by Chinese players, but now more Korean players like to play this way, this move can also be played to protect the corner at 'a' or 'b'  or attach at 'c'.];W[qk];B[ql];W[rl];B[pj]
;W[qm];B[pl];W[qi];B[pm];W[qn];B[pn]LB[rp:a][rq:b][ro:c][pq:d]C[B19 is a thick and good move, next if it leads to the variation of W 'a', B 'b', W 'c' and B 'd', because White obtains sente, the result would be to White's advantage.];W[hp]LB[ip:a]C[W20 is seldom seen, the usual move is at 'a'.]
;B[fo];W[hn]C[W22 is inevitable, otherwise Black will start to attack White fiercely while backing by Black's thickness on the right side.];B[dr];W[cq];B[hr];W[ko]C[W26 is an excellent point.];B[iq]C[B27 is a calm and patient move, Black has completely strengthened his connection problem at the bottom.];W[fm]C[W28: White aims to reinforce the center and also prevent Black from sticking his head out in this area.];B[km]LB[qo:a][lp:b]C[B29: For Black to bump at 'a' is not big any more, White may tenuki and make the diagonal's extension at 'b'.]
;W[jn]C[W30 is necessary.];B[qg]C[B31 is a big point.];W[rp];B[po];W[ro];B[rm]C[B35 is an asking move.];W[rn]LB[pi:a]C[After White answers with W36, later on the press of B 'a' will be a good point.];B[cf];W[ch];B[cc]
;W[cd];B[dc];W[ed];B[bd];W[be];B[bc];W[ce];B[fc];W[ge]LB[ik:a]C[Gu Li 7p: W48 is not good, White should make the large knight's move at 'a', which is the vital point for both sides' moyo expansion.];B[il];W[fn];B[gk]
;W[gi];B[ij];W[fk]C[White has formed a territory of nearly 50 points on the left side, this is probably too big as to Black, White's opening is successful.];B[nc]C[Gu Li 7p: After B49 and B51, Black grabs the big point of B55, Black is favorable for the game.];W[ih];B[fl]LB[el:a][fj:b][gl:c][gj:d][ek:e][dl:f][em:g][en:h][gm:i][gn:j][dm:k][cm:l][dk:m][cl:n][hi:o]C[B57 is a strong play, White has some defects over here. After B57, if White simply plays at 'a', then B 'b', W 'c' and B 'd', Black would be certainly satisfied; If White retreats at 'e', then B 'a', W 'f', B 'g', W 'h', B 'i', W 'j', B 'k', W 'l', B 'm', W 'n' and B 'o', White in the center becomes weak and thin, White must come up with a better play.

After this move, it is time for noon break.]
;W[gl];B[fj];W[gj];B[ek];W[hk]C[Here it leads to a very important ko fight, which will impact the whole game.];B[hl];W[fk];B[rk];W[sm];B[gk];W[gm];B[ci]LB[hj:a][fk:b][sl:c][rm:d][qq:e]C[B69: Black aims to make the ko bigger. If Black initiates the ko at 'a', then W 'b', B 'c', White connects, B 'd' and W 'e', Black is no good.]
;W[dh]LB[cm:a][dn:b][ck:c]C[Gu Li 7p: Black should directly attach at 'a', White can only answer at 'b', then Black can easily make life by jumping to 'c'.];B[di];W[fk];B[cm]LB[el:a][bn:b]C[If White eliminates the ko at 'a', for Black to hane at 'b' and make life should not be a big problem, White is difficult to answer.];W[cl];B[bh];W[bg]
;B[bm];W[el]LB[dl:a][bl:b][dm:c][ck:d][bk:e][bi:f][bj:g][ah:h][co:i][do:j][bn:k][bp:l]C[W78: If White retreats at 'a', then Black will turn at 'b', Black can easily make life. After W78, B 'a' is still a simple tactic. Although White's territory has been destroyed, but White has taken two black stones in the center and becomes very thick, Black's several stones are very weak, so White also has gained some profit.

Gu Li 7p: W78 is a mistake, White should play at 'c', then B 'b', W 'd', B 'e', W 'f', B 'g', W 'h', B 'i', W 'j', B 'k' and W 'l', this way Black's dragon is dangerous.]
;B[dn]LB[bl:a][bk:b][eo:c][cr:d][dl:e]C[The hane of B79 seems no better than the turn at 'a', now White has the strong diagonal at 'b', then B 'c' and W 'd', White in the lower left will live.

Gu Li 7p: However, next Black also makes a big mistake! Black should wedge at 'e', no matter what White will do, you can say that the game is already over!];W[dm]C[Gu Li 7p: After White cuts with W80, Black is already in a collapsing state.];B[bl];W[ck];B[co];W[do];B[bn];W[bk]LB[bp:a]C[Gu Li: White is too soft-hearted, White can play the diagonal's move at 'a' to kill all Black!]
;B[bq];W[en]LB[br:a][bp:b][cr:c][dq:d][cp:e]C[W88: White has no other choice, if White plays the hane at 'a', then B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e' and B88, White is no good.];B[cr];W[qc]C[White gets to obtain sente and enter the corner, it seems White is not bad.

Gu Li 7p: W90 is no good, White should directly attach at 'a', this way White is a little favorable for the game.]LB[gc:a];B[qd]C[Here White has the maneuver of ko-living, White can immediately initiate the ko and White can also play other big points.];W[rd]
;B[re];W[pb];B[rc];W[rb];B[sd];W[nb];B[mb];W[oc];B[na];W[oa]C[Gu Li 7p: W102 again is not good, White certainly should connect at 'a', Black couldn't kill White.];B[ob];W[bp];B[cp]
;W[nb];B[bj];W[dq];B[bo];W[ma];B[cg];W[ah];B[bi];W[bf];B[eh]C[With B111 and B115, Black strikes back bravely.

Gu Li 7p: Black should directly cross over at 'a', this way Black is not bad.]LB[ak:a];W[ak]C[Through 116, it seems White's choice of fighting a ko in the upper right is not good, Black has caught up a lot.]
;B[fg];W[ef];B[dk];W[fi];B[hg]C[B121: Black runs toward the center, White must kill Black or gain sufficient profit in order to win this game, Black also takes some risk, so the situation is still not clear.];W[dg];B[ei];W[ej];B[eg]C[Chang Hao is pondering ...];W[df];B[hh];W[hi]
;B[ig];W[ii];B[ie];W[od];B[lb]C[Gu Li 7p: B133 is an overplay, Black can only connect back at 'a'.]LB[hc:a];W[kc];B[md];W[ke];B[kg];W[me];B[ld];W[le]
;B[kd];W[jd];B[jc];W[je];B[jb];W[id];B[lh];W[li];B[mi];W[lj];B[mh];W[mj];B[eo]C[B153 is an overplay, Black should strengthen the upper left.

Gu Li 7p: Black can only reinforce by playing at 'a'.]LB[pi:a]
;W[pg]C[W154 is a good move.];B[pf];W[of]C[The hane of W156 makes Black painful, Black in the center is still not completely stable.];B[og];W[ph];B[oe];W[nf];B[oi]C[B161: Black must reinforce.];W[qf];B[pe];W[nd]LB[rg:a][hb:b][ne:c]C[After W164, 'a' and 'b' becomes miai, Black can't take both points.

Gu Li 7p: W164 is a miscalculation, White should play at 'c'.]
;B[hc];W[ic];B[ib];W[gf]LB[rg:a][if:b][jh:c][ne:d][jg:e]C[W168: How about capturing Black at 'a'? this way White should still have chances. (W168 was regarded  by pros as a big mistake!)

Gu Li 7p: W168 is again a big mistake! White should atari at 'b', if Black answers at 'c', then White will prevent the cut in sente; If Black answers at 'd', then White can kill Black's big dragon by playing at 'e'!];B[ne];W[mc];B[lc];W[la]

How could White play a 10-point endgame in this crucial moment?! Now White should play the hane at 'a', by using the ko threats in the lower left to kill Black at the top, this way White can win the game with one stroke!]
