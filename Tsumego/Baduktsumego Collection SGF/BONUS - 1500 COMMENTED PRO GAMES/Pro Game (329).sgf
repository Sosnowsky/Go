(;SZ[19]KM[5.5]EV[1st China-Japan SuperGo final game]DT[1985-11-20]PC[Beijing, China]PB[Nie Weiping]BR[9p]PW[Fujisawa Hideyuki]WR[9p]RE[B+7.5]C[The most exciting game,
1985 is a very important year in Chinese Go history, in this year, China-Japan SuperGo was born. In the public opinion of "Chinese must lose", Jiang Zhujiu first won five consecutive games which made this event suddenly suspenseful, next "SuperGo hero" Nie Weiping defeated Kobayashi Koichi, Kato Masao and Fujisawa Hideyuki successively and shocked the world. Although it was unexpected that the insufferably arrogant top-flight Japanese Go players lost the match, but due to this surprising victory, it very luckily brought up one or even two new generations of Chinese Go fans. Not only Nie Weiping achieved an amazing victory for Chinese team, he also completely surpassed himself and put himself into the ranks of world-class top-notch players.];B[qd]C[Fujisawa normally will play at star points, today he elected to play at 3-3, this was perhaps the strategy he prepared before the game.];W[cc];B[pq];W[dq];B[oc]
;W[po];B[qo];W[qn];B[qp];W[pm];B[nq];W[qi];B[co];W[rd]LB[qg:a]C[The attachment of W14 is new, White obviously tries to prevent Black from making a two-space extension at 'a'.];B[re];W[qe];B[qf]C[The hane of B15 and the atari of B17 are the most positive attitude.]
;W[pe];B[rc];W[pd];B[qc];W[rf];B[sd];W[rg]C[Through W24, the local variation comes to an end, the situation is about equal.];B[cf];W[dj]C[B25 takes Black 7 minutes and W26 takes White 13 minutes.];B[dd];W[dc];B[fd]
;W[ec];B[ff];W[gc];B[cl];W[fj];B[oj]LB[pk:a]C[Black plays lightly with B35, thinking White will answer one more at 'a'.];W[pj]C[White hits with W36 surprisingly, not giving way one inch at all.];B[oi];W[pg]C[Black has no choice but to extend with B37, White takes the chance to reinforce completely with W38. Later B35 and B37 may become under White's attack.];B[bq]C[Black calmly makes the knight's move of B39, this is related to the base for both sides and it is a big move.]
;W[do];B[dn];W[eo];B[en];W[fn];B[el];W[go]LB[gp:a]C[The tiger's move of W46 is regarded as an inevitable move by Fujisawa, but I think with W46 White can strengthen with the knight's move at 'a'. Top-rated players even have different opinions, we can see how subtle and profound Go game is.];B[fp];W[fo];B[gl];W[jp]LB[hj:a]C[W50: Almost all pros think White certainly should jump to 'a', but Fujisawa ignores two stones on the left and grabs the large knight's move at the bottom. After the game, Fujisawa thinks White has to play this way, but this may causes White become passive for the whole game.]
;B[hj]C[The cap of B51 is inevitable.];W[fg]C[The attachment of W52 is a surprising move.];B[eg];W[fh];B[eh];W[ei];B[gf];W[hh];B[gi];W[fi];B[hg];W[ek]
;B[ih]C[The hane of B63 prevents White from charging to the center, finally Black takes control of the situation.];W[dl];B[dm]LB[fm:a]C[B65: Black should hang at 'a', although White can make life on the left side, but Black can connect with the center, for the whole game Black is leading. In the game, White escapes successfully, Black's attack comes to nothing.];W[fl];B[dk];W[gk];B[fm];W[hk];B[ij];W[hl];B[fk]
;W[gj];B[kq]C[The sequence from B75 to B79 is huge. Black is slightly leading in territory.];W[jq];B[jr];W[ir];B[kr];W[cd];B[kj];W[hq];B[dr]C[After White strengthens with the tiger's move of W82, Black attaches with B83, which seems to be a very alert move.];W[cq]C[Unexpectedly White counterattacks strongly with the hit of W84.];B[cp]C[After calm and careful analysis, I have safely settled the situation with B85, as for the result, I didn't incur any loss, it is very dangerous!]
