Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[pd]C[In the round 2 of the 10th Samsung, Gu Li takes White against Lee Changho, this is a game that go fans are waiting for.];W[dd];B[qp];W[dp];B[nq]
;W[qf]LB[qk:a]C[W6: For White to split at 'a' is common. In the real game, White directly approaches the corner to avoid common variations.];B[qh];W[qc];B[qd];W[pc];B[od];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[qe];W[nc];B[fq]
;W[hq];B[cf];W[cn]LB[fc:a][fp:b][cq:c]C[W20: If White answers at 'a', then B20, W 'b' and B 'c', this is the most popular joseki in Korea. In the game, the knight's move of W20 is to mess up Black's tempo.
];B[dr]C[B21 is a surprising move.];W[fp]LB[cq:a]C[W22: White can consider to make the diagonal move at 'a'.];B[eq];W[gp];B[cq]
;W[ch];B[cc];W[cd];B[dc];W[ed];B[bd];W[be];B[bc];W[ce];B[fc]C[Through B36, on the board two josekis are same, it is relatively easy to judge the situation, Black can be satisfied in the opening.];W[bp]LB[gi:a][do:b]C[W36: White also can consider to expand his situation at 'a', however Black's attachment at 'b' will be a good move.]

;W[gc];B[fd];W[fe];B[gd];W[ee]C[White's sequence from W46 to W54 is damaging, only Gu Li has such courage to play like this.];B[gi]C[The attachment of B55 is a good move to dodge, White has no good attacking tactic.];W[gh];B[gj];W[hj];B[gk];W[hk];B[gl]
;W[im];B[dl];W[bq];B[br];W[ar];B[ep];W[eo];B[bs];W[ck];B[dk];W[cl];B[cj]C[Through B73, Black makes life easily, White's attack following W46 comes to nothing, White's situation is not optimistic.];W[qj]
;B[qm];W[rf];B[sf]C[The exchange of W76 and B77 should be reserved.];W[pq]LB[sg:a][se:b][pf:c][rg:d][ph:e][qi:f][pi:g][pj:h]C[W78: White wants to atari at 'a', next B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f', W 'g' and B 'h', but it is not working for now. ];B[pp]C[The block of B79 is thick.]
;W[qq]LB[pn:a]C[B80: If Black blocks then W 'a', during the fight, the above variation can start at any time.];B[oq];W[rp];B[ro];W[rr];B[pf];W[pn];B[oo];W[ok];B[on]C[Through B89, Black handles properly, Black is one more step closer to victory.
];W[eg]C[It seems the wedge of W90 is not the vital point to attack, but how White should attack is also really difficult to say.]
;B[bj]LB[ci:a]C[B91: Black can consider to wrap at 'a', living completely with one move. In the real game, B91 is more positive, but it is not the vital point for eye shape.
];W[dm];B[gn];W[fm];B[bm]C[After this move, it is time for lunch break.];W[cm];B[hl];W[il];B[hn];W[jo];B[fn]LB[fo:a]C[B101: Black should cut at 'a', White is more difficult to handle.]
;W[hr];B[gr];W[em];B[fg];W[ff];B[gg];W[hh];B[fh];W[fo];B[oi]C[Through B111, Black still keeps the advantage.];W[pm];B[qn];W[pi]

;W[sq];B[rq];W[gq];B[fr];W[rp];B[ml];W[nn]C[The cut of W134 is a game-deciding move, the situation becomes chaotic.];B[rq];W[hd];B[hc];W[rp];B[lm];W[no]
;B[rq];W[ge];B[fa];W[rp];B[mn]LB[lk:a][ek:b]C[B145: Black also can consider to hang at 'a', if White directly initiates the ko, Black can sacrifice the big dragon, Black will win the game. However, before initiating the ko, White can destroy eye at 'b' first, making Black's dragon heavier, White can fight.];W[po];B[op];W[ek];B[hf];W[jf];B[he]

;W[kc];B[ld];W[lc];B[ic];W[le];B[lk]LB[bn:a][ip:b]C[B183: Black should crawl at 'a', White connects and B 'b'. It is better for Black to strike here first, it makes even bigger difference.];W[md];B[ie];W[ph];B[pg];W[ri]
