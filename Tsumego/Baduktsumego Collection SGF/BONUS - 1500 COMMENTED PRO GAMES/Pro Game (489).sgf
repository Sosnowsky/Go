Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[pd]C[In the final round of 12th LG Cup preliminary, I defeated Yun Hyeok 5p and advanced to the main event.];W[dd]C[Yun Hyeok seeks beauty of every move and likes to think for a long time, but his time allotment is not ideal and he always enters into over time very early on.];B[pq]C[In this game, since his time is inadequate, he miscalculated in the end and I won the game luckily.];W[cp];B[ep]
;W[eq];B[fq];W[dq];B[fp];W[cn];B[qk]LB[jp:a]C[B11: Yun takes 15 minutes to play this move, in fact for Black to play at 'a' is already very good.];W[kq]C[W12: White can make two-space extension on both sides and is easier to play.];B[iq]C[B13: Yun takes another 15 minutes for this move, precious time was just used this way.];W[nq];B[po];W[ko]C[W16: White breaks up the situation and can fight.]
;B[fc];W[hc]C[W18 is common move when the value on left side is not big.];B[cc];W[dc];B[cd];W[de];B[db];W[eb];B[cb];W[ec];B[cf];W[kc];B[qf]
;W[io]C[W30 is the vital point.];B[jq]C[Black's shape is restricted and Black is not comfortable.];W[kr];B[fm]LB[en:a][go:b][em:c]C[B33 leaves White two peeks at 'a' and 'b', for Black to jump to 'c' is better.];W[qm];B[ro]LB[pm:a]C[B35 is steady, but it seems Black wants to press at 'a'.];W[om]
;B[ok];W[nn]C[W36 and W38: White easily destroys Black's territory and can be satisfied.];B[oc];W[en];B[fn];W[go];B[fo];W[pg]C[W44 is one of my proud moves.];B[qg]LB[ng:a]C[B45: Black is being pressed to low position and painful. If Black counterattacks at 'a', White can block at 45 and is not difficult to handle.];W[pi];B[ni]
;W[ng];B[qh];W[oi]C[Yun Hyeok enters into overtime.];B[nj];W[qi]LB[lg:a]C[W52 is one regrettable move. Here White has no possibility to attack Black, its value is very small. For White to jump at 'a' is simple and clear.];B[lg]C[B53 is good move.];W[pf];B[pe];W[mh];B[ki];W[nd]C[W58: White is forced to play in small places and painful.]
;B[no]LB[lj:a]C[B59 is unnecessary. Black should directly play at 'a'.];W[mo];B[np];W[mp]LB[lj:a]C[W62: White is not alert enough, now to play at 'a' is excellent timing to fight.];B[lj];W[lh]LB[nc:a]C[W64 is again careless move, for White to play at 'a' is much better.];B[kh];W[kg]
;B[lf];W[nf];B[nc];W[mk];B[li];W[md];B[jg];W[kf];B[ld]LB[mc:a][je:b]C[B75 is a good move, which I overlooked. If W 'a', then B 'b', White is not good.];W[ke]LB[lc:a]C[But W76 is not good, to play at 'a' is better.]
;B[le]C[After Black connects with B77, White is difficult to handle.];W[mc];B[kd];W[je];B[lc];W[lb];B[id];W[nb];B[ic];W[qc];B[pc];W[qb];B[rd]
;W[qd];B[qe];W[rc];B[se];W[ob];B[pb];W[pa];B[ri];W[rj];B[si]C[In the exchange up to B99, Black is thick on the outside and takes advantage, White sinks into bitter battle.];W[kb]LB[jb:a]C[W100 at 'a' is better.]
;B[ie];W[ib];B[oa];W[na];B[fb];W[fd];B[gd];W[fe];B[gc];W[hb]LB[eg:a]C[W110 should be at 'a'.];B[ge];W[fa]
;B[ga];W[ea];B[gb];W[eg];B[df]C[B117 is good move!];W[ef];B[dh];W[gg]C[W120: White has to play near Black's iron wall, painful.];B[gf]LB[ck:a]C[B121 at 'a' is relatively steady.];W[ej]C[W122 is game-deciding move, ignoring his own safety and turning to attack Black's big group at bottom. White's situation takes a better turn.]
;B[dj];W[ig];B[jh];W[dk];B[di];W[ek];B[ck];W[cl];B[bl];W[hk];B[hn];W[ip];B[hl]
;W[il]LB[dl:a][fk:b][ik:c]C[W136 is impulsive move, White overlooked Black's good moves at 'a' and 'b', White should answer at 'c'.];B[gk];W[gj];B[dl];W[cm];B[hj];W[ik];B[fk];W[ei]LB[bh:a][ch:b]C[W144: Both sides have miscalculated. We all thought, White has the tactic at 'a', Black needs to reinforce. In fact, Black can answer at 'b', there is no loophole inside territory.]
;B[el];W[gi];B[bj]LB[ii:a]C[If B147 at 'a', White is not good.];W[ii];B[fr];W[hm];B[do];W[bm];B[cr]C[B153 is severe, classic tesuji!];W[cq]C[The situation is again not clear.];B[ds]
;W[br];B[bs];W[ar];B[am];W[an];B[co];W[bo];B[al];W[dn];B[ap];W[bp];B[ho];W[hp]
;B[gp];W[in];B[gn];W[rk]LB[oq:a]C[W172 is small, White should play at 'a'.];B[oq]C[The value of B173 is huge.];W[nr];B[or]C[Now Black is favorable.];W[ce];B[be];W[bd];B[bf]
;W[lk];B[rm]LB[fg:a]C[B181 again is miscalculation. If Black reinforces the big dragon at 'a', Black will win the game.];W[rl];B[qn];W[jf]LB[ql:a]C[W184: White used all his 10-minute remaining time, and at the same time Black also saw clearly his big dragon already can't make life and simply conceded defeat.

Wang Lei advanced to the main event.])
