Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[In round 1, Chang Hao luckily defeated Jo HanSeung by 2.5 points, it was a pretty dramatic game.];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[fc]
;W[df];B[db];W[od]C[We have studied a lot regarding the avalanche variation following W8, it is just right time to use it.];B[oc];W[pd];B[pc];W[qe];B[nc];W[nd];B[md];W[qc];B[rd];W[qb]
;B[rc];W[mc];B[lc];W[rb];B[re];W[mb];B[nb];W[lb];B[pb];W[qf];B[rf]LB[ld:a][pa:b][oa:c]C[B29 is correct move, in the past, the variation is B 'a', W 'b', B 'c', and W29, Black is not good.]
;W[kc];B[ld];W[of];B[qg]LB[kd:a]C[B33 is not seen before, the common move is to press at 'a'.];W[pg];B[qh];W[kd]C[After White presses with W36, Black's liberty is tight and Black is not happy.];B[lf];W[mf];B[ke];W[id]
;B[lh];W[lg]C[W38 and W42 are all vital points.];B[kg];W[mg];B[je]C[Black is forced to make damaging exchanges with B39 and B45, White gains advantage.];W[oa];B[pa];W[na];B[ra];W[kh]C[White first cuts with W50, it is important.];B[jg];W[hc]
;B[li]C[Since Black is not favorable in ladder, Black can only extend with B53, painful.];W[oi];B[cc];W[ki]C[White presses out with W56, Black is being separated and very passive.];B[gd]C[So far, White is successful in the opening.];W[he];B[gf]C[B57 and B59 are strong moves. If Black can seal off White, Black will turn the situation around.];W[eb]C[As to this, W60 is tesuji.];B[ec];W[dc];B[cb]
;W[hf];B[hg];W[fb];B[ee];W[ge];B[de]C[Through B69, White has paid a little price but destroyed Black's enclosure. Overall, White is still favorable.];W[gg];B[ff];W[hh]LB[ig:a]C[If W72 at 'a', after Black extends and White pushes, White still can't capture Black.];B[ig];W[gh]
;B[ii]C[As to professional players, it is very painful to stick head out like B75, too crude!];W[kj];B[ji];W[gj];B[ik];W[dh];B[cn]C[B81: Black grabs territory desperately.];W[im]LB[cl:a]C[W82: Of course, White wants to attack Black's big dragon. Moreover, for White to force at 'a' is also not bad.];B[gk]LB[hl:a][fk:b]C[Now if Black plays loosely, like B83 at 'a', White will take chance to attack at 'b', Black will fight painfully to the end and has no chance to win the game.]
;W[fk];B[gl];W[fl];B[fm];W[gm];B[fj]C[B83, B87 and B89 are all relentless and fierce moves. Jo HanSeung's sharp game consciousness is vivid on the board.];W[hk]LB[ej:a]C[W90: White perhaps judges, to capture Black's big dragon is already good enough, otherwise to play atari at 'a' is more relentless.];B[hl];W[hj];B[il];W[ij]
;B[jj];W[jk];B[jl];W[kk];B[el];W[ek];B[kl];W[mk];B[fi];W[eg];B[dk];W[ce];B[cd]
;W[fe];B[ef];W[fg];B[ed];W[gq]LB[ej:a]C[W112: If White escapes three stones at 'a', Black will push down, White's liberty will be inadequate in the capturing race at top.];B[iq];W[ll];B[di];W[dq];B[ch];W[cg];B[bh]
;W[bg];B[be];W[ci];B[bi];W[cj];B[bj];W[ck];B[cl];W[jf]C[As a result, White has to capture by reducing liberties, not that big as imagined.];B[po]C[Black's situation takes a better turn.];W[ln]LB[lp:a]C[W130 is slow, to play at 'a' is more active.]
;B[lp];W[ro];B[rq];W[ql];B[bp];W[bq];B[cp];W[cq];B[hq];W[gr];B[ib]C[B141 is tesuji.];W[jd]LB[ic:a]C[W142 should be at 'a'.]
;B[jb];W[kb];B[hd]C[After B145, White incurs loss.];W[ie]C[So far, Black already catches up in territory, White has to destroy Black's territory at bottom in order to keep situational balance.];B[ic];W[nq];B[np]LB[mp:a]C[B149 is too slow! Black should play at 'a', much better than the real game.];W[mq];B[mp];W[kr]C[W152: White flies out comfortably and also obtains sente, can't believe it!]
;B[or];W[jq];B[io];W[jp];B[go];W[jo];B[lq];W[in];B[ej];W[mr];B[kn];W[qj]C[W164 is the last big point on the board. After this, White is a little favorable.];B[ho]
;W[jn];B[lr];W[ls]LB[jr:a]C[Next for Black to play at 'a' is much better than the real game (please see variation a).]

;B[sr];W[ah];B[ak];W[so];B[ap];W[cr];B[bf];W[ka]C[W224 is also clever endgame. After making one eye, White can fill one point less inside territory.];B[hb];W[ma];B[sb];W[rr];B[rs]C[In the end, with B229 Black holds the ko tenaciously, but gains very little.]
