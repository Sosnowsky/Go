;W[ce];B[dd];W[cd];B[ec];W[cf];B[db];W[cc];B[jc]LB[kc:a]C[B13: For Black to make an extension at 'a' is also very common, but recently to play at 13 is relatively more often.];W[oc];B[pc]LB[mc:a]C[When White approaches with W14, the diagonal extension of B15 is inevitable. Black's pincer at 'a' is somewhat weak, this way White seems to have taken advantage.]
;W[od];B[pf]LB[pe:a][lc:b][fd:c]C[B17: For Black to make the diagonal extension at 'a' is also possible, next W 'b' and B 'c', this will be another game, Black is also not bad.];W[lc];B[ke];W[mf];B[me]C[B19 and B21 are plays related to B17, however, in the attack around here, Black also needs to take some risk, if Black ends in gote and White gets to play on the left side first, Black's situation is also not good.];W[ne];B[md];W[mc]
;B[kd];W[pg]C[The play of W26 is too ferocious, if White makes a tiny mistake, White may collapse. W26 is a little exaggerating, in the fight around here I feel White is very dangerous. However, at any rate, Lee Sedol dares play this kind of move in this world big event, his courage is still worth praising.];B[of]LB[og:a][ob:b]C[B27: Black can also hane at 'a', White is difficult to answer too. The original move of W26 is to descend at 'b'.];W[qe]C[The sequence following W28 is one way street, both sides have no way to back down.];B[qf];W[pd];B[qc];W[re];B[pe];W[rf]
;B[qg];W[rg];B[qh];W[rd];B[ob];W[nb];B[qb];W[oa];B[pa];W[pb];B[dq];W[qa];B[ep]LB[nf:a][og:b]C[Through B47, it seems White is successful, after White connects at 'a', Black can't look after both the left and right side. Looking back, B27 appears the right move but actually it is questionable, if Black hanes at 'b', White's play in the real game will not work, if White cuts at 27, then Black will extend at 33, White also has no follow-up.]
;W[cq]LB[nf:a]C[W48 is hasty, White should connect at 'a', this way Black almost is on the verge of collapse and can't take care of both the left and right side, both groups are very heavy, Black's situation would be very bad.];B[do];W[cp];B[eq];W[co];B[dn];W[cn];B[nf]C[B55: Black takes tenuki alertly.];W[dm]C[After White hanes with W56, although the situation is also not to Black's advantage, but relatively the situation already eases up.];B[em];W[eo]LB[el:a]C[The cut of W58 shows Lee Sedol's style, the common feeling is always double-hane at 'a', although the fight after the cut is also to White's favor, however I feel White is unnecessary to play this way.]
;B[en];W[fo];B[hq];W[ho];B[dl];W[cm];B[gl];W[jp];B[io];W[ip];B[hp];W[hn];B[jo]
;W[ko];B[jn];W[hl];B[hk];W[gk]C[Through W76, Black is still difficult to handle.];B[il];W[fl];B[hm];W[gm];B[im];W[hj]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.];B[gj]
;W[fk];B[fj];W[ej];B[ei];W[kn];B[ij];W[hi];B[gh];W[ek];B[kp]C[Through B93, in this fight, Black takes advantage, now the situation becomes close. Looking back, with W76 White still should extend at 77, next Black cuts at 93 and White can cut at 76, this way White can easily take control of the situation.];W[lp];B[kq];W[lq]
;B[kr];W[po];B[di]C[B99 is huge, now the situation becomes unclear.];W[eg];B[fh];W[ff]C[W100 and W102 are inevitable.];B[fd]LB[pm:a]C[B103 is a slow move, Black should take tenuki and attack at 'a'.];W[ge];B[cb];W[if];B[ig]
;W[jf];B[hc];W[jg];B[ih];W[hl];B[ik];W[hg]C[W114 is alert, reinforcing in sente.];B[hh];W[lg]C[Through W116, White successfully destroys Black's moyo in the center, at the same time Black's group on the right side also get affected, I feel White is favorable.];B[ck];W[el];B[pm]
;W[mi]C[W120 is a calm and good move, since White already sticks his head out on this side, so White's several lonely stones at the bottom are already not a big concern any more.];B[pk];W[ji];B[ii];W[qq];B[qr];W[qp];B[or];W[nq]C[W128 is tight, if proceeding this way, Black will not have any chance.];B[ch]C[B129 tests White.];W[cg]LB[df:a]C[W130: If White turns at 'a', then Black will take advantage, in the game, White bumps with W130 strongly, but Black's left with the tactic of squeezing with B131 in the center.]
;B[gf]C[B131 is a game-deciding move.];W[fe];B[he];W[hf];B[gg];W[hd];B[ie];W[gd];B[gc];W[fb]C[W138 and W140 are good moves.];B[fc];W[bb]C[Through W142, White makes life at the top.]
;B[jh]C[After Black pushes with B143, Black also reaches his goal.];W[ml];B[on]C[Black pounds at White with B145, because Black on the left is very thick, this way Black may have a chance. Perhaps with the earlier move of W130, White should be patient.];W[jm];B[in];W[eb]C[W148: White takes advantage as much as possible, but White in the lower right always can't connect together.];B[lf];W[ol];B[pl];W[mn];B[oo];W[pp]C[W154: White can't win the game if the corner doesn't make life.]
;B[op];W[oq];B[pr];W[rr];B[rs];W[sr];B[mr];W[rm]LB[rn:a][qn:b]C[The selection of W162 is questionable, it seems the knight's move at 'a' or the diagonal extension at 'b' is all better.];B[lm]C[B163: Black shows his killing intentions, here the situation is still so unclear, it seems White is more dangerous.];W[oj]
;B[pj];W[pi]C[White takes advantage in sente with W164 and W166.];B[qi];W[kk]C[W168 is a beautiful move, Black has to connect back very painfully as in the game.];B[ll];W[lk];B[jl];W[mg];B[kg];W[kh];B[je];W[mm]LB[nj:a]C[Through W176, it seems Black already can't kill White.

Therefore, it seems with B163, Black should make the knight's move at 'a', this way the situation would be more complicated.]
