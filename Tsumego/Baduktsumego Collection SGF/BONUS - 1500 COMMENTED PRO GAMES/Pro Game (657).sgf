;W[qj];B[dn];W[fp];B[cf]C[The sequence from B1 to B9 is a very familiar opening which Rui Naiwei 9p practiced and learned from Master Go Seigen.]
(;W[dj]LB[fc:a][bd:b][ch:c][cc:d][ce:e][be:f]C[With the double pincer of W10, White is not willing to fall behind. If White makes the small knight's move at 'a' instead, Black will make the knight's move at 'b', if W 'c', B 'd', because B5 is the large corner-enclosure, if W 'e', B 'f' and White hanes and Black also hanes, White is just not favorable for the ladder (see var a).];B[fc];W[ee];B[cc];W[cd];B[dc];W[ge]LB[ed:a][de:b][fe:c]C[W16: White doesn't elect to press one line higher because White is not favorable in the ladder, fearing Black's fight tactic by B 'a', W 'b' and B 'c', but White still has to fight this way. In the game W16 seems slow and loose, Black's profit in the corner is big.]
;B[ed];W[de];B[ql];W[qf];B[nd]C[B19 and B21 are in good tempo.];W[gc];B[bd];W[be];B[bc]C[After White attaches down with W22, Black hanes and connects with B23 and B25, Black takes control of the game.];W[ce];B[qh];W[rh]
;B[rg];W[qg];B[ri];W[rf];B[qi]C[From the invasion of B27 to B33, Black has enlarged her moyo in the lower right corner.];W[qc];B[qd];W[rd];B[pc];W[rb];B[qb];W[rc];B[kc]C[Black takes the chance to extend, B41 is a superb point, settling herself and also slowly moving toward White's moyo, Black's play is brilliant.]
;W[fb];B[eb];W[cp]TR[dn]SQ[cf]C[W44: White starts to attack the triangle marked black stone at a big scale, preventing Black from attaching the corner, this way Black is not easy to pull out the square-marked black stone.];B[dl];W[ck]C[W46 prevents Black from making life locally.];B[gm];W[ip];B[kq];W[cl]TR[cp]LB[fk:a]C[W50 constitutes a doubling of effort with the marked white stone in this early stage of the game, it almost becomes the losing move. White should make the small knight's move at 'a'.]
;B[gj]C[Black easily takes the vital point for reduction and expansion with B51, White's losing trend is already obvious.];W[jo];B[lo];W[jm]C[W54 is loose.];B[ei]C[B55 is alert, strengthening herself and also ruining White's potential of making territory.];W[ej];B[fj];W[em]C[W58 is the follow-up maneuver of W50, but White has spent too many moves here, Black can handle lightly.];B[eg];W[ch];B[hg]C[B59 and B61 are care-free, Black's shape is very good.]
;W[jd];B[jc];W[ic]C[White again ends in gote with W62 and W64.];B[kd];W[je];B[go];W[gp];B[en]C[Black connects back one stone with B67 and B69, White's territory is inadequate.];W[el];B[fm];W[qq];B[pp]
;W[pl]C[White goes all out to destroy territory with W72 and W74, this is the last spot where White can fight for a victory with Black.];B[pm];W[qm];B[qn];W[mq];B[mr];W[rm];B[qk];W[nr];B[or];W[np];B[oq];W[mo]
;B[lp];W[mp];B[lr];W[pn];B[om];W[qo]C[With W86, W88, W90 and W92, White aims to live the corner.];B[on];W[rp];B[po]C[B93 and B95 are calm moves.];W[ro]LB[rr:a]C[W96: If White plays at 'a', Black will take at 'b', White's loss will outweigh her gain.];B[qr]
;W[rk];B[rj];W[rl];B[pj];W[rr];B[pq];W[rq]LB[sn:a]C[W104 is a suicidal move. White can live locally by hanging at 'a'. Perhaps White decided to play this way after seeing even White lives and White would be still behind in the game.];B[rn]C[Black pushes with B105, White's big group is not alive yet.];W[sn];B[pn];W[qs]
;B[pr];W[hl]C[The sequence following W110 is useless, White incurs a big defeat.];B[fk];W[fo];B[ek];W[dm];B[cm];W[dk];B[fl];W[dl];B[fn];W[fd];B[ec]
