;B[cn];W[cp];B[ce];W[ed];B[dm];W[fq];B[ci];W[oc]C[The opening from B1 to W14 is very steady.];B[kc]C[The three-space low pincer of B15 was used recently by Zhou Heyang against Park YuongHoon in Samsung Cup.];W[pe]LB[of:a]C[W16: White doesn't make the two-space jump at 'a' as Park YuongHoon did, in the game the knight's press of W16 is also one variation.];B[qe]
;W[pf];B[qg];W[ic];B[ke];W[qc]LB[qf:a]C[White attaches the corner with W22, initiating the first fight in the opening, at any rate Black is reluctant to steadily connect at 'a'.];B[pd];W[od];B[pc];W[qf];B[rf];W[rg];B[re]
;W[qh];B[oe]C[Through the cut of B31, because Black relatively has more stones in this area, it seems the fight will be slightly to Black's favor.];W[ne]C[The atari of W32 seeks the tempo of playing.];B[of];W[pg];B[nf];W[mf]C[The double-hane of W36 is inevitable.];B[oh]LB[me:a][ng:b]C[B37: If Black cuts and ataris at 'a', W 'b' wrapping up worries Black, Black's profit would be not big and some aji will be left also, White's outside is thick, Black is reluctant to play this way.];W[md]
;B[mh];W[qk]C[W40: If White sticks the head in the center, White is worried that Black will force at around 40, this way White also will sink into a bitter battle.];B[kg]C[In the game, although White strengthens the right side, but Black gets to seal off the center with B41, White's situation is still no good.];W[lc];B[kb];W[mg];B[nh];W[pb];B[qb];W[qa];B[rc];W[nb]
;B[ra];W[lb]C[Through W52, White lives painfully in gote, I think so far Black is favorable in the game.];B[hd]C[B53: Black wants to press White over here and also makes himself thicker.];W[df];B[cf];W[id];B[he];W[ie];B[hc];W[hb];B[hf]LB[gb:a]C[B61 seems a little "entering into state", this move is too heavy, it seems not bad at all for Black to hane at 'a' and then retreat.]
;W[gb]C[White crosses over with one move of W62, White gets to take a breather.];B[if];W[dg];B[ch];W[ff];B[qm];W[ok];B[pj];W[qj];B[pk];W[pl];B[ql];W[oi]C[When Black pushes and cuts with B71 and B73, W74 is a good move for fixing the shape.]
;B[pi];W[ph];B[oj];W[nj];B[ni];W[qi];B[oi]C[Through B81, Black's profit is not as big as expected.];W[pp]C[The attachment of W82 is also a tight good move.];B[op];W[po];B[qq];W[pm]
;B[qn];W[pn];B[ro];W[nk]C[Through W90, White successfully destroys Black's moyo at the bottom, now the situation is not clear, the reason of causing the current situation is Black's slow move of B61, no matter what Black should play the hane at 62.];B[li]C[B91 is a good move for strengthening.];W[np]C[W92 is also a beautiful tesuji.];B[oq];W[nn];B[lk];W[ln];B[lq]LB[ei:a]C[B97 is too hasty, Black can consider to jump at 'a'.]
;W[cg];B[bg];W[bh];B[bf];W[cj]C[White attaches in immediately with W102, leading to a fierce fight, the fight here will decide the outcome of the game.];B[bi];W[ej];B[eh];W[fm];B[fo];W[gj];B[dp];W[cq]
;B[jn];W[lp];B[mq];W[kp];B[ho];W[kl]C[Through B115, the situation is still unclear.];B[il];W[ll];B[cc];W[cb];B[ij];W[dh];B[di]
;W[ei];B[fc]LB[fh:a][gh:b][gi:c]C[B125 is an asking move, the variation here is very complicated, locally White already can't answer any more, if Black loses this game, B125 most likely will be the losing move, here Black can extend out at 'a', if White blocks at 'b', Black can wedge at 'c', escaping out by sacrificing, however Black is very thin and may be still very dangerous.];W[fh]LB[gh:a][gi:b]C[W126 is inevitable, because Black's shape on the right side is not complete, Black seems to have no way to kill White's five stones at the top.];B[eb];W[db];B[fd];W[je]
;B[le]C[B131: After the game, Zhou Heyang said that he should have played this sente move long time back, in the game he thought it was absolute sente and wanted to reserve it, but never got a chance later, and that's the losing cause of this game!];W[jf];B[me];W[jg]LB[kd:a]C[W134: If White makes compromise by playing at 'a', it also would be a close game with White having a slight advantage.];B[ld];W[nd]LB[ih:a]C[W136: If White makes the diagonal at 'a', it will lead to an exchange, White is also a little favorable. In the game, with the connection of W136, perhaps White sees that Black on the left already is hard to escape.];B[lg];W[jb];B[ka]
;W[pa];B[hh];W[kh];B[mc];W[mb];B[ob];W[oa];B[lh];W[ih]C[Through W148, Black instead suddenly dies.];B[ii];W[hi];B[ib];W[ia]
