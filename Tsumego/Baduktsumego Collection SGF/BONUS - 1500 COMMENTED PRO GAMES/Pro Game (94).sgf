cyclic quadruple ko, no result game.];B[qd]C[After several twists and turns, it surprisingly evolves into a "no result" game, I didn't expect this result before the game. This is also the first "no result" game in my professional career.];W[dc];B[pp];W[dp];B[de]

;W[ce];B[dd];W[dg];B[cq]C[B35 entering the corner is a little unreasonable, since here Black is not favorable in ladder breaker.];W[bo];B[er];W[eq];B[dq];W[fr];B[ep];W[bn];B[bm];W[do]
;B[eo]C[I once played the following variation through B45 against Lee Changho in 2002 Nong Shim Cup Ring Contest.];W[cm]LB[en:a]C[From W46, it starts to vary, in that Nong Shim Cup game, I played at 'a', in terms of the result, it was not good, so I elected to cut with W46.];B[dm];W[cl];B[bl];W[en];B[em];W[fn]C[Through W52, Black seems to have incurred loss.];B[qi];W[ph];B[bp]

;B[ld];W[mq];B[mp]LB[mr:a]C[B71: Black perhaps should hane down at 'a', the play in the game is too strong and unyielding, probably considering this is an invitational game, Lee Changho also wants to make this game a little "good-looking".];W[np];B[mr];W[oq];B[lq];W[op];B[pn];W[pm];B[on];W[nr]C[W80: White starts the ko, Black is very difficult to find ko threats.]

;W[ie]LB[id:a][dl:b]C[W106: When White plays the shoulder-hit over B21, Black is already difficult to handle both sides. White wants to push at 'a' and also play at 'b' to escape W46 and W48 in the ladder.];B[di]LB[dl:a]C[At this juncture, Lee Changho releases the good move of B107! In sente, Black wants to handle the hidden trouble of White's escaping at 'a'.];W[dj];B[cj];W[ei];B[dh];W[ch];B[eh];W[eg]
;B[fh];W[fg];B[gg];W[ff];B[kr]LB[fi:a]C[But the original move of B119 should be to capture W110 at 'a'.];W[id];B[ic];W[hc];B[hb];W[ej];B[gh];W[gj]C[After White connects and jumps out with W124 and W126, Black's three groups in the lower-left corner, left side and upper side are all not stable, White is already favorable for the game.]

;W[ij];B[je];W[fe]LB[jf:a]C[W142 is a big bad move! It can be said that this is the losing move of the game! White certainly should hane at 'a'!];B[jf]C[After Black retreats with B143, Black's two groups connect thickly, and Black also aims at White's center group, suddenly White's situation is not optimistic.];W[il];B[hk];W[ii];B[ik];W[jk];B[jl];W[jh]

;B[ll]C[B177: If Black makes life directly in the lower-left corner, White wouldn't have any chance. In the game, Black takes one stone with B177, giving White some chances.];W[ig]C[The atari of W178 perhaps is to Lee Changho's surprise.];B[aj];W[ag];B[br];W[dr]C[But, W182 is a careless move!

;W[fp];B[fk]C[Black lives the corner in sente, and also grabs the eye-related vital point with B189!];W[ib];B[hj];W[hi]C[W192: White wastes one move.];B[jc];W[gb];B[hd];W[he];B[hf];W[gd];B[li]C[After Black captures White's big dragon with B199, Black already establishes superiority.]
;W[bb]C[In the following process, I just try to hang there and see what to happen in the endgame, as a result, due to time pressure, Lee Changho didn't have time to make situational judgement, so he started ko with me, surprisingly it forms cyclic quadruple ko, indeed this only happens once in every hundred years!];B[jb];W[ha];B[sn];W[sm];B[so];W[kp];B[lp];W[lm];B[kn];W[kj];B[hh];W[lj]

In fact, in the postgame analysis, professionals have calculated, if Black connects at 'd' now and gives the ko at 'a' and 'b' all to White, Black will still win the game by 2.5 points by Chinese rules. Since each side only has 50 minutes total time to finish the game and both had only 1 minute left at the end of game, so Lee Changho (Black) didn't have time to calculate precisely how big advantage he had!];B[nf];W[mq]
