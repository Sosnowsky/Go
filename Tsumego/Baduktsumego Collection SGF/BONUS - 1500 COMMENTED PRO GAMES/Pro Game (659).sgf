;W[nc];B[pf];W[kd];B[fq];W[eq]LB[dn:a]C[The diagonal extension of W12 is not good, White should jump to 'a'.];B[fp];W[dn];B[io]C[Due to the addition of B13, the diagonal attack of B15 is very powerful.];W[jo];B[jn];W[kn]
;B[ko]C[The hane of B17 and the cut of B19 carry out the plan of B15, White sinks into passivity.
];W[in];B[jm];W[lq];B[ln];W[kp];B[lo];W[ip];B[ho];W[hp];B[go];W[mq]C[White has no choice but to play this way with the sequence from W26 to W30.]
;B[el]C[B31 is a good point.];W[dl];B[ek];W[dk];B[ej]C[Through B35, Black's outside influence is splendid.];W[qo];B[op];W[pm]LB[rq:a]C[W38: White should make the knight's move at 'a', building a base right away.];B[qp];W[po];B[no]
;W[rk];B[qi];W[ri]C[W44: For White to bump at 'a' is better.]LB[qk:a];B[rm]C[B45 is the vital point for attacking.];W[qh];B[qj];W[rj];B[ql]C[Through B49, White's three stones get captured, Black is leading in territory.];W[ph];B[rg]C[The knight's move of B51 is a good point.]
;W[oj];B[pl];W[rh];B[nl];W[pb];B[qc];W[dj];B[ei];W[ng];B[nr]C[With the knight's move of B61, Black first exploits White and gains some profit.];W[nq];B[or];W[gr]
;B[fr];W[hr]C[White has no choice but to make life with W64 and W66, the lower left corner is damaged.];B[ls];W[jr];B[qf]C[Black reinforces with B69, it is a conservative play in a favorable situation.];W[nk];B[mk];W[mj];B[ml]LB[lk:a]C[B73: Black should extend at 'a'.];W[rp];B[rq]
;W[ol];B[ok];W[nj];B[om];W[rl];B[qm]C[B81 is an impulsive, it incurs two-point loss in the endgame, Black should play at 'a'.]LB[qn:a];W[di];B[fc]C[Because Black's several moves are not appropriate, White catches up a lot, but the situation is still to Black's advantage.];W[hc];B[cc];W[dc]
;B[cd];W[ce];B[db];W[de];B[ec]LB[eb:a][gb:b]C[B91 hitting on White's thick wall is not good. Black should retreats at 'a', this way W 'b' is not sente.];W[gb];B[nf];W[mg];B[fb];W[fn];B[cq]
;W[er];B[eo]C[The exchange of B97 with W98 is clearly damaging for Black, but in exchange, Black gets to peep with B99 and obtains the compensation.];W[cp];B[en];W[em];B[fm];W[dm];B[eh];W[cg];B[lj]LB[mc:a][ib:b]C[B107: Black can consider to probe White by attaching at 'a' or playing at 'b'.]
;W[pp];B[qq];W[sm];B[sn];W[sl];B[rn];W[ii]C[The play of W114 in the center shows White's sharpness of fighting for a victory.];B[ki]LB[lh:a][ig:b][kf:c]C[The diagonal extension of B115 is too conservative, Black's favorable consciousness is too heavy. Black should jump to 'a', White can only jump to 'b', then Black plays the knight's move at 'c', White is not easy to handle.];W[ik]
;B[hl]C[B117: Black continues to be conservative, now Black has to strike back.];W[ig]C[After the jump of W118, Black's advantage is completely gone.];B[es];W[ds];B[fs];W[dr];B[mi];W[lh]C[W124: White elects to sacrifice four stones, White already calculates precisely.];B[oi];W[oh];B[ni];W[me]C[After White plays W128, already Black almost doesn't have any chance to fight for a win.]
