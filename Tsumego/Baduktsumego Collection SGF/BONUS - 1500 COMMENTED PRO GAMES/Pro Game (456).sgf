;W[qk];B[qn];W[qh];B[qf];W[oh];B[db];W[cc];B[hd];W[fq];B[ng]C[The opening up to B17 is same as that in the game 2.];W[oc]C[W18: White starts to vary.];B[pc]
;W[pb];B[od]LB[qb:a][pf:b]C[B21: If White blocks at 'a', then White will attach at 'b', White would already have taken advantage.];W[qc];B[pd];W[rb];B[rc]LB[ob:a]C[B25: Black can also consider to cut at 'a'.];W[qb];B[nc];W[ob]
;B[nb];W[rd];B[re];W[sc]C[Through W32, White has made life smoothly.];B[nh];W[kq]LB[ch:a]C[W34: White should play on the left side, but where to play is hard to select, however no matter which place to play, it is always better than letting White to force at 'a' first.];B[ch];W[dk];B[eh];W[ff]C[With W36 and W38, White wants to stick his head out and also take the side, but after being attached at 'a', White is painful! Lee Changho's tolerance ability is very good!];B[bf]
;W[be];B[df];W[ce]C[W42: If I were playing, at any rate I wouldn't connect but to hit at 'a' instead.]LB[cg:a];B[ef];W[gj]C[W44 is a good and light move.];B[ed];W[gh];B[cb];W[di];B[dh];W[bg]
;B[fi];W[gi];B[ek]C[Black has to get out with the crude moves of B51 and B53, Black also has paid a price in the attack.];W[dm];B[jp]C[B55 is inevitable.];W[kp];B[jo];W[ko];B[jn];W[ir]C[The sequence from W56 to W60 is steady.];B[fl];W[jj]LB[gm:a][ji:b][fp:c][gq:d][hq:e][jh:f]C[W62: When Black makes the diagonal of B61, Black over-emphasizes the counterattack at 'a', the original move is to jump to 'b', this way if Black still plays at 'c' and B 'd', next White can crossover with the diagonal move at 'e', even if Black can use for other purposes, but Black is hard to attack White in the center. However in the game, once Black becomes thick, Black's attack at 'f' is severe!]
;B[fp]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.];W[ep];B[gq];W[fo]C[W66: White wants to look after the center, but this move is very damaging to territory.];B[gp];W[nq];B[pj];W[qj]LB[rl:a]C[W70: White should make the diagonal's move at 'a'.];B[pi]LB[jh:a]C[B71: Black should attack White at 'a'.]
;W[jg];B[nr];W[mr];B[rm];W[rl];B[fr];W[dr];B[cq];W[cp];B[hf]C[B81: Black starts to attack now, but it seems Black is one step slow.];W[gm]C[White counterattacks with W82, naturally reinforcing the center.];B[gl]

White should hit at 'a' instead, Black probably will take at 108, White can strengthen to make life by playing at 'b', then Black encloses territory at 'c', this way White in the center would be alive.]
