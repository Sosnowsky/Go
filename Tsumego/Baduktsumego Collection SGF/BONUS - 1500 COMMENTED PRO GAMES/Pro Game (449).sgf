Translation:GoGameWorld.];B[pd]C[In the first two games of the 11th Chinese Xinren Wang final, the series tied at 1:1, this is decisive game 3.];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[cf];W[di]
;B[fd];W[df];B[cc];W[ce];B[dc];W[cg]C[The sequence from B5 to B12 is same as in the game 2, both sides feel they are fine, however I think Qiu Jun has done more study on it, because in the Mingren title match, he used this approach to defeat Yu Bin 9p.
];B[fq];W[dn];B[ip]LB[fo:a]C[The one-space less extension of B15 is an improvement to the game 2, but after this move, Black loses the good jump at 'a', which makes this improvement unsuccessful.];W[kq];B[jq]
;W[ko];B[in];W[po];B[oo]C[As to the corner-approach of W20, the attachment of B21 is an inevitable counterattack.];W[qq];B[op];W[pn];B[on];W[pm];B[om]LB[qr:a][qp:b][km:c]C[Next B27 is a very early mistake, Black should play hane at 'a', then W 'b' and B 'c'.]
;W[pl];B[qr];W[km]C[In the game, the jump of W30 is the right move.];B[qp];W[pi]LB[qg:a][jc:b]C[W32 is again a good move to obtain sente, making miai of the two points 'a' and 'b', Black is sure to get one.];B[qg];W[fc]C[The attachment of W34 looks like following a set pattern, which is Qiu Jun's study result. No matter how Black answers, White will be all not bad.];B[gc];W[ec];B[ed]
;W[gb];B[hc];W[db];B[hb];W[cb];B[fb];W[eb];B[ga];W[ge];B[gd];W[bc]C[The variation up to W48 is the way Yu Bin once played with Black, but White gains a big territory.];B[oh]C[B49: Black has to expand his moyo in a big scale, because now the situation is already not to Black's advantage.]
;W[oi];B[nh];W[rh]C[W50 and W52 are cool-headed.];B[rn]LB[rg:a][ob:b]C[B53: If Black blocks at 'a', then White would settle himself first and take sente, next White can invade at 'b'.];W[rg]C[White crawls with W54 in sente, White can be satisfied.];B[qe];W[rm];B[jk]LB[ll:a][im:b][kk:c]C[Next B57 looks like an inevitable move, but in fact this move is just the root cause of Black's failure! After White calmly makes the diagonal extension and then attaches out at 'b', Black already can't find any severe follow-up maneuver for attacking. Black should cap at 'c' instead, enclosing a big territory at the top while attacking White, this way Black would have a chance to fight with White.]
;W[ll];B[jn]C[With the sequence following B59, Black pushes and cuts Black's two stones, it is too small!];W[lj];B[kn];W[ln];B[lo]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.];W[ob]C[After the jump of W60, White plays the reduction move of W64, Black's territory appears apparently not adequate.
];B[oc];W[pb];B[nb]LB[mc:a]C[B67: Black should jump to 'a' instead, White dares not extend at 67, this would be better for Black.]

;B[lp];W[mp]C[Due to the reason of ko threats, after the attachment of W82, Black can't start the ko, the value of capturing two stones is not big.];B[lq];W[mq];B[lr];W[ki];B[kh];W[kj];B[jh];W[mi];B[ni];W[mm];B[cq]LB[nj:a]C[B93 is inexplicable! Black should extend out at 'a', White dares not act rashly.]
;W[dq];B[bp];W[bo];B[dr];W[ie];B[nj];W[ff]C[In the game White ataris with W90 then connects back with W100, Black's big territory has been compressed, White is happy to win the game.];B[je]LB[qn:a]C[B101: Black should bump at 'a', however now White is already not difficult to handle.];W[lh];B[lg];W[ro]LB[pp:a]C[In the game, after the clamp of W104, the squeezing move at 'a' is effective, this is simple and clear for White.]

;W[cp];B[ek]LB[dl:a]C[B199 seems more like a winning play, now Black can only play at 'a' in order to have a chance of winning.];W[ap];B[bq];W[ck]C[After the knight's crossover of W122, Black never gets winning chances again, this game is a complete victory for White.];B[ei];W[eq];B[er];W[fp];B[dh];W[dj]
