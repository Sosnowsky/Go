;B[cf]C[The opening up to B19 is steady from both sides.];W[qf]LB[nc:a][qm:b]C[W20: The common move is to approach the corner at 'a' from this direction, the play in the game is a trend, aiming to invade at 'b' next.];B[qe];W[pf];B[nc];W[qi];B[cn]LB[ok:a]C[B25 is slow! Black should first attack at 'a' instead and also indirectly guard against White's invasion.];W[fp];B[bp]
;W[qm]C[After White invades with W28, Black already has no time to attack White.];B[pl];W[qo];B[qp];W[pn];B[oo];W[rp];B[rq];W[rn];B[on];W[pm];B[om];W[sq]
;B[sr];W[sp];B[qr]C[From B29 to B43, White makes life in sente, Black still has cut points on the outside, White is already one step ahead in the opening.];W[cq];B[dl];W[eg]LB[cj:a][kc:b]C[W46 is of favorable consciousness. White should invade at 'a' instead, and get chance to make two-extension at 'b'.];B[kc]C[Black's sequence following B47 is positive.];W[re];B[rd];W[rf]
;B[fe];W[fb];B[df];W[ef];B[dh]C[Through B55, Black encloses territory, the game again goes back to the starting point.];W[dk]C[White makes the situation chaotic with W56, but it is not necessarily to White's advantage.];B[el];W[cl];B[cm];W[eh];B[di];W[ei]
;B[ck];W[rc]LB[qc:a]C[W64: White certainly should directly strike at 'a', forcing Black to settle the shape.];B[he]LB[kd:a]C[B65 is a relentless move, Black starts to attack White instead, White can't find a good counter tactic while fighting on bakc of his own thickness. W64 looks like the problem, instead White can consider to press at 'a' to expand.];W[jd]LB[cj:a][dj:b][ek:c][bl:d][dg:e][cg:f][ce:g][be:h][bf:i][bg:j][ej:k][ch:l]C[Before W66, White should first exchange the sequence from W 'a' to B 'l'.]
;B[gc];W[hb]LB[jc:a]C[W68: White is too convenient! White certainly should counterattack by blocking at 'a'.];B[hh];W[kd];B[lc];W[qc];B[pc];W[cj]C[White already has no chance to do the exchange following W74.];B[dj];W[ek];B[bl]
;W[dg];B[cg];W[ce];B[be];W[bf]C[During the process, W82 is order, taking endgame advantage.];B[bg];W[ej];B[ch];W[gg]C[White makes a small jump of W86 on the back of a six-stone wall, it is too inexplicable!];B[if];W[hd];B[gp]
;W[gq];B[hq]C[B89 and B91: Black presses White by using his thickness.];W[gr];B[hg]C[B93: Black doesn't give an inch, Black becomes braver with the fight.];W[hj];B[go];W[hr];B[ji];W[ii]C[The sequence following W98 is game-deciding moves, but White is fraught with grim possibilities.];B[jh];W[jj];B[kj]
;W[ki];B[li];W[jg];B[ih];W[kh];B[kg];W[lh];B[kf];W[mh];B[ee]LB[gj:a]C[After the cut of B111, Black can attach at 'a', however White is not alive at the top, White sinks into a difficult situation.];W[ie]C[W112 is a vital tesuji.]
;B[gf];W[jf];B[jk];W[ij];B[gd]C[But after B113 and B117, Black basically already makes life, White is still difficult to look after both sides.];W[kk];B[lj];W[lk];B[gb];W[ga];B[gj];W[gk];B[gi]
;W[mj];B[fk]C[With B125 and B127, Black captures a few stones in sente, White is already losing big.];W[fl];B[fj];W[me];B[ol];W[qb];B[pb];W[gl];B[fm];W[gm];B[fo];W[eo]
