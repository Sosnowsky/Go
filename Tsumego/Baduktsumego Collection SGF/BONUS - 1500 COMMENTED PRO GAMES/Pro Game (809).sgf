;B[oc];W[fd];B[cn];W[cl]LB[fq:a][ed:b]C[W10: If White answer at 'a', then Black probably will wedge at 'b'.];B[cq];W[cp];B[dq];W[ep];B[bp];W[bo];B[bq]
;W[co];B[fq];W[qj]LB[gc:a]C[W20: For White to bump at 'a' is also very big.];B[qm];W[qg];B[cc]LB[ed:a]C[B23 entering the corner is the correct move, to wedge at 'a' is not right timing.];W[dc];B[cd];W[ce];B[be]
;W[cb]LB[cf:a][bf:b][cg:c][db:d][eb:e]C[W28: If White extends at 'a', then B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e' and B28, Black is very happy to live in the corner, White can't be satisfied.];B[cf]LB[bb:a][bf:b]C[B29: If Black plays hane at 'a', then White can play double-hane at 'b'.];W[de];B[bn];W[dn]C[Black's sequence following B31 is light and nimble.]
;B[dm];W[cm];B[en];W[an];B[do];W[bm];B[fp];W[bb];B[ci];W[dl];B[gd]LB[gc:a][fe:b][ed:c]C[The hane of B43 is very unreasonable! Black hopes White to cut at 'a', then B 'b' and White connects at 'c', Black can take advantage in sente, but it is only Black's wishful thinking.]
;W[hd]C[The counterattack of W44 is inevitable.];B[fe];W[he];B[fg];W[df];B[fk]LB[cg:a][ej:b]C[B49 is a clever move in a rush, showing Luo Xihe's talent. Normally Black will retreat at 'a', next White makes the knight's move at 'b', Black is being separated into two groups, Black will be in a painful fight. In the game, Song TaeKon is clearly puzzled by B49, the atari of W50 is a slow move, White still should play at 'b', Black is still not good.];W[cg];B[dh];W[fo];B[go]
;W[fn];B[gn];W[fm];B[gm];W[lq]C[Through W58, it is still to White's advantage, but Black also crosses over a difficult time.];B[fl];W[em];B[mr]C[B61 is a good move, now Black is not favorable in the game and needs to be more active.];W[oq];B[pq];W[mq];B[nr]
;W[lm]LB[ln:a]C[B66 is the losing move! For White to jump at 'a' is the original move.];B[lo]C[B67 is severe! ];W[mo];B[mn];W[ln];B[ko];W[nn];B[mp];W[mm];B[np]C[B75: Black captures three stones and suddenly makes a big territory, White is already in a losing trend.];W[fi]C[W76 and W80 shows Korean player's ability to mess up the situation in an inferior situation. If White plays normally, it equals to accepting defeat.]

;W[hh]C[From B81 to W116, White captures several stones at the top by sacrificing and gains a lot of profit, but White also pays a heavy price, the situation is still to Black's advantage.];B[if]LB[pk:a]C[B117: Black loses common sense! Black most likely will die in gote, Black should play at 'a' to capture seven white stones.];W[li];B[mi];W[mh];B[ni];W[kj]LB[nh:a][mc:b]C[W122: For White to press at 'a' will put more pressure on Black, later on White can capture Black's much bigger group by playing at 'b', this way the outcome of the game will be hard to imagine.];B[kk];W[lk]

;B[pe]LB[le:a][pl:b]C[After B149, 'a' and 'b' become miai, Black must get one, White loses the game for sure.];W[le];B[pl];W[rk];B[gi];W[gh];B[dk];W[dj];B[lc];W[md];B[od]
