;W[ee];B[ef];W[ed];B[nc];W[eq];B[df]LB[dg:a][ce:b]C[B11: Black needs to hang at 'a', if White clamps at 'b', Black's shape would be much thicker.];W[cd];B[gf];W[hd]LB[bf:a]C[Although B11 and B13 are sente, but to exchange with W12 and W14 is very territory-damaging. After White makes the knight's move at 'a', Black is cumbersome as a whole.]
;B[po];W[qj];B[ql];W[qg];B[ck];W[cm]C[W20 is calm.];B[jq]LB[dd:a][cc:b][be:c]C[B21: If Black pushes at 'a', then W 'b' and B 'c', White can grab the central point at 21.];W[bf]C[With the knight's move of W22, White not only has gained territory but also snatched away Black's base, White is very happy.];B[jd]
;W[hq];B[jo];W[oj];B[ol];W[qq]LB[qp:a][pr:b]C[W28 is clever! Black is difficult. If Black hangs at 'a', then White will hane at 'b', Black is still painful.];B[pr];W[qp];B[pp];W[rn]C[In the game, Black elects to descend with B29, after the extension of W30 and the knight's move of W32, Black is still facing a difficult problem.];B[pi]LB[rm:a][qn:b][rr:c][om:d]C[B33: From state of mind, Black should make the diagonal's extension at 'a', after W 'b', Black can enter the corner at 'c' to kill White, but this way White can attach at 'd', whether Black can kill White is hard to draw a conclusion.]
;W[pj];B[rk]C[B35: Perhaps Xie He has no certainty of success, so he turns to the right side.];W[qr]C[White has succeeded. After the block of W36, White has turned Black's corner into his own and obtained 30-point profit, however for Black to get the same amount of profit from the right side is really very difficult.];B[qi]
(;W[oi]LB[ri:a][rj:b][ph:c][og:d][rh:e][oh:f]C[W38 is a careless move. White should first play the hane at 'a', after B 'b', then White turns at 38. If Black turns at 'c', then W 'd', B 'e' and W 'f', Black is not necessarily favorable (see var a).];B[ri];W[og];B[oe]LB[oh:a][nh:b][ph:c][nf:d]C[B41 attacking White as a whole is the right choice. If playing the wedge and atari at 'a', then W 'b', B 'c' and W 'd', White can fight by sacrifice.]
;W[qc];B[rd];W[nl]LB[lj:a]C[W44: The original move for White is to reinforce at around 'a'. Chang Hao perhaps thinks that even if he plays there, White is still not good, so he elects to play at 44 to seek the playing tempo.];B[nm];W[ml];B[mj]C[After Black strikes with B47, White is a little dangerous.];W[mi];B[li];W[lj];B[mh];W[ni]
;B[lk];W[kj];B[mk]TR[lj][kj]C[B53 and B55 is strong and unyielding! Because White can't give up the marked two stones, White as a whole is very burdensome.];W[nk];B[lh];W[rj];B[sj];W[mm];B[kk];W[jj];B[km]LB[qn:a][qo:b][pm:c]C[B63 is an impulsive move. Black should first make the diagonal's extension at 'a', exchanging with W 'b', then jump to 63. Probably Xie He feels that 'a' and 'c' are miai, Black is always safe, but he didn't expect that Chang Hao plays the clever sequence from W74 to W82 creating a ko, Black already has no way to kill White.]
