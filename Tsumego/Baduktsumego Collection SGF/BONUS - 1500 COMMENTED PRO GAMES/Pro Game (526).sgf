;W[hq]LB[kq:a]C[W6: White prevents Black from forming the "Mini Chinese" fuseki by playing at 'a'.];B[nq]C[B7 protecting the corner is a good point.];W[eq]LB[fp:a]C[W8: For White to play at 'a' is also playable.];B[cj]LB[qj:a]C[B9: If Black plays at a', it would lead to a territory race.];W[qj];B[cg];W[fc];B[fp]
;W[cn];B[jq];W[nc];B[qf];W[qm]C[The sequence of W16 and W18 is a playing tempo.];B[hp]C[B19: Black has many selections, the play in the game is relatively simple.];W[fr];B[gr];W[er]C[When Black presses with B19, White doesn't hesitate to play the hane and connection of W20 and W22, it is very big.];B[pk];W[pj];B[pm]C[With B23 and B25, Black is undisguised to expand his moyo.]
;W[qq]C[W26: White enters the corner to probe Black, representing Luo Xihe's nimble style.];B[qn]C[B27 is the strongest answer, which leads to a fierce fight.];W[pp];B[rp];W[np];B[oq];W[pq];B[mp];W[mo]C[W34 is a good move, Black dare not fight back.];B[lp];W[rl]C[W36 is a both offensive and defensive play.]
;B[pn];W[rq];B[pr]C[B39: Black certainly doesn't want White to make life immediately.];W[qr];B[or];W[rn];B[ro]LB[qo:a][sr:b]C[B43: Black can't connect at 'a', otherwise White will be left with a ko crossover after the diagonal's extension at 'b'.];W[nm]C[W44 is the best strengthening move.];B[ok];W[no]C[Through 46, White can be satisfied.]
;B[ql];W[rm];B[qk];W[rk];B[ri];W[qh];B[rh];W[rj];B[lm]C[B55 is a vital point for attacking White, Black tries to conduct a two-pronged attack.];W[po];B[qo];W[ml];B[nj]
;W[oh]LB[nh:a]C[W60 seems no better than a move at 'a', that way White is much smoother to stick his head out.];B[nh];W[ol];B[pl];W[ll]C[W64: White certainly should first handle this group.];B[ng];W[pf];B[qe]C[Through this move, Luo Xihe has used 20 minutes and Choi Cheolhan 40 minutes.];W[of];B[me];W[od]
;B[pc];W[mf]LB[ld:a]C[W72: The pros in the study room think that for White to play the knight's move at 'a' should be satisfactory.];B[nf];W[ne];B[lf]LB[md:a][ni:b]C[If B75 at 'a', then White will play the wedge at 'b', Black is dangerous.];W[md];B[le];W[kd]C[Through 78, Black has obtained some territory in the upper right, White's big dragon in the lower right is still not stable, the situation is unclear.];B[kn]C[B79 is a little slow, because Black doesn't gain much territory.]
;W[mj];B[mi];W[lj];B[jf];W[ob]LB[id:a]C[W84 is kind of double sente move, not less valuable than a move at 'a'.];B[id];W[qb];B[pb];W[pa];B[rb];W[ce]C[W90 is the last big point, it seems White is favorable.]
;B[cm]C[With the attachment of B9, Black aims to take advantage in sente.];W[bm]LB[dn:a]C[The counterattack of W92 takes a big risk, to tolerate at 'a' is safe.];B[bn]C[B93 is a good move.];W[dm]LB[bo:a][dn:b][bl:c]C[W94: White strikes back bravely, if White plays the atari at 'a', Black will atari at 'b' and 'c', White can't tolerate.];B[co];W[dn];B[bo]
;W[cl];B[cr]C[B99 is a tesuji for making life.];W[do];B[bq]C[Through 101, Black has gained.];W[hr];B[gq];W[gs];B[iq];W[ej]C[W106: White hopes to find some chance in the attack.];B[ei]LB[eg:a]C[B107 is a dangerous move, normally Black will play at 'a'.]
;W[dh]C[W108 is surprisingly relentless, it seems White doesn't think that the game is to his advantage.];B[ek]C[B109: Black doesn't want to give way, the fight over here will directly affect the outcome of the game.];W[fj];B[dj];W[ch]C[W122: White takes advantage first, fighting with Black by the life and death of the big dragon at the bottom.];B[fk];W[gj];B[dk]LB[dl:a]C[B115 perhaps should be at 'a', the play in the game leaves White some room for making eyes.];W[fo];B[gk]
;W[bk];B[bj];W[bh];B[fn]C[B121: Black aims to force White to live.];W[go];B[gp];W[ho];B[ip];W[fm];B[gn];W[hl]C[W128: White has separated Black, turning Black into the "defendant".];B[hn]
;W[in];B[io];W[fh]C[W132 is fierce and brutal, Black is relatively more dangerous.];B[hk];W[dl]C[After White makes life completely with W134, White's advantage is clear.];B[bg]C[B135 makes the last-ditch struggle.];W[jl]C[W136: White doesn't want to leave Black any chance.];B[kk];W[kl];B[gl];W[il]
;B[ak]C[B141: Black seeks a way of conceding defeat.];W[al];B[aj];W[gm];B[hm];W[en];B[eo];W[hj];B[ck];W[bl];B[ik];W[ij];B[jk]
;W[jj];B[kj];W[ki];B[li];W[ji]C[W158: White simply wins the game.])
