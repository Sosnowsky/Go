;W[cp]C[Of course, Yu Bin 9p already has studied thoroughly on this opening, W4 and W6 are just the moves to counter it.];B[ep];W[eq]C[When Black approaches with B7, Yu Bin is very comfortable to attach with W8, since Cho U almost never play the avalanche joseki.];B[fq];W[dq];B[oc]LB[dd:a]C[B11 protecting the corner is a little slow, Black has the state of mind to bump at 'a', making W2 a damaging move.];W[cb]C[W12: White first strikes in the upper left corner, obtaining the empty corner.];B[cd];W[gc]C[W14 making two-space extension is Yu Bin's favorite.
];B[bb]
;W[jc]C[After White again makes two-space extension with W16, Black's worry-free corner in the upper right corner loses the possibility of expanding to both sides, White obtains balance in the situation.];B[nq];W[qn];B[pr]LB[fp:a][cn:b][jp:c]C[Black flies into the corner with B19, more stressing on territory, if Black connects at 'a', then W 'b' and B 'c', this is a common variation.];W[fp];B[qq];W[qk];B[cj];W[gq]
;B[qi];W[qp];B[pm];W[qm];B[kc];W[kd];B[lc]C[The attachment of B29 and B31 are unexpected.];W[jd]C[In the current configuration, White becomes thick with W30 and W32, Black appears disintegrated for the whole game.];B[cm];W[db];B[kq]LB[dh:a][lq:b]C[B35: Black wants very much to strengthen at 'a', but Black is also reluctant to give Black the last big point of forcing at 'b', Black is a little difficult.]
;W[dg]C[After White invades with W36, the thickness formed by W30 and W32 gets fully utilized, White's opening is successful.];B[gd];W[hc];B[fg]LB[ef:a][bg:b]C[Black caps with B39, selling a "defect", if White pierces through at 'a', Black will fly over at 'b'.];W[di];B[bh];W[cf];B[fe];W[dl];B[fi]LB[dj:a][ck:b]C[B45: Black hopes White to press at 'a', then Black will extend at 'b'.]
;W[bi]C[In the game, the crosscut of W46 is an alert good move.];B[ci];W[ch];B[bj]LB[bg:a]C[B49: If Black extends at 'a', White will crawl at 49, Black is not good.];W[bg];B[ai];W[dj]C[White gets to stick the head out with W52.];B[fc];W[fb];B[fk]C[B55: Black tries to keep attacking White, but it is a little unreasonable.]
;W[ef];B[ee];W[ff]C[W56 and W58 are sharp.];B[gf];W[gg];B[hf];W[fh]C[W62: White simply takes one stone.];B[gh];W[eg];B[hg];W[gi]C[White again separates Black with W66, the game enters into middle game fight, which is to White's advantage.];B[fg]

;B[dm]LB[cl:a]C[B81: For Black to atari at 'a' is good timing.];W[em]LB[fm:a][el:b][gm:c][fn:d][fo:e]C[W82: White can't play hane at 'a', because Black can bump at 82, next W 'b', B 'c', W 'd' and B 'e'.];B[fm];W[en];B[fn];W[be];B[cl]C[B87: Now the atari is already not sente any more.]
;W[ji]C[W88: White turns to fight in the center, White's judgement is right.];B[dk];W[bd]C[W90 is related to eye shape of both sides and can't be omitted.];B[kg];W[jk];B[lh];W[rd]C[W94: White starts to invade the upper right corner, this will be the last battle field.];B[qc];W[qg];B[oi];W[qe];B[rf]
;W[rg];B[qf];W[pf];B[re];W[ri]C[Through W104, White crosses over successfully, White still keeps advantage.];B[pe];W[pq];B[rr];W[rq];B[qr];W[qj]LB[li:a]C[W110: For White to attach at 'a' is more effective.]

;W[in];B[im];W[jl];B[fr]LB[gr:a][hk:b][gk:c][hm:d][gm:e][gp:f]C[When B127, Black sets up a trap, if White blocks at 'a', then B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e' and B 'f', White's key stones will be captured (see var a).]
(;W[jg];B[jf];W[kf]C[W128 and W130: White doesn't fall for the trap, sending Black into hopeless situation.];B[jh];W[kh];B[ig];W[lg];B[lf];W[jg];B[gk];W[hk]LB[kg:a][gr:b]C[W138: For White to eliminate the ko at 'a' is the simplest play, next Black takes at 138, White will block at 'b'.]
;B[kg];W[mc];B[mg];W[nb]LB[gr:a]C[In the game, although the ko threat of W140 and W142 is a little small (because for Black to turn at 'a' is also a very big move).];B[gr];W[gp];B[er];W[dr];B[eo];W[bn]C[But through W148, White's victory still can't be altered.];B[jo]
