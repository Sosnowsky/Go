Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[pd]C[In the game 1 of the challenger best-of-3 final of Mingren Title, Luo Xihe 9p (White) defeated Yu Bin 9p by resignation, leading 1:0 in the series.];W[dd];B[qp];W[dp];B[fq]
;W[cn];B[kq];W[qj];B[pk];W[qk];B[pl]LB[ql:a]C[The retreat of B11 is popular in Korea recently, in the past,  it was always the hane at 'a', this local variation again is a new topic for study.];W[ql];B[qm];W[pj];B[pm];W[qf];B[nc]
;W[nj]C[Through W18, both sides elect relatively steady plays.];B[cf]LB[dr:a][cq:b][hp:c]C[B19: Black can also consider to make the knight's move at 'a', next W 'b' and B 'c'.];W[ch];B[cc];W[dc]LB[cd:a][ed:b][bd:c][be:d][bc:e][ce:f][fc:g][hq:h]C[The blocking direction of W22 is surprising, this is Luo Xihe's unique thinking, normally White will elect to block at 'a', next B22, W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 'e', W 'f', B 'g', then White can invade at 'h'. Generally White will block with W22 if already making extension on the side.]

;W[ep];B[er];W[bq];B[fp];W[gr];B[fr];W[ho];B[fn];W[hm];B[fl]C[Through B45, White's configuration on the left side is not good, however White obtains compensation in the lower right corner.];W[pq];B[qq];W[mq]
;B[lp];W[mp];B[ln];W[qr];B[rr];W[pr];B[hk];W[km]C[Through W56, it can be said this is a very balanced situation for both sides.];B[dl];W[bl];B[dn]LB[cl:a][co:b][fo:c]C[B57 and B59 are bad moves. First with B57 Black wants to block at 'a', next after the exchange of B59 and W 'b', Black adds the defect at 'c'.]
;W[co];B[lm]LB[mo:a]C[B61: Black should hang at 'a', in the real game, White crosses over, Black fails badly.];W[pp];B[qo];W[jp];B[mo];W[ir]C[W64 and W66 become sente, this is due to the mistake of B59.];B[jq];W[lq];B[kp];W[kr]
;B[gp];W[hp];B[hc];W[qd];B[qc];W[pc]C[W74 and W76 are very tight.];B[qe];W[rd];B[pe];W[re];B[pf]LB[qb:a]C[B81: If Black ataris at 'a', White will attach up at 81, Black is not comfortable. In the real game, the exchange following B81 is also not to Black's advantage.]

;B[oh];W[ne];B[oj];W[rm];B[rn];W[sl]C[Through W98 and W100, White makes life, Black's territory is already inadequate.];B[bk]C[Black perhaps realizes his situation is not good, the attachment of B101 is clearly unreasonable, Black still wants to fight strongly.];W[cl];B[ck];W[dk]C[But White hits and cuts with W102 and W104, Black sinks into a bitter battle.];B[ci]C[The sequence from B105 to B119 is perhaps Yu Bin's miscalculation. He overlooks White's good knight's move of W120, Black suddenly collapses.]
;W[el];B[dm];W[ek];B[di];W[fm];B[em]LB[gm:a]C[B111: Black can only atari at 'a', however after White captures three stones by playing at 111, Black's situation is also already way behind.];W[gm];B[eo];W[do];B[fk];W[cm];B[en]
