;W[od];B[md]C[B7 appears very frequently in the recent games.];W[of];B[qf];W[qc]C[W10: White has many choices, the play in the game is simple and clear.];B[rc];W[pc];B[re]LB[rb:a][kc:b][le:c][mb:d]C[B13: If Black extends at 'a', then White will play the counter-pincer at 'b', then B 'c' and W 'd', White can cross over.]
;W[mc]C[W14 is the tic-for-tat move of B13.];B[lc];W[ld];B[mb];W[nc];B[kc]C[B17 and B19 are steady moves.];W[le];B[kd]C[B21 is tight.];W[lf]LB[kf:a]C[W22 prevents Black from playing the cap move at 'a'.];B[gd]C[Through B23, Black can be satisfied.]
;W[cm];B[jq];W[lq];B[er]LB[gq:a][eq:b][fq:c][fp:d][hq:e]C[B27 is a move to seek a high efficiency, if Black makes the two-space extension at 'a', then White will play at 'b', Black can't be satisfied, if Black approaches the corner at 'c', then White will play at 'b', after B 'd', White can immediately invade at 'e', the fight is not to Black's advantage.];W[eq];B[dr];W[gq]LB[fr:a][fq:b]C[W30 is the right move, if White plays the hane at 'a', then Black will cut at 'b', White is hard to handle.]
;B[fq];W[fp];B[fr];W[cq];B[hq];W[gp];B[gr];W[cg]C[The invasion of W38 is perfect timing.];B[ce];W[dh];B[cl]C[B41 is a common tactic for managing weak stones, letting White become even thicker is already not bad.];W[bl]
;B[ck];W[bk];B[dm];W[cn];B[di];W[fh];B[fj];W[hh];B[hj];W[qp]LB[qk:a][qq:b]C[W52: If White makes the extension at 'a', then Black will immediately enter the corner to grab territory, White can't be satisfied.];B[qk]
;W[qm];B[oq]LB[nq:a][mq:b]C[B55 is relentless, but it also takes a big risk, to invade at 'a' or attach at 'b' is relatively common.];W[np]C[W56: White is not soft-hearted, Kato sinks into a deep mediation.];B[qr]LB[mq:a]C[B57: Black can also attach at 'a', it would lead to a complicated variation.];W[nq];B[rn]LB[rq:a][pr:b]C[B59: If Black makes the diagonal's extension at 'a', then White will attach at 'b', Black is dangerous. The play in the game is to prepare for the diagonal.]
;W[qn]C[W60 is the right move.];B[ro];W[rp];B[rm];W[qi];B[ql]LB[rq:a][or:b]C[As for the result up to B65, White can be satisfied, however Black is still left with the aji of playing the diagonal extension at 'a' then the descent at 'b'. So far Yu Bin has used 19 minutes and Kato 43 minutes.];W[om]TR[qi]C[W66 prevents Black from playing here, because White is thick at the top, so White is no need to worry that the marked white stone comes under attack.];B[ol];W[oi]
;B[ph];W[pi];B[nm];W[on];B[nk];W[mj]LB[mi:a]C[W74 guards against Black's knight-cap at 'a'.];B[kk]LB[jh:a]C[B75: Black prepares to attack White by playing the cap at 'a'.];W[ji];B[ki];W[kh]
;B[li];W[jj];B[lh]LB[bg:a]C[W80: White aims at Black on the left side, but Black has the tactic of playing the attachment at 'a', so Black is not dangerous.];W[kg];B[lk]LB[ng:a]C[B83: Black first strengthens himself, preparing to separate White at 'a'.];W[pg]C[Through W84, Black has obtained sente and can be satisfied.];B[hf]LB[ie:a]C[B85: For Black to play at 'a' is steady.];W[ie]
;B[if];W[je];B[hc]LB[ih:a][jh:b][ke:c]C[After B89, Black has the maneuver of play at 'a', 'b' or 'c', Kato Masao enters into overtime, Yu Bin has used 35 minutes.];W[he];B[ge];W[de]LB[gf:a]C[W92: White seeks to cut at 'a'.];B[df];W[cf]
;B[ee];W[be];B[dd];W[ei]LB[eh:a]C[W98: White guards against Black's wedge and cut at 'a'.];B[ej];W[bd];B[bc];W[bb];B[cc]C[Through B103, White has gained some territory, Black's territory has been dramatically reduced, but White seems a little weak.];W[bj]C[W104 is a both offensive and defensive play.];B[bi]
;W[ih];B[il]C[W106 and B107: Both sides have strengthened themselves respectively, both moves are original.];W[kr]LB[mr:a]C[W108 is a very big move and also has removed the aji of B 'a'.];B[cr]C[B109 is also a big endgame which can't let slip.];W[fm];B[el];W[ac]LB[cb:a][db:b][ca:c]C[W112 is kind of sente, if Black doesn't answer here, then W 'a', B 'b' and W 'c', this is huge for White, but if Black answers, Black seems to have taken advantage already. So far White is leading in territory, Black must do something in order to win the game.]
;B[dq];W[cp];B[ep];W[eo];B[fo]TR[ac]LB[bq:a]C[B117 is the game-deciding move, from the result, the earlier marked white stone at 'a' would be more steady.];W[eq];B[sp];W[rq]LB[sq:a][so:b][sr:c]C[W120: White must be careful, if White plays the atari at 'a', then B120, W 'b' and B 'c'.]
;B[ep];W[en]C[W122 is a steady move in a favorable situation.];B[nb];W[rb];B[sb];W[cb];B[db];W[ca]C[W126 and W128 are the punishment to Black's tenuki.];B[ho]C[As to the cap of B129, White certainly wouldn't answer it, because Black can't kill White's three stones cleanly with just one move.];W[nn];B[mm];W[ko]C[W130 and W132 are good moves, preventing Black from making territory here.]
;B[sq];W[sr];B[so];W[rr];B[bq];W[bp];B[ar];W[da]C[W140 is very big.];B[ap];W[bo];B[ob]C[Black has no good way to reinforce in the upper left corner, so Black simply takes tenuki.];W[pd]
;B[qb];W[pb];B[ra];W[ng];B[jr];W[rj];B[mn];W[mo];B[ln];W[kp];B[qg];W[qh];B[go]C[B157: The ko is not that severe to White.]

;B[ch];W[ag];B[pa];W[oh];B[fa];W[ic];B[jc];W[id];B[ib];W[rg]C[White is able to grab the big endgame of W180, White's advantage is obvious.];B[jn];W[ai]C[After W182, the komi becomes a heavy burden for Black.]
