;B[de];W[ip];B[fd];W[qn]C[As to the press of B9, White approaches the corner with W10, which servers as the ladder breaker.];B[nq];W[fc];B[gd]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.];W[ce];B[cf];W[cd];B[ed]C[B17 trying to obtain sente is really far-fetched and shouldn't be considered, the common move is to strengthen with the tiger's move at 'a'.]LB[dg:a]
;W[ec];B[en];W[cm];B[dl];W[cl];B[dk];W[ck];B[dj];W[lq]LB[df:a]C[Black's sequence from B19 to W26 is also questionable, although temporally preventing White from cutting at 'a', but it is too damaging to territory, Black's thickness can't be utilized.];B[qk];W[pe]LB[qj:a]C[B27: Black should pincer one line higher at 'a', if White still presses with the knight's move of W28, Black can push and cut, the fight will be to Black's advantage.]
;B[pd];W[od];B[oe];W[pf];B[ne];W[md]C[After this move, the game was closed for the first day.];B[me];W[ld];B[le];W[kd];B[pb];W[ke]C[Since Black's stone B27 is one line farther, White first turns up with W40, Black's potential on the left side is all gone.]
;B[kf];W[jf];B[kg]LB[jg:a][ph:b]C[B43 is a big losing move! Black certainly should play the double hane at 'a', this way Black can obtain sente and attack W28 and W32 by playing at 'b'.];W[re]C[White first strikes with W44, through W60, both sides are trying to run out.];B[rd];W[pc];B[qc];W[ob];B[qe];W[qf]
;B[rf];W[rg];B[se]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.];W[ph];B[pj];W[nh];B[mg];W[mi];B[mk];W[lj];B[kl]LB[lk:a]C[B61: Black perhaps should press at 'a', in the real game it easily leads to a fierce fight.]
;W[lk];B[ll];W[ml];B[nk];W[mm];B[jg]C[Because the turn of B67 can't be omitted, so the fight can't be good to Black.];W[pl]C[With the sequence from W68 to W80, White strengthens the lower side and sacrifices one stone W10, it is a satisfactory judgement.];B[ok];W[ri];B[nm];W[nn];B[om]
;W[on];B[mn];W[lm];B[pn];W[mo];B[pm];W[jj];B[og];W[oh];B[il];W[hj];B[ii]LB[ig:a][ij:b][jo:c]C[Because Black always needs to prevent White from playing double hane at 'a', so Black hopes to peep first with B85, after White connects at 'b', then start pounding White's thinness at 'c'.]
;W[km]C[W86 and W88: White is alert! White's big dragon is too long, and basically can't be killed.];B[jm];W[jn];B[in];W[jo];B[hl];W[jk];B[jl];W[hk];B[rj]LB[cq:a]C[In other words, B95 is an overplay, the normal move is to attach at 'a'. Black becomes thin in the center, Black's situation is already filled with grim possibilities.];W[fk]C[After W96, Black is hard to look after both sides.]
;B[fl];W[if];B[ig];W[gl];B[gm];W[gk];B[fi];W[gh];B[hg]C[Since there are two weak points: the hane at 105 and cut at 106, Black can't take care of both at the same time and has to concede defeat. Overall in this game, Hane Naoki's play is not very ideal.];W[fm];B[gn];W[el];B[em]
