;W[do];B[ck];W[kq];B[mq];W[qq];B[pq]LB[mo:a]TR[kq]C[Black's direct confrontation with B21 falls into White's trap. White seeks to attack three black stones on the left, so Black should jump out at 'a' to support the left side and threaten the marked white stone as well.];W[pp];B[oq];W[nq];B[nr];W[np]
;B[qo];W[mr];B[or];W[mp];B[qr];W[io]C[In the game, although Black gets the corner territory, but after White makes himself thick and grabs the key point with W32, White takes the initiative.];B[go];W[em];B[jp];W[kn];B[jn];W[jo];B[kp]

(;B[lp]LB[lq:a][lr:b][kr:c][hq:d]C[B41 is the correct move. If Black escapes at 'a', although Black can connect safely, but after W 41, B 'b', W 'c',  Black takes and White attaches at 'd', three black stones on the left will get captured (see var a).];W[lq];B[lo]
(;W[ln]LB[nn:a][lm:b][mm:c][mn:d][km:e]C[W44: White can seal off Black by playing at 'a', followed by B 44, W 'b', B 'c' and W 'd', but Black can wrap it up at 'e', perhaps Lee 9p doesn't think White's shape is good (see var a).];B[mo];W[on];B[mn];W[mm];B[nm];W[nn];B[om]
;W[pn];B[jq]LB[ip:a][hq:b]C[B53: Black needs to strengthen, otherwise W 'a', B 53, W 'b', Black hanes, White can double hane to kill Black.

Lee must think that the best Black can manage is to hang at 'a', followed by W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 'e', W 'f', B 'g', W 'h', B 'i' capturing two white stones (see var a). But Hane Naoki who is watching the game in the study room says, when B 'a' and W 'b', the push of B 'c' is a vulgar play, Black only needs to crosscut at 'e', White will collapse (see var b)! In fact W68 is unnecessary to be that greedy, if White simply blocks at 'd', White is good enough.]

(;B[mk];W[kl];B[ch]C[In this 30-second-per-move fast game, unfortunately Cho 9p fails to find this ingenious move, instead he plays B71 and prepares to fight a protracted war with White.];W[dl];B[cl];W[cm];B[bm];W[cg];B[bg];W[bf];B[cf];W[dg];B[be]C[The counter-attacks with B79 and B81 is certain. Although Black's five stones on the left is not completely alive, but Black can only play like this in order to have a chance of winning.]
;W[bh];B[af];W[ci];B[dc]LB[cd:a][cc:b]C[B85 is brilliant. The diagonal at 'a' or entering the corner at 'b' looks weak.];W[er];B[fr];W[cc];B[cd];W[ec];B[db];W[ed]
;B[eb];W[fb];B[fc];W[gb];B[cb];W[qn]LB[gd:a][qm:b]C[W98: White is alert! White is supposed to reinforce at 'a', but Lee Changho must have found Black's wonderful move of crosscutting at 'b', so he comes back quickly to prevent it.];B[gd];W[jc];B[ee];W[mc]C[W102: After White extends along the side, White is already favorable.]
;B[qf];W[bj];B[dk];W[ek]LB[di:a][ej:b]C[The hane at W106 is questionable, provoking B 'a', 'b' to pull his head out, this not only sends Black home free but also turns himself thin.];B[di];W[dh];B[ej];W[ei];B[fk];W[el];B[dj]
