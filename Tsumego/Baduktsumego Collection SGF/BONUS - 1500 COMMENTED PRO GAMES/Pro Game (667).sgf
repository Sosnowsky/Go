Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[In the preliminary round 5, Korean Baduk Association elected to broadcast the games of their two women players Cho HyeYeon and Park JiEun, their opponents are Kong Jie 7p and Yang Yi 5p of China respectively. This is the game between Cho HyeYeon and Kong Jie.
];W[dd];B[pq];W[oc]C[The sequence from B1 to W4 is very popular since the big series between Lee Changho and Choi Cheolhan.];B[cp]LB[md:a]C[B5: Black often will clamp at 'a', Kong Jie elects to play the old "Susaku Style", avoiding Korean familiar patterns.]

;B[cf];W[fd];B[cc];W[cd]TR[pe][nd]LB[ec:a]C[Black enters the corner with B21, White elects to play the block variation with W22, White's whole-game configuration is not good, because Black already takes the high points with the two marked stone, White is relatively difficult to cultivate the center, therefore for White to hang at 'a' taking territory is better.];B[dc];W[ec];B[eb];W[ed];B[gb];W[gc]
;B[fb];W[dj]TR[cf]LB[ep:a][dm:b]C[White pincers with W30, Kong Jie didn't pull out the marked stone immediately and elected to protect the corner first at 'a', after White strengthens with the two-space extension at 'b', then Black starts to move out, it is an interesting play.];B[hc];W[gd];B[ep];W[dm];B[ch];W[eh]C[Obviously Cho HyeYeon is "angry" at this kind of greedy play and wants to revenge.];B[cj]
;W[ck]C[W36 and W38 are fierce and relentless!];B[di]C[B39 seems very crude, waiting to get punished.];W[ei]C[Cho HyeYeon is not soft-hearted, White first presses Kong Jie's head with W40.];B[dk];W[ej];B[cl];W[bk];B[dl];W[bj]C[Next White fights back with W46, after this fight, White's three stones can't escape any more! However this should be calculated by her very earlier on, White wants to seal off Black by sacrificing, if playing this way, Black is certainly not good.];B[ci];W[cm]
;B[bl];W[bm];B[em]C[B51 is regarded as "a surprising move" by Korean media, this move also makes Cho HyeYeon's ideal play come to nothing.];W[en]LB[do:a]C[After the plan gets destroyed, White again plays the bad move of W52 to help Black reinforce, with this move White certainly should peep at 'a', this way the situation would be still very complicated.];B[el];W[dp]LB[do:a]C[White loses common senses with W54. If White hangs at 'a', Black's corner may get ruined.];B[do];W[dn];B[ak]
;W[dq];B[eo];W[fn];B[eq];W[fl];B[fm];W[gm];B[bi];W[ek];B[aj];W[hn];B[bo]C[Through B69, White incurs a big loss in territory, the seal on the outside still have cut and atari points, the game for White is as good as lost. So far, Kong Jie already wins the game for sure.

After this move, it is time for noon break.];W[og]C[The following sequence has no more surprise and it is all under Kong's control, as to high hands, it is also not a difficult situation to control.
