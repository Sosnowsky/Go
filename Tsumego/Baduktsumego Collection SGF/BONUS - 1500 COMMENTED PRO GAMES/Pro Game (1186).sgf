;W[nc];B[fq];W[cn];B[nq]LB[jp:a]C[The play of B7 and B9 is rarely seen, normally with B9 Black will continue to expand moyo at 'a'.];W[qf]C[The variation following W10 is also one joseki, but it seems the position of B5 is not right.];B[nd];W[md];B[ne];W[qc];B[oc];W[mc]
;B[qd];W[rd];B[me];W[rb];B[pb];W[le];B[lf];W[ke];B[rh]C[B25: Black plays on the second line to take away White's eye shape.];W[qe];B[kf];W[je];B[jf]
;W[ie];B[ph]LB[og:a][hg:b][fd:c][pg:d]C[But the jump of B31 is not good. Perhaps Black overlooks White's tactic at 'a'. With B31 Black should first exchange B 'b' and W 'c', then cap at 'd', this is clearly better than real game.

After this move, it is time for noon break.];W[og];B[nh];W[oe];B[pe]C[The push of B35 is crude move, but to obtain sente, Black has no other choice.];W[of];B[od];W[qg]C[After White doubles with W38, Black on the outside is very thin, sooner or later Black has to reinforce.]
;B[hg];W[fd];B[ip];W[pm];B[mg]C[B43 is the original move. Black itself has many defects and can't attack W42, but Black's tempo is surely slow.];W[qp];B[qo];W[po];B[rp];W[qq];B[pq]C[B47 and B49 are local good moves.];W[ro]C[Following W50, White first takes corner territory.]
;B[qn];W[rq];B[rn];W[sp];B[pn];W[jn]C[The play of W56 is Teacher Cho's style.];B[kp]C[If Black can't attack effectively, Black's territory will be inadequate.];W[hm];B[fm];W[kl];B[gk];W[hk]
;B[hj];W[ik]C[From W58 to W64, White has mitigated Black's attack, so far White's situation is very good.];B[cd];W[cc];B[ce];W[bc];B[kc];W[lc];B[gd];W[ge];B[fe];W[hd];B[ed]

;B[fp];W[ff];B[bn];W[el];B[dk];W[bo];B[gm]C[From B65 to B95, Black encloses side territory at maximum limit.];W[an]LB[hn:a][bp:b]C[W96: For White to extend at 'a' is very steady, but Black can clamp at 'b', White is not comfortable. In the game, Teacher Cho continues to grab territory, which shows his style and also forces opponent to capture the center to win.];B[hn];W[im]
;B[lm]C[Black's sequence following B99 is the strongest play.];W[ll];B[ml];W[mm];B[nm];W[mn];B[ln];W[nn];B[on];W[lo]LB[gj:a][mj:b]TR[hj]C[The hane of W108 is the losing move, not sure why White wants to give up stones in the middle, inexplicable! With W108 White should cut at 'a', White is sente at around 'b', B63 is already hard to escape, this way White can make life.]
