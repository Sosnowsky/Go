Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[This is the game 4 of 1st Kangwon-Land Cup ring contest between China and Korea, An Choyoung 9p takes White against Chen Yaoye 5p. 

In the first two game, Chen Yaoye all took White.];W[dc];B[dq];W[pp];B[ce]
;W[ed];B[oc];W[df];B[cf]LB[cg:a][dh:b][ch:c]C[B9: Black should consider to jump at 'a', next W 'b' and B 'c', this is relatively simple.];W[dg];B[cg];W[ch]C[White plays hane with W12 to seek variation, in Korean games, this variation appeared before. After W12, Black is a little difficult.];B[ci];W[bh]
;B[dh];W[bi];B[eh];W[de];B[cc];W[cb];B[cd];W[cj];B[bb];W[db];B[bg];W[ic]C[Through W26, White clearly obtains advantage. Black seems to "have been cut by a knife".];B[ej]
;W[cm];B[kc];W[ie];B[co];W[em];B[qn]LB[hi:a]C[The play of B33 is a little hasty, to escape at 'a' is relatively common.];W[ql];B[nq]C[Following B35, Black again elects to take territory, Black loses balance for the whole game.];W[pn];B[qq];W[pq]
;B[qp];W[po];B[rn];W[pr];B[qr];W[mp];B[ke]LB[hi:a]C[The direction of B45 is also questionable, to escape at 'a' is relatively normal.];W[fq];B[eo];W[fo]C[Through W48, White's outside influence looks splendid, White takes lead in the opening.];B[dl]C[Following B49, Black seeks breakthrough, Black's local play is not bad.]
;W[cl];B[en];W[fn];B[dm];W[dk];B[el];W[ek];B[fk]LB[fm:a][gm:b]C[But B57 is questionable, all previous effort has been wasted. Black should take at 'a', next W57 and B 'b', this way Black enters into the center, it would be still a game.];W[fj];B[fl]C[In the real game, the configuration of B57 are B59 is not the shape.]
;W[gj];B[hq];W[cn]C[When White hits with W62, Black is very painful.];B[fm];W[hn];B[bo];W[ep];B[dp];W[dn];B[do];W[gm];B[gk]C[Following B71, Black starts to counterattack, only playing this way, Black may have a chance to win.]
;W[hk];B[hj];W[gh];B[kp];W[mq];B[hl];W[ik];B[il];W[jk];B[jl];W[gl];B[em];W[kk]LB[ip:a]C[W84: For White to strengthen at 'a' is relatively steady, White will be favorable. In the real game, W84 is a strong move, it leads to a decisive fight.]
;B[hi];W[gi];B[jn];W[ip];B[iq];W[jp];B[jq];W[ko];B[jo];W[io]C[Through W94, it seems White is favorable in the fight.];B[kq];W[kn];B[km]

;B[nl];W[ok]C[White seals off with W112, Black already has no way to retreat.];B[fp]LB[go:a]C[Following B113, Black reduces liberties cleverly. It forms a ko-killing, but since it is sente-ko for White, Black has no single ko threat and can't avoid defeat. In fact, Black has a better move, with B113 Black should attach at 'a', this way Black will be much favorable in the ko fight. However, even if White loses the ko fight and plays two straight moves on the outside, White still would win the game.];W[gp];B[eq];W[gq];B[hp];W[go];B[fp];W[hr];B[gs]

The game 5 will take place on 2/10.])
