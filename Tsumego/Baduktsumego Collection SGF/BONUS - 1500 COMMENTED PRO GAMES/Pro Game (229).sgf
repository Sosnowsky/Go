;W[qi];B[cn];W[dk];B[en];W[fq];B[di]LB[bp:a][cq:b][bk:c]C[The clamp of B11 is positive, if Black makes the knight's move at 'a', followed by W 'b' and B 'c', although it is a joseki, but Black is a little dissatisfied.];W[fk];B[fo];W[bp];B[hp]
;W[hk];B[el];W[ek];B[fi]LB[ec:a]C[B17 and B19 is a positive attitude, however it may come to nothing in the end, Black can first consider to protect the corner at 'a'.];W[fc]C[W20: It is inevitable for White to tenuki and approach the corner.];B[dc];W[ic];B[kc];W[fe];B[jk]LB[dg:a]C[When White jumps with W24, Black has no state of mind to answer at around 'a'. The camp of B25 is a play of seeking tempo.]
;W[de]LB[gi:a]C[White tenukis and plays at 26, in fact for White to attach out at 'a' is not bad either.];B[gj];W[gk];B[ii];W[jl];B[kl];W[jm];B[hm];W[ik];B[jj];W[hn];B[in]
;W[im];B[gn]C[With the attack from B27 to B39, it seems Black is very happy.];W[ce]C[However, White takes sente to block at 40, it is also very substantial.];B[be];W[bf];B[bd];W[ll]LB[hi:a][hh:b][gh:c]C[The clamp of W44 is unreasonable! White should first strike out by crosscutting at 'a', followed by B 'b' and W 'c', this way Black is one step ahead, White most likely can separate Black and make himself thicker, then it is still not too late to come back and play the clamp of W44.];B[ed]C[The diagonal's extension of B45 is severe.]
;W[ee];B[fd];W[gd];B[ge];W[eh];B[ei];W[gc];B[bg]LB[gf:a]C[B53 is mild, if Black extends at 'a', White would be more difficult.];W[hf];B[km]C[Black is able to push with B55, overall the fight is still to Black's advantage.];W[jn]
;B[ho];W[hi]C[Now the attachment of W58 is already one step slow.];B[hh];W[gh];B[hj];W[gi];B[ij];W[cg];B[af];W[kk];B[he]LB[gg:a][fh:b][ie:c][hg:d]C[B67: If Black first ataris at 'a', Black is worried that White may connect at 'b', next if Black pushes at 67, White would not hane at 'c', instead White will play the atari at 'd', this way Black also takes some risk.
]
;W[ie];B[gg];W[gf];B[lm];W[ko];B[lk]C[After Black ataris with B73, Black's center becomes much thicker.];W[np];B[qk]C[The invasion of B75 is huge!];W[qf];B[rh]C[B77 is again an interrelated strong move, here Black can't allow White to settle easily.];W[qj]C[W78: White has no choice but to bump with W78, White becomes stable locally by sacrificing one stone of W76, Black gets to capture one white stone and has gained a lot of territory and can be satisfied.]
;B[qh];W[ph];B[pg];W[oh];B[qg];W[og];B[pf];W[pk];B[pl];W[ok];B[qp]C[The attachment of B89 is again a good move, White has no special strong resistance, if White plays the hane from outside and lets Black live in the corner, White's territory would be inadequate.];W[qq];B[po]
;W[op];B[rq];W[rp];B[qo];W[rr];B[pq]LB[qr:a][ro:b]C[B97 is reckless! After the exchange with W 'a', B 'b' becomes an absolute gote move.];W[qr];B[mn]LB[lp:a][ql:b]C[The exchange of B99 and W 'a' is also damaging, Black should simply connect at 'b'.]
;W[lp];B[rk]LB[ql:a][mc:b][nm:c][nn:d]C[But the last losing move is B101, Black still should connect at 'a', this way Black will threaten the well being of White's big group, White couldn't invade at 'b', Black is no bad. Here Black has overlooked White's good knight's move at 'c', if Black connects at 'a' instead, next Black can attach at 'd', White would have no follow-up maneuver.];W[nm];B[ml];W[ro];B[rj]C[When White crawls with W104, Black can only crossover at 105 and is very painful!];W[pm]C[In the game, the clamp of W106 makes Black very difficult.];B[ol]
;W[nl];B[om];W[nn];B[on];W[nk];B[fh]C[White has all connected together with the sequence of W106 to W112, so B113 can't be omitted any more.];W[mc]C[When White gets to invade with W114, the game is already slightly favorable to White.];B[ld];W[md];B[lf];W[od];B[ob]
