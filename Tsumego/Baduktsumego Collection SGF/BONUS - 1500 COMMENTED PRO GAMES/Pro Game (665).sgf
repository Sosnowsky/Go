;B[fe];W[gc];B[hd];W[hc];B[id];W[ic];B[jd];W[kc];B[dk];W[cm]C[The opening up to W16 is common.];B[fh]C[B17 is not a bad feeling.];W[ej]
;B[ek];W[gi]C[The play of W18 and W20 is very strong and unyielding, initiating a fierce fight.];B[dm]C[B21 is a good move.];W[dn];B[cl];W[em];B[bm];W[dl];B[cn];W[dm];B[bk];W[co]
;B[bn]C[Through B31, in this local fight, Black scores, during the process, with W22, White perhaps can also retreat at 27, but that is not Choi Cheolhan's style.];W[ee]C[White's sequence following W32 separating Black is inevitable, otherwise White has no other possible play in this area.];B[ef];W[cj];B[ck];W[df];B[ed];W[de];B[dd];W[fd];B[ec];W[cd]
;B[cc];W[bd];B[db]C[B45 simply taking is a calm and good move.];W[cf];B[bo]C[Black obtains sente and grabs the big point with B47, Black still takes the initiative.];W[ge];B[cq];W[dq];B[cp];W[kd];B[gq];W[gm]
;B[do];W[eo];B[jp]C[Through B57, I think Black is favorable.];W[gk];B[go]C[B59 continues to aim at White's thinness.];W[lq]LB[gn:a]C[The counterattack of W60 is inevitable, if White simply plays at 'a', it equals to "wait to die", in the game if Black can't find any severe tactic on the left-side White, the situation will be still very chaotic.];B[fl];W[gn];B[gl];W[hl];B[lo]
;W[np];B[hm]C[The cut of B67 is also inevitable, here I feel Black is already better to play.];W[ho];B[im];W[gp];B[hq];W[fq];B[fr]LB[oo:a]C[B73 is bad, Black should attack with the knight's move at 'a'.];W[hp]C[After White counterattacks with W74, Black has no good answer.];B[eq];W[iq]
;B[ip];W[fp];B[dr];W[ep];B[er];W[ir];B[hr];W[fm]C[Through W84, Black sells out all the aji here and gains very little.];B[oo]C[When Black attacks with B85 now, ...];W[jq];B[kp];W[hs]
;B[gr];W[oq]C[..., since White on the left side already makes life, White can simply live locally with the sequence following W90.];B[pp];W[pr];B[qr];W[or];B[no];W[oc]C[White gets to grab the big point with W96 in sente, the situation seems to have been turned around.];B[pj];W[pe];B[qf];W[pi]C[W100 is a good and alert move.]

;W[qh];B[oi];W[ph]C[Through W116, White successfully destroys Black's territory on the right side, the situation has been completely turned around.];B[rg];W[oh]LB[rh:a]C[W118 is a bad move, this move shows Korean players' tenacious style, since when Black hanes at the head, White can only turn with W126 and clearly incurs loss. With W118, White can only block at 'a', White is already favorable in the game.];B[rh];W[ri];B[nh];W[rn];B[ro];W[rp]
;B[qo];W[og];B[mi];W[lh];B[mg];W[ng];B[mh];W[ne]C[Through W132, I feel the game is close and slightly to Black's favor.];B[qb]LB[pc:a][ob:b][pb:c][od:d]C[B133: If Black loses this game, B133 is the losing move, Black certainly should make the diagonal extension at 'a', if White descends at 'b', Black already can take tenuki and play in the middle; When B 'a', if W 'c', then B 'd', this makes a big difference for the endgame.]
;W[jh];B[ki];W[lg];B[mf];W[pc]C[After White peeps with B138, Black is already not favorable in the game.];B[qc];W[le];B[ij];W[ii];B[ji];W[hi];B[dj];W[ei]
;B[hk]LB[mq:a][mr:b][mp:c][kq:d]C[B147: Black should first attach at 'a', followed by W 'b', B 'c' and W 'd', however even like this, Black would be still falling behind.];W[jj]C[W148 is a clever endgame.];B[kj]LB[ik:a]C[After B149, the double atari at 'a' becomes effective, if Black plays endgame like this, he probably will incur a big loss in the end.];W[lp];B[jo];W[fb];B[bc]
