Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.]RE[B+R];B[pd];W[dd];B[qp];W[dp];B[oq];W[qj]C[The opening proceeds very fast.]
;B[cj];W[nc];B[qf];W[qm]C[In the past, whenever Lee Changho advanced to the final sixteen or eight, he most likely will take the champion. But now things are different. Piao Wenyao is young strong players in Chinese Go arena.];B[fc];W[hc]C[Recently, Lee Changho 9p's state is not good and he lost five consecutive important games. Only in the game 6, he won luckily by half point.];B[cm];W[fq];B[fe]C[B15: After thinking for a short while, Lee Changho still elects to jump.];W[cf]C[White selects the simplest play. Piao Wenyao 5p is very calm and solid. With one-space jump, Lee Changho seeks to fight.];B[db]
;W[cc];B[oc]C[B19 is strong move, Black wants to play in both upper-left and upper-right corner, then invade in the middle.];W[nd];B[jc]C[Lee Changho 9p likes to fight recently. Now Black's attack is very powerful.];W[he];B[je];W[hg]C[White jumps steadily, but it seems White gains nothing.];B[hb];W[pe]C[Piao Wenyao's play at the top is a little loose, but he perhaps aims at the fight in the upper-right corner.];B[qe];W[qc]C[White invades, how Black to answer?]
;B[oe]C[B29 is unexpected. In terms of process, Black is relatively easy to play.];W[ob];B[pb];W[pc];B[od];W[qb];B[nb];W[pa];B[mb]C[Black's situation is not bad if there is no aji left at the top.];W[kd];B[ic]C[After the peep of W38, Black elects to bump with B39, White appears a little careless.];W[ne]C[White looks very confident and didn't hesitate to play.]
;B[nf];W[ld]C[White still makes extension simply. As to W42, Lee Changho is pondering. Here there will be a complicated fight, must be careful. However, it seems there is no special tactic.];B[og]C[Lee Changho wants to fight by sacrificing.];W[lb]C[W44: White captures two stones.];B[lf];W[kb]C[W46: White gains 20 points and should be satisfied.];B[ch];W[cb]C[W48: White is leading in territory.];B[fg]C[B49 is the most common and steady move. It seems Lee Changho 9p thinks his situation is not bad. This game looks a very long one. Whether White to sacrifice three stones in the center or stir a fight is a difficult question.];W[hi]C[W50: The key for this game is how much profit Black can get by attacking.]
;B[ik]C[B51 is the vital point for attacking.];W[fh];B[eh];W[gg];B[ef]C[B55: After a long meditation, Lee Changho still elects to hang.];W[fi]C[W56 is not good.];B[hq]C[B57: Lee Changho grabs the biggest point on the board. Since White in the center is still not alive, White will be exploited in the lower right corner.];W[dg];B[eg];W[co]C[W60 is the biggest point for territory on the board.];B[be]C[B61 is beautiful tesuji.]
;W[ce];B[bf];W[eb]C[W64 is the right move.];B[bd]C[B65 is very big.];W[fb];B[hd]C[B67: Black becomes thicker and thicker by attacking. Piao Wenyao 5p is pondering.

After this move, it is time for noon break.];W[cg];B[bg];W[dh];B[di];W[ei]C[W72: After noon break, Piao 5p separates Black resolutely.]
;B[gc];W[bc]C[W74 is a thick move and also indirectly strengthens the lonely stones in the center.];B[om]C[B75, B51 and B57 are indeed beautiful moves, now White is a little painful although having more territory. I feel, early on Piao Wenyao should handle three stones lightly in the center.];W[ro]C[W76: White seeks territory at maximum limit.];B[rp]C[B77: Now what White needs to do are, destroy Black's moyo at the bottom, protect right-side territory. The most important is, White in the center is still not alive completely. How White to achieve all three goals?];W[dl]C[W78 is the vital point for the shape.];B[bm]C[B79 is very steady, and there appears some aji in the lower left corner.];W[qo];B[po];W[pn]C[W82 looks like a crude move.]
;B[on];W[pp];B[oo]C[B85: Black becomes even thicker.];W[pq];B[qq];W[pr];B[qr]C[B89: Now White's aji on the right side is still very bad.];W[ri]C[W90: Piao Wenyao 5p elects to reinforce.

Now let's judge the situation. White: 8 points in the upper left corner, 16 points in the upper right corner, 10 points in the lower left corner, total 42 points. Black: 11 points on the left, about 10 points at the top. So, for Black to enclose about 30 points at the bottom will be good enough.];B[ho]C[B91: Lee Changho elects to expand at maximum limit.];W[im]C[W92: Since White in the center is still not safe, White dares not invade deeply. The first feeling of Black's next move is to attach from outside.];B[jn]C[B93 is very steady. Originally White has some hidden tactics, so White didn't invade too aggressively.]
;W[jm];B[kn];W[or];B[ql];W[rl];B[nq];W[rr];B[rs];W[nr]C[W102: Now Black can enclose 40-point territory at the bottom.];B[mr];W[km]C[W104: Now Black is favorable, but the difference is very small, must be very careful.];B[lm]
;W[ll];B[op]C[B107 is Lee Changho first-class good move, it eliminates aji completely. Now White's hane-and-connect in the first line on the right side is not sente anymore, White needs to work hard.];W[hr];B[gr];W[gq];B[ir];W[hp];B[iq];W[ln];B[mm]C[B115: White's order in this area is very clever. However if there is no loop hole, it is damaging to territory, since White's lower-left corner is damaged.];W[ip];B[jp]
;W[io];B[in];W[hn];B[kq];W[dk]C[W122: Is this the right move?];B[dj]C[B123 looks crude but is very calm.];W[ej];B[ck];W[jj]C[W126: White first encloses the center. Since the aji in the lower left corner is not good, White has no other choices.];B[dm]C[B127: White is very painful to answer.
];W[go]C[W128: White simply takes cleanly.]
;B[fm];W[bn];B[rm];W[qk];B[pm];W[qn]C[W134: Black eliminates White's hane-and-connect aji.];B[pl];W[sm];B[so];W[rn];B[sp];W[sn]C[W140: Lee Changho 9p now enters into overtime.]
;B[fr];W[er];B[eq]C[B143 is good order.];W[fs];B[hs];W[dq];B[fk];W[ek];B[hl];W[hm];B[fl]C[B151 again is indeed good order.];W[bh]
;B[ci];W[am]C[W154 is good timing.];B[cn]C[B155 is good move.];W[bo];B[al];W[bl];B[an];W[cl];B[bk];W[ao];B[am];W[en]
;B[em];W[jb]C[W166 is a very practical endgame.];B[ec];W[dc];B[jg]C[B169: The situation now is very close.];W[jh];B[kh];W[jd];B[id]C[B173: Black is a little favorable.];W[ig]C[W174: Piao Wenyao 5p catches up slowly, making Lee Changho painful.];B[ji]
;W[jf];B[ih]C[B177: Both sides don't want to retreat.];W[ie];B[ge];W[kf]C[W180: It is perhaps half-point game.];B[fn];W[fo];B[eo];W[ep];B[lg];W[me]C[W186 is counter-sente.];B[kc]
;W[lc];B[es];W[ds];B[qd];W[nh];B[rc];W[rb];B[rd];W[mf];B[kj];W[rg];B[rf];W[ng]
;B[jk];W[of];B[pg];W[li];B[ij];W[sc];B[sd];W[sb];B[mk];W[lj];B[lk];W[kl];B[qh]
;W[rh];B[lh];W[nj];B[oa];W[na];B[nk];W[ad];B[ae];W[ac]C[W222: Black is ahead 8-9 points on the board.];B[ga];W[gb];B[ib];W[hj]
