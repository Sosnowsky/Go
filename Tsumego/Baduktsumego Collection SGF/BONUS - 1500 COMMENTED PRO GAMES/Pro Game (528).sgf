;B[fo];W[dr];B[lm];W[pb];B[qc];W[mc];B[er]LB[kk:a][hq:b][eq:c][dq:d][ip:e]C[B25: For Black to cap at 'a' is also a good point, if White invades at 'b', then B 'c', W 'd' and B 'e', comparing to the real game, White is a little difficult to make life.];W[hq]
;B[io]LB[ip:a]C[B27: For Black to double up at 'a' is still better.];W[kq];B[ir];W[mo];B[nl]LB[nm:a]C[The shape of B31 is not right, Black should make the diagonal at 'a', White would be more difficult to dodge itself.];W[nq];B[lr];W[kr];B[mq]C[The play of B33 and B35 seems overly strong and unyielding. Black's liberty is too tight, the aji is not good, to attack from outside by playing the diagonal at 'a' is better.]LB[or:a]
;W[nr];B[mp];W[np];B[lp];W[mr];B[lq];W[qr]LB[po:a][oo:b]C[W42 is a good move! If White directly makes the diagonal at 'a', Black can push at 'b', White is no good.];B[pr];W[po];B[rm];W[rn]
;B[qm]LB[oo:a][pp:b][op:c][qq:d][oq:e][rp:f]C[B47: Black still should push at 'a', forming an exchange with White is better with the sequence of W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B ''e, W 'f' and B47, this way Black is a little better than the real game.];W[oo];B[nn];W[sm];B[rl];W[rp]LB[kp:a][ko:b]C[With the attachment of W52, it forms a ko fight, because White has local ko threats at 'a' and 'b', Black can't win the ko.]

;W[ko];B[ls];W[sq];B[lc];W[ss];B[md]C[Through B71, an exchange has resulted, White is a little favorable.];W[pi];B[ph];W[oh];B[oi];W[ni];B[pj];W[oj]
;B[pi];W[ld]LB[in:a]C[The purpose of the cut with W80 is to correlate with White's several stones on the right side, then White attaches out at 'a', it is very big.];B[kc];W[le];B[nd];W[jd];B[mb];W[in];B[hn];W[jn]LB[hm:a]C[W88: White can also consider to play the double-hane at 'a', although Black can capture four white stones by playing at 88, but White gets to turn his body.]
;B[kl];W[hm];B[ho];W[il];B[kj];W[li]LB[rk:a][mn:b]C[W94: White should first block at 'a', because Black has the defect of the push at 'b', Black already can't block crossover in the first line, this way White is thicker than the real game, also Black has no way to back down, it will make a big difference in thinness and thickness.];B[ki];W[lg];B[em];W[hj];B[kh]
;W[nc];B[oc]LB[nb:a]TR[md][nd]C[B101: Black should always play atari at 'a', this way the marked two stones are relatively light, White would be still worried about Black's push and cut.];W[nb];B[ob];W[jf]LB[rk:a]C[W104: White still should block at 'a'.];B[hh];W[iq];B[hr]
;W[fj];B[cm];W[bm];B[cl];W[bl];B[dn]LB[cj:a]C[B113 is the losing cause of this game! With B113 Black should jump to 'a', this way the situation would be still very complicated.];W[ck]C[The hane of W114 is not only big and White's big group also already connects, however Black still doesn't completely capture White's corner.];B[co];W[bn];B[do];W[bo]
;B[cp];W[gr]LB[jr:a]C[W120 is a mistake, White should bump at 'a'. After B 'a', Black is left with the tactic of crossing over.];B[jr];W[jq];B[gq];W[js];B[gs];W[no]LB[mn:a]C[The exchange of W126 and B 'a' also should be reserved.];B[mn];W[ce]
;B[cc]LB[fh:a]C[B129 entering the corner is the last losing move, jumping to 'a' is imperative.];W[ih]C[The attachment of W130 is severe, Black simply doesn't have time to live the corner.];B[ig];W[jg];B[ii];W[jh];B[hi];W[ji];B[ik];W[jk];B[jj]
;W[ij];B[hk];W[gj];B[gl];W[kk]LB[km:a]C[W144: If White ataris at 'a', the ko will be much lighter.];B[lk];W[jl];B[lj];W[km];B[ll];W[ln];B[kn]
;W[fl];B[gm]C[B153: Black should eliminate the ko!];W[ln];B[dk];W[kn];B[cj];W[bk];B[di];W[fh];B[mj]LB[rk:a]C[Although Black strengthens with one move B161, but in fact if White blocks at 'a', Black itself is very tight in liberties, Black still can't capture White's several stones, Black incurs a big loss. ];W[dl]
