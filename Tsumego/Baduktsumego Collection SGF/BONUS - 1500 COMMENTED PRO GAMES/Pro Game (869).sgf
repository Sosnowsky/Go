Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[pd]C[After obtaining the Samsung champion, Luo Xihe continues to be in a good state, he advanced to the quarter final after winning two straight games.];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[qk];W[qo]C[The direct corner-approach of W6 is rarely seen, generally speaking, if Black already has B5, White is not good to play this way, however now Luo Xihe is very strong and brave, he dares play any move and he can win!]
;B[qp];W[op];B[pp];W[oo];B[po];W[on];B[pn]C[Through B13, Black has nothing to complain.];W[fq];B[kp];W[kn];B[ln];W[lm];B[mn]
;W[ko];B[lp];W[nl];B[km]LB[om:a][nm:b][lo:c][nn:d]C[B23: Black should play hane at 'a', next W 'b' and B 'c', if White connects at 'd', then Black can cut at 23, this is clearly better than the real game.];W[ll];B[jm];W[in];B[nm];W[om]
;B[lo]C[The play from B23 to B29 is very crude, W16 and W20 are relatively light, Black pays a big price to capture these two stones, Black's loss outweighs its gain.];W[pk]C[Following W30, White handles very well.];B[pj];W[ql];B[ok];W[ol];B[jn];W[oq];B[io];W[qn];B[pr];W[rk]
;B[pl];W[pm];B[rj];W[nk];B[oj];W[rl]C[Through W46, White instead takes advantage in this local variation.];B[qf];W[mi]LB[jc:a]C[W48 is a little slow, White should make extension at 'a'.];B[cf]LB[bp:a]C[B49 appears common, but at this situation, Black perhaps should first play at 'a' to fully utilize Black's thickness after capturing two stones.]
;W[ce]LB[cn:a]C[W50 again is a good move which doesn't conform to conventional pattern, this makes sure that Black can't take tenuki and White gets to protect the corner at 'a'.];B[df];W[fd];B[cj];W[cn];B[kc];W[ho];B[hn]C[The exchange of W56 and B57 echoes White's corner.];W[or];B[ro];W[rn]
;B[rq];W[nc];B[pc];W[pg];B[qg];W[me];B[ke];W[ch]C[The invasion of W68 is positive.];B[bf]LB[dh:a]C[The descent of B69 is the right move, if Black presses at 'a', White's hane at 69 is sente, Black can't tolerate.];W[ci];B[dj]
;W[eg];B[ef];W[ei];B[fg]LB[cc:a][dc:b][cd:c][gf:d][fh:e][fk:f][be:g]C[B75: Black should first strike at 'a' to probe White. If White still blocks at 'b', Black can directly squeeze at 'c' and doesn't need to exchange, B75, B 'd' and W 'e' and E 'f'; If White blocks at 'g', Black can hang out with B75 and B 'd', White can only strengthen at 'b' and fly out at 'f', this variation is better than the real game.];W[fh];B[gf];W[fk]
;B[cc];W[dc];B[cd];W[cb];B[bb];W[db];B[de];W[hc]C[After White flies with W86, White's situation is favorable.];B[bm];W[cm];B[cl];W[bk];B[bj]
;W[bl];B[ag];W[oh];B[qh];W[so];B[rp];W[jb];B[jc];W[ib];B[cq]C[B101 taking the corner is the last game-deciding place, here White's play is very brilliant.];W[er];B[el];W[hg]

Finally Black is too painful to find ko any threats, Luo Xihe is really "the king of ko".]
