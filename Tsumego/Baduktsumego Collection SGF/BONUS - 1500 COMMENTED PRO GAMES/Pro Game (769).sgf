;W[od];B[oc];W[nc];B[pc];W[dg];B[nd];W[de]C[The opening up to W12 is often seen nowadays.];B[mc];W[qj]LB[cf:a][pj:b][nq:c]C[The split of W14 seems inevitable, in fact that's not the case. Since White already presses with W12, with W14 White wants to hang at 'a', next B 'b' and W 'c'.]
;B[ql];W[qg];B[cd];W[dd]C[Black pulls out following B17, it seems Black takes the initiative everywhere.];B[cg];W[cf];B[bf];W[df];B[bg]LB[ch:a][bh:b]C[The connection of B23 is a novel move, in the past Black will extend at 'a' or hang at 'b'.];W[bc]
;B[cj];W[jc];B[cm];W[fq];B[nq];W[qp]LB[hq:a][ph:b][jp:c][qo:d][co:e]C[W30 living corner is too early, leaving two big points the extension at 'a' and the strike at 'b', White can't be satisfied. White should make extension at 'c', if Black makes the diagonal at 'd', White can make the diagonal at 'e', this way Black's strike at 'b' will be meaningless.

;W[qi];B[pk];W[oh];B[ni];W[io]C[The reduction of W50 is inevitable.];B[ho]LB[jp:a]C[B51: Black completely doesn't have the mindset to protect at 'a'.];W[ip];B[hp];W[in];B[hn];W[im]
;B[jr]LB[er:a]C[However, before flying over with B57, Black wants to make something happen in White's corner, for example, strike at 'a'. Since White's corner is very thin, Black should take this chance.];W[hm];B[id];W[ic];B[gd];W[ie];B[he];W[je];B[hg];W[gb]C[Through W66, both sides are very steady.];B[gm]
;W[gl];B[hl]C[Starting from W68 and B69, the situation suddenly becomes intense, this is perhaps related to situation judgment.];W[jq];B[kq];W[iq]C[W70 and W72 seem a little crude but they are very practical, White wants to make eyes locally.];B[ir];W[kp];B[hk];W[lq];B[kr];W[fm];B[gn]
;W[gr];B[hr];W[jk]C[Through W82, it seems the cut of B69 is not successful.];B[fj];W[dl];B[dm];W[fl]C[W86 is strong and unyielding.];B[ij]LB[en:a][ej:b]C[B87: If Black separates White at 'a', Black is worried White may attach at 'b'.];W[cl]C[Following W88, White makes the lower left corner into real territory, White's profit is not small.]

;W[bn]LB[qf:a][re:b][nh:c]C[W102 is an overplay, White perhaps thinks it is sente. White should press at 'a', next B 'b' and W 'c'.];B[og];W[ne];B[md];W[nh];B[ng];W[mh];B[pg];W[qf];B[re]

With W156, for White to block at 157 is just the right endgame. With W160, White also shouldn't exchange W160 and B161, later on, when Black plays atari at 'a', White connects at 'b', but after White descends at 'c', White can't connect any more, since B 'd' can make seki.]
