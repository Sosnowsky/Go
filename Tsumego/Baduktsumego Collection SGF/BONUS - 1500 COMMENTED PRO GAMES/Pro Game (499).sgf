(;SZ[19]EV[8th LG Cup final game 2]DT[2004-03-11]PC[Korea]KM[6.5]PB[Lee Changho]BR[9p]PW[Mok Jinseok]WR[7p]RE[B+R]C[Copyright by gogameworld.com and weiqi.tom.com.];B[qd]C[Black is Lee Chang ho 9P of Korea];W[dc]C[White is Mok Jin seok 7P of Korea];B[dq]C[In the game 1, Mok 7p took Black and won by 3.5 points, this is game 2.];W[pp]
;B[ce]C[Lee Changho is playing very fast, it seems he is well-prepared, as to the "facing small-points" of W2 and B3, in general, who approaches first will be favored.];W[dn]C[The two-space high approach of W6 is to ease up Black's pincer attack.];B[cp]LB[cl:a][fp:b][co:c]C[B7 is rarely seen, if not considering the surrounding configuration, the common play is B 'a', W 'b' and B 'c'.];W[dh];B[fe];W[fc];B[ed];W[ec];B[cj]
;W[fh];B[ej];W[cg];B[he]C[B17 is a simple and clear play.];W[gf];B[ge];W[de];B[dd];W[cd]C[White initiates a fight.];B[gc];W[ee];B[fd]
;W[cc]C[Through W26, White gains a big territory in the upper left.];B[fn];W[ic];B[gb];W[lc];B[oc]LB[nc:a]C[B31: For Black to press White one step further at 'a' would be more powerful, but the corner appears relatively weak.];W[jd];B[jf];W[eg];B[hf];W[lf]LB[dk:a]C[W36: White perhaps should first take action in the lower left, for example playing at 'a'.]
;B[dl]C[Black turns back to grab the good point with B37, Song TaeKon 6p, who is watching the game, thinks the game enters into Lee Changho's pace. From the whole board's configuration, Black is taking the lead.];W[jq];B[gq]C[After B39, Black encloses a sure territory of about 40+ points in the lower left.];W[qn];B[bh];W[bg];B[or]C[B43 is a both offensive and defensive play.];W[oq];B[pr];W[nr];B[nq];W[mq]
;B[np];W[mr];B[qp];W[qq];B[pq];W[rp];B[op];W[qo];B[mp]C[Black plays very fast in this area, in other words, it shows Black's situation is not bad.];W[lp]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.];B[lo];W[kp]
;B[qr]LB[rr:a][nm:b][lm:c][po:d][qp:e][pn:f]C[B61 is an asking move before sticking the head out to the center, if White blocks at 'a', then B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e' and B 'f', Black is very easy to make one eye in the center, B61 is very big and also threatens White's safety (see var a).]
(;W[hd];B[gd];W[rr];B[po];W[pn];B[qp]C[Black elects to play the ko directly.];W[rq];B[nn];W[ho];B[go];W[qh];B[qf]C[The one-space extension of B73 looks small but big in reality.]
;W[hn]C[W74 is a surprising move. Now Black is very thick on the whole board, White has many weak points on the upper and left side, and they may come under Black's attack.];B[gl];W[nb];B[nc];W[ob];B[pb];W[pc];B[pd];W[qb];B[qc];W[pa];B[pp];W[mc]
;B[rb];W[pj];B[ib];W[jb];B[hr]LB[ir:a]C[B91 is the biggest endgame on the board, B91 shows Lee Changho's calmness, general thinking is to make the knight's move at 'a'.];W[hp];B[ir];W[jr];B[kn]
(;W[rg]LB[ol:a][pk:b][rh:c][ci:d][jo:e]C[W96: If White continues to answer in the center, then B 'a', W 'b', B96, W 'c' and B 'd', White would be sure to lose the game (see var a). However after W96 in the game, Black is left with a good diagonal extension at 'e'.];B[jo];W[ko];B[jm];W[hl]LB[iq:a][jp:b][ip:c][io:d][jn:e][kr:f][hk:g]C[After W100, if B 'a', W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 'e' and W 'f' (can't be omitted) and B 'g', White is painful (see var a).]

(;B[hk];W[ln];B[mo];W[il];B[lm];W[gk]LB[iq:a][jp:b][ip:c][kr:d][hj:e]C[After W106, if B 'a', W 'b', B 'c', W 'd' and B 'e', White is not easy to make life.];B[gj];W[fk]

;W[ff];B[jg];W[jp];B[em];W[gp];B[fp];W[hg];B[je];W[pc]C[This ko is very big, if White loses this ko fight, White's group at the top would be still not alive.];B[iq];W[ip];B[pb];W[fq]
;B[fr];W[pc];B[kr];W[ls];B[pb]C[This ko is huge for both sides, perhaps it most likely will dedicate the outcome of this game.];W[eq];B[ep];W[gn];B[fo];W[in];B[jn];W[im];B[qa]
;W[bi];B[bj];W[hq];B[gr];W[ci];B[ai];W[fb]C[So far, Lee Changho still has one hour free time and Mok Jinseok is already in overtime, Black has about 65 points on the board and White 57 points, Black is leading about 8-9 points on the board, the important thing is that now it's Black's turn to play.];B[ke];W[le];B[kd];W[ia];B[ha];W[hb]
