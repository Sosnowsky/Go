Source: Sports Weekly,
Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[In my memory, it is very rare to see that Lee Changho loses so quickly as in this game. Recently in Lee Changho's games, there were many miscalculation, in the past you almost can't find any defect in his games.];W[dd];B[pq];W[oc];B[kd]
;W[mc];B[pf];W[qb]C[W6 and W8 are very steady moves, as to this, Black also can be satisfied.];B[dp];W[po]LB[qk:a]C[W10: For White to split at 'a' is common.];B[qm]C[B11: Of course, Black will pincer.];W[qh]C[W10 and W12: White's thinking is inconsistent, since White's strength of W6 and W8 lies inside, B5 and B7 takes outside influence, White is a little far-fetched to initiate a fight here.];B[qo]C[B13 is a steady move.];W[pn]LB[qk:a]C[W14: If White plays at 'a', then the exchange of W10 and B13 is damaging to White. Therefore with W14 White seeks variation, but White's playing direction is clearly not good.]
;B[qn];W[pp];B[qp];W[oq];B[oh]C[The cap of B19 is severe.];W[qk]C[W20 hits on the iron head and White is painful.];B[nd];W[nc];B[rg]LB[oi:a]C[B23 is a careless move, Black may have overlooked Lee Changho's good move at 'a', Black instantly doesn't have any answer.];W[oi];B[pm]LB[ni:a][nj:b]C[B25: If Black plays at 'a', White will play double-hane at 'b' and aim to press at 25, Black can't move at all.

In the real game, Black has no other choice but to play B25.]
;W[ph];B[og];W[ni]C[With W26 and W28, White sticks his head out smoothly, Black incurs loss. If seeing this variation earlier, with B23, Black certainly would directly play at 25.];B[rh];W[ri];B[mh];W[lj];B[le]C[B31 and B33 to defend is necessary, otherwise White will make the knight's move at 33, Black's thickness will become lonely and come under attack.];W[fq]LB[pr:a][np:b]C[The selection of W34 is inexplicable: to play at 'a' isn't clearly bigger? If I were White, I certainly will play atari at 'a' then hang at 'b', this is the vital point and related to White's base.];B[cn]
;W[dr];B[pr];W[cq];B[ck];W[no];B[kq];W[ko];B[hq]LB[nm:a]C[B41 and B43 are also weird, the value at the bottom is not big, Black should stick head out at 'a', aiming to attack White's big dragon, this more likes Choi Cheolhan's style.];W[om]C[W42 and W44 are good and strong moves!];B[ol];W[pl]
;B[nm];W[on];B[ok]LB[nl:a][ll:b]C[B49: Not sure whether Black wants to sacrifice, because if White cuts at 'a', Black's two stones have no way to live; However if Black connects at 'a', White will jump to 'b', Black is very dangerous.];W[nl]C[Through W50, White's two weak groups have connected together.];B[nq];W[nk]LB[fc:a]C[W52 reinforcing himself is Lee Changho's top-rated thick play, but  I always feel it is slow. I would grab the super-big point at 'a'.];B[op];W[np];B[fc]
;W[cf];B[db];W[ci];B[cp];W[cc];B[lb];W[rc];B[dq];W[br];B[bq];W[cr];B[fe]C[After B67, the situation is close, most people thick they will fight big in the endgame. However, afterwards Lee Changho makes miscalculation in a careless counterattack, White's situation takes a bad turn very quickly.];W[hf]
;B[hd];W[ff];B[ee];W[ef];B[de];W[ce];B[bi]C[B75 is an asking move.];W[bj]LB[bh:a]C[Although Black will take advantage anyway no matter how White to answer, but with W76 White can only tolerate at 'a'.];B[cj];W[bk];B[bh]
;W[cl];B[dl];W[cm];B[dm];W[bn];B[bl];W[bm];B[al]C[Lee Changho may have overlooked B85 and B87 these two good moves, Lee Changho suddenly loses the game.];W[dk];B[dj];W[am];B[bo];W[ak]
;B[dg];W[dh];B[cg];W[df];B[eh];W[ej];B[ek];W[di];B[dk];W[ei];B[eg];W[gh];B[fk]C[After B105, White at most can make a multi-stage ko in the capturing race, to concede defeat is reasonable. 

The decisive game 5 will take place on 3/2.]
