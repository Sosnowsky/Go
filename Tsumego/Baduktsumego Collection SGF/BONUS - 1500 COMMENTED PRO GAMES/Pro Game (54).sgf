;B[lp];W[ck];B[cf];W[ce]LB[ch:a]C[W10: Xie He thinks, for White to play one-space pincer at 'a' is also possible, if so, Black generally will take tenuki.
];B[df];W[fc];B[ep];W[eq];B[fp];W[gq];B[ej]C[B13, B15 and B17 are very positive, it seems Hu Yaoyu wants to defeat his opponent by power today.]
;W[ci];B[eh];W[ek];B[fk];W[dj];B[el]LB[fj:a]C[B23: If Black simply connects at 'a', White can jump out, Black's shape as a whole is not right, Yu Bin commented. With B17 for Black to jump to 18 is more steady.];W[ei];B[dk];W[fj];B[fq];W[fr];B[gr]
;W[hr];B[fi];W[ek];B[er];W[fh];B[fs];W[gi]C[Through W36, it leads to an astonishing exchange. After deep analysis by pros, White loses one-and-half move in the lower right corner, and Black loses one move, the first feeling is that Black didn't incur loss in this exchange. Yu Bin thinks, B9 and B11 can't be captured, Black has to escape next, otherwise White's territory is huge, now luckily Black obtains sente.];B[fe];W[hd]LB[gd:a][he:b]C[W38 is good move, Yu Bin commented, for White to make diagonal at 'a' is slow and White also takes some risk if capping at 'b'.];B[he]
;W[ie];B[cc]C[Yu Bin thinks, the order of B39 and B41 is wrong. Black should first enter the corner with B41 to probe White. In the real game, it equals to tell opponent to block with W42.];W[dc];B[be];W[cd]C[With W42 if White plays at 44, after crosscutting, Black can capture W2, W10 and W44, so White can only play this way.];B[gd]LB[bg:a]C[B45 is questionable, Yu Bin thinks, Black should first hang at 'a', asking opponent whether to allow living locally. Now no matter how to play at top, Black gives away real territory, Black's loss is very big, and after outside shape is settled, Black can no longer hang at 'a' any more.];W[gc];B[id];W[hc];B[if];W[je]
;B[fg];W[gg];B[gf];W[eg];B[ef];W[ff];B[bd];W[bc];B[fg]LB[hf:a]C[B59 is good move, said Yu Bin, better than playing at 'a' directly. ];W[hg];B[hf];W[ff]
;B[ed];W[fd];B[fg]C[Through B65, the game was closed for noon break. Black is still passive in the game, but Black's strategy of fighting following B37 appears to be effective. There will be a fierce fight in the afternoon.];W[po];B[pp];W[op];B[oo];W[mp];B[on];W[lq];B[mo];W[lo];B[kp]
;W[no];B[mn];W[nn];B[nm];W[np];B[om];W[ko];B[qi]LB[kq:a][jo:b][mm:c][lr:d][pr:e]C[Wang Xi: B83 is questionable. The right order is, to descend at 'a' first, next B 'b', W 'c' and B 'd', at this crucial time, Black can jump to 'e', this move is worth more than 20 points, then Black can make extension with B83 on the right side. In the real game, Black is about to collapse.]
;W[nc];B[pf];W[mm];B[ml];W[ln];B[nk]C[Zhou Heyang: Through B89, B73 and B75 are being captured, Black's loss is huge, since these two stones are key stones, at any rate Black can't give up. Now White becomes thick, Black's play will be restrained in the second half of the game.];W[kf]LB[rp:a]C[Since White is very thick, Wang Xi found out White can attach at 'a' in the lower right corner.];B[dg];W[pi];B[qj];W[oe]C[Wang Xi: W94 and W96 are good moves. White prevents Black from reducing territory and also doesn't forget the corner, Zhou Junxun is very clear.]
;B[pe];W[pb]C[Wang Lei (s) thinks, White wants to play simply, which is not good to Hu Yaoyu. Furthermore, if being sealed off in the upper right corner, Black's big dragon can only ko-live.];B[le]C[B97: Black has no other choice and can't die peacefully.];W[ne];B[lf];W[kg];B[lg];W[kh];B[ng]LB[bo:a]C[The jump of B103 is inevitable. Yu Bin thinks, Black already releases game-deciding moves. Afterwards, White must try to kill Black's big dragon by fighting a ko, Black has many local ko threats, but White has a clear good ko threat at 'a', a fierce fight is about to start.];W[bo]C[W104 is played just as expected, White is making a big ko threat.]
;B[cn];W[bn]C[Yu Bin: Zhou Junxun is also "confused", White loses two ko threats with W104 and W106.];B[bp];W[dh];B[bh]LB[cb:a][ch:b]C[Wang Xi: The order of B109 is wrong, Black should first descend at 'a' in sente, then start the ko at 'b', this way Black can use local threats in the corner and also threatens White's defect of W24 and W32, so Black is basically alive. However now the ko is worry-free to White.];W[ch];B[bi];W[bj];B[bg];W[ad]
;B[af];W[cg];B[eg];W[ge];B[ig];W[ii];B[gd];W[ec];B[ee];W[ge];B[ji];W[jh];B[gd]

;B[dp];W[ge];B[ab];W[db];B[gd];W[cq];B[bq];W[ge];B[ke];W[jf];B[gd]C[Through B151, unexpectedly Black is still very resilient and not completely loses the game.];W[kd]LB[og:a]C[Zhou Junxun misses a chance to win the game at one stroke. With W152 White should continue to fight the ko. Right now each side has three clear ko threats, but White can have lot of ko threats by playing at 'a'.]
;B[hh];W[gh];B[ge];W[ld]C[Through B156, Black has 70 points on the board, White 60+ points, the situation is very close, Black can fight.];B[qc];W[qq];B[pn];W[rq];B[bm];W[mi]LB[mj:a][nj:b][mh:c][mg:d][hp:e]C[W162 should be at 'a', next B 'b', W 'c', B 'd' and W 'e', this way Black has no chance to overturn the game.]
;B[mh];W[ni]C[W164: Zhou Junxun makes mistake, White obtains some thickness but incurs a big loss in territory.];B[li];W[lh];B[ki];W[mg];B[mf];W[jd]LB[mj:a][og:b][oh:c][nh:d][oi:e][mg:f][br:g][ai:h]C[After W170, if B 'a', then W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 'e' and W 'f', it leads to a ko fight, since White has ko threats at 'g' and 'h', Black is not good.]
;B[nh]C[Through B171, the situation becomes very complicated. White can connect out W162 and W164.];W[lk]LB[lj:a][jj:b][jk:c][ij:d][mj:e][kk:f][ll:g]C[W172 is fatal mistake, White should play at 'a', next B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f' and W 'g', Black can't kill White.];B[mj];W[oh];B[og];W[lj]
;B[jj];W[jk];B[ij];W[hk];B[nj];W[oi];B[ph];W[hp];B[ho];W[qb];B[ip];W[iq]C[Through W188, Black gets a chance to win the game.];B[gp]

;B[go];W[dm];B[cm];W[em];B[qa];W[pa];B[or];W[qs]C[Through W210, the game is very close, maybe half-point victory.];B[oc];W[ob];B[nb];W[od];B[pc]

;B[ae]LB[bl:a]C[B229 is fatal mistake, for Black to play at 'a' is absolutely sente, to block crossover, White can't take tenuki, then Black can play B229.];W[ca];B[ac];W[bl]C[W232 is double-sente one-point move.];B[am];W[lm];B[mk];W[kk];B[cl];W[dl];B[dn]
