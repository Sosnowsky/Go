;W[oc];B[de];W[dh];B[gd];W[ee];B[ef];W[fe];B[cc]C[The attachment of B13 is new. It is said that Cho Chikun first played this novel move.];W[fc]C[White jumps at 14, trying to return to the original joseki.]
(;B[db]LB[dd:a][ec:b][ff:c][ge:d][cf:e][cb:f][bc:g][eb:h]C[B15: If Black bumps at 'a', then W 'b', B 'c' and W 'd', this is a joseki (see var a); When B 'a', if W 'b', B 'e', W 'f' and B 'g', this is also a joseki (see var b). The hane of B15 in the game is relatively popular nowadays, Black expects W 'h', B 'a', W 'b' and B 'e', comparing to the joseki, the exchange of B15 and W 'h' is added, Black is a little beneficial (see var a).]
(;W[cd];B[dd];W[ec];B[cb];W[df];B[ce]TR[df]LB[cf:a][dg:b][bh:c]C[With regard to the cut of the marked stone, Black turns at 21 and White attaches at 'a', Black has obtained sente. In fact, if Black ataris at 'a', the W 'b' and B 21, this is also not bad for Black. Because after Black ataris at 'a', Black's corner is bigger, also White as a whole becomes weaker, what the most important is, if White wants to enclose territory on the left, Black can knight-invade at 'c', so B 'a' has the implication of sente in gote.];W[cf];B[ld];W[of]
;B[qf];W[pe];B[qe];W[jd]TR[ef]C[W28: White must counter-pincer here, this area is the base for both sides, if Black gets to play here, Black still can pull out the marked stone, White can't tolerate.];B[lf];W[oh];B[jf]LB[qi:a]C[The turn-capping move of B31 is Yoda's style. At this time, many people would enclose more territory at 'a', White doesn't have any special tactic to attack the center two black stones. Yoda may feel that his territory is enough, so he wants thickness.];W[qi]C[W32: White takes advantage in sente.];B[pc];W[pb]
;B[qb];W[ic]C[W36 is the vital point. If this point were taken by Black, White instead would come under attack.];B[lh];W[qn];B[ep]LB[nq:a][np:b]C[B39: Black normally will answer at 'a' or 'b'. Yoda maybe worries that White would knight-press at 39, so Black sticks his head first at 39. But no matter what, White gets to double approach the lower right corner and can be satisfied.];W[nq];B[pn];W[pm];B[on];W[qo]
;B[qp];W[mp];B[oq];W[or];B[np];W[nr];B[rp]LB[pr:a][qr:b][ps:c][qm:d][jq:e][pk:f]C[The stand of B51 is conservative. Black should block at 'a', if White pincers at 'b', then B 51, W 'c' and Black separates two stones at 'd'; Moreover, when B 'a', if White directly extends at 'e', Black would not simply stand at 51, instead Black will invade at 'f'.]
;W[pl];B[pr];W[jq]C[With W52 and W54, White has gained advantage in both sides.];B[hq];W[iq];B[hp];W[cq];B[cr];W[bp]LB[cl:a][cp:b][bo:c]C[But the play of W58 and W60 is White's wishful thinking. White should grab the big point at 'a', if B 'b', then W 'c'.]
;B[bq];W[cp];B[cl];W[br];B[bs];W[ar];B[er];W[cj];B[dn]C[With B63 and B69, Black forces White to make life in a low position, it becomes close game again.];W[bn];B[oj];W[pj];B[hg]
;W[lc];B[mc];W[kc];B[bf]LB[kp:a][lp:b][ek:c]C[B77 seems a little miserly, Black should take advantage with the sente move at 'a' and 'b', then grab the vital point at 'c'.];W[bg];B[be];W[ek];B[kp];W[kq];B[lp]

;B[ij];W[gi];B[hi];W[gh];B[gg]LB[eh:a][fl:b][fk:c][hj:d]C[The moves from B97 to B101 are bad, after White captures one stone, Black has suffered losses in territory, and Black's center also becomes thin. Black should strike at 'b', then W 'c' and B 'd', thus the center is worry-free.];W[eh];B[fl];W[gl];B[fm]
