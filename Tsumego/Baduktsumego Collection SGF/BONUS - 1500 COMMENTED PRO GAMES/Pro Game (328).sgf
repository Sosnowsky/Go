Translation:GoGameWorld.];B[pd]C[In the best-of-5 series of the 28th Japanese Gosei title, the defending champion Kobayashi tied the series at 2:2 after trailing 0:2 in the first two games, but in the final game 5 , he fell short of success for lack of a final effort and didn't turn the whole series around, it is indeed a pity!];W[dd];B[pq];W[cp];B[eq]
;W[po];B[qo];W[qn];B[qp];W[hp];B[fp];W[dn];B[cr];W[cj]LB[dr:a]C[After the approach of W6, the pincer of W10 is nimble, but the correlation between W12 and W14 is dubious, with W10, White should consider to make the knight's move at 'a'.];B[pj]LB[pn:a]C[B15: Black elects to attack with a pincer rather than cut at 'a', which is Kobayashi 9p's unique style.]
;W[nc];B[qf];W[pb];B[fc]C[After the corner-approach of B19, Black elects to double approach the corner.];W[qc];B[cf];W[fd];B[gd];W[fe];B[cc];W[ec];B[cd];W[gc]C[Through B28, Black has nothing to complain.]
;B[nd]C[B29: Black seeks to obtain sente.];W[md];B[ne];W[mc];B[kp]C[Black gets to play the pincer of B33, Black's opening is fast.];W[pk]C[White makes sabaki plays after W34.];B[qj];W[nn];B[om];W[pm];B[on];W[oo]
;B[no];W[np];B[mo];W[pn];B[op];W[nl];B[mn];W[nm]C[With the sequence from B37 to W48, Black has obtained sente and also defended his side territory, Black has succeeded in the opening.];B[jq]LB[fn:a]TR[hp]C[But B49 is slow! Black certainly should grab the vital point at 'a'! In the game, White gets to play here, it is already tasteless for Black to capture one white stone.];W[fn]
;B[ok]LB[oj:a]C[B51: The original purpose of the hane move is to take advantage in sente, unexpectedly White counterattacks by playing at 'a', leading to a complicated middle game fight, however Black should not worry anything.];W[oj];B[nj];W[oi];B[nk];W[ol];B[qk];W[ni];B[lj]LB[pl:a]C[The sequence after B59 is questionable, Black actually helps White to connect together, Black should simply takes one stone and quietly watch how White will answer.];W[li]
;B[ki];W[mi];B[lk];W[kh];B[jh];W[ji];B[kj];W[kg];B[ql]LB[ll:a][nq:b]C[B69: Because of the existence of the attachment at 'a' and the descent at 'b', Black is hard to find a way of killing White.];W[rn];B[rp]
;W[rl];B[rk];W[sl];B[ph];W[jj];B[kl];W[rq]C[In the game, after being pressed by W76 in sente, then White makes life with the clever move of W78, Black's attack has totally failed, White is favorable for the game.];B[qq];W[sp];B[rr];W[so];B[lf];W[ih]
;B[ke];W[ch];B[cg];W[dh]LB[lm:a][jm:b]C[However W86 and W88 are big slow moves under a favorable consciousness! White should jump out at 'a' to probe Black or make the shoulder-hit at 'b', White would be clearly favorable.];B[hl]C[B89 is a good point, the situation becomes unclear.];W[db];B[cb];W[hm]TR[hp]LB[lm:a]C[W92 looks like not a good move, White is still very painful even if he can connect the marked white stone, White still should consider to jump at 'a' to make trouble for Black.]
;B[il];W[br];B[cq];W[bq];B[dp];W[co];B[go]C[In the game, W94 and B99 are miai, each side takes one, White's earlier advantage has completely disappeared.];W[mg];B[me];W[ld];B[kf];W[if];B[hc]
;W[fb];B[ie];W[gl]LB[lm:a][im:b]C[The sequence after W108 is too passive! White still should consider to jump at 'a', seeking to press at 'b'.];B[gk];W[gn];B[ho];W[fk]C[In the game, the press of W110 is a big damaging move, the only gain is to enclose the territory by the double hane of W112, the game has been turned around unconsciously.];B[fl];W[gm];B[fj]
;W[ek];B[hj]LB[sq:a]C[B117 is the losing move! Black should takes at 'a', eliminating the hidden trouble of a ko, this way Black would have a chance of winning the game by a small margin.];W[gi];B[gj];W[jf];B[ej];W[dk];B[rd]LB[sr:a][pi:b][qi:c]C[B123 is the last losing move! After being haned by W 'a', Black is clearly not favorable in ko threats and forced to give way and let White push at 'b' and 'c'.]

;B[jk]LB[rc:a]C[But B149 is also small, Black should crawl at 'a', this way the difference between both sides could be narrowed down.];W[de];B[ce];W[ca];B[ba];W[da];B[ab];W[qd];B[qe];W[rc]C[After the turn of W158, Black already has no chance of winning, what a pity!];B[ng]
