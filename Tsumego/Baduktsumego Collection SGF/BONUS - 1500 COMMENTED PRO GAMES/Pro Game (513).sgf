The decisive game 5 will take place on 7/18.];W[dc]C[If not looking at player names, you definitely can't guess White is Lee Changho. In this must-win game, Lee Changho was very relaxed and his win/loss mindset was also not strong as before.];B[pq];W[dq];B[ce]
;W[di];B[oc]LB[cd:a][ed:b]C[B7 is trend, but White gets to attack first at 'a', in terms of Go theories, it is not right, for Black to play at 'a' is common.];W[cd];B[qk];W[mp];B[po];W[jp];B[cn];W[cp];B[ck]C[B13 and B15 are simple, Yun Junsang shows he is not fearful of prolonged war.]
;W[de];B[ic]LB[en:a]C[B17: For Black to play at 'a' is relatively steady.];W[en]C[After White caps with W18, White's moyo at bottom is still very significant.];B[bi];W[mm]C[W20 is vital point for both side's moyo.];B[hq]C[Black invades deeply with B21, normally White should attack right away, but Lee Changho's following play is really bold.];W[qm]C[The invasion of W22 is Black's weak point in shape.];B[no];W[mo]C[W24: Next White elects to sacrifice W22.]
;B[nn];W[mn];B[pl];W[nk];B[pi];W[nh]C[Afterwards, W28 and W30 again ignores B21 and White continues to jump to the center, White's play is very free and enjoyable! It is hard to believe Lee Changho can play this freely in such an important match!];B[jq];W[kq];B[ip]C[B31 and B33 are inexplicable, why taking initiative and making a bad shape?];W[jr];B[iq];W[qp]
;B[qq];W[in]C[W38: Black is heavy and sinks into a bitter battle.];B[kp];W[kr];B[jo];W[jm];B[ep];W[eq];B[go];W[bm]C[W46: White seeks to borrow strength and conducts two-pronged attack, Black is not easy to handle.];B[gm];W[cm]
;B[nr];W[mr];B[nq];W[mq];B[dj];W[gp]C[W54 is good move, destroying Black's eye space.];B[ho];W[ek];B[ej]C[Black pushes out with B57, normally W56 is bad move, but now White wants to attack Black's big dragon, it is very practical move.];W[fj];B[ei];W[fk]
;B[em]C[B61: Black tries to break out left and right.];W[fn]C[But following W62, White hits Black's vital point.];B[fm];W[fp];B[dn];W[dl];B[dm];W[bn];B[fo];W[eo];B[hl]C[Black is forced to run out slowly, Black's dragon is very dangerous.];W[ik]
;B[il];W[jl];B[hk]C[Black has to seek life from this narrow space, very painful.];W[ij]C[If the game is over now, this can be regarded as Lee Changho's famous game. However, the following sequence makes this game not perfect.];B[hj];W[fi];B[hi];W[ii];B[hh];W[fg];B[eh];W[fh]
;B[ih];W[ie]LB[cf:a]TR[ic]C[W86 is questionable move. White should first settle shape at 'a', this way Black can't take care of both B17 (the marked stone) and the center.];B[df]C[B87 is good move.];W[cf]LB[ee:a]C[If W88 at 'a', Black will take advantage. In the game, White counterattacks, Black makes connection. As a result, White incurs loss.];B[ef];W[ff];B[ee];W[be]
;B[fe];W[cl]C[W94 can be said Lee Changho's style, but most players wouldn't play this almost dame move.];B[hd];W[hf];B[jk]C[B97 sacrificing is good move.];W[kk];B[jh];W[ki];B[kh];W[rq];B[ro];W[li]
;B[ge];W[hg];B[lf]C[B107: Black finally runs out.];W[jc]C[Now the situation becomes close.];B[jb];W[jd]C[In the following endgame war, Lee Changho plays brilliantly.];B[kb];W[rd];B[qe];W[ld];B[ke];W[lc]

;W[qc];B[re];W[pc];B[od];W[ob];B[nb];W[pb];B[oh];W[oi];B[pg];W[fb]C[After a series of eye-dazzling exchanges, White finally gets to take the super big endgame with W140, establishes a slight advantage, and successfully carries this advantage to the end.];B[lb];W[rc]
