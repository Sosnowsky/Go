Copyright by gogameworld.com and weiqi.tom.com.]RE[W+R];B[pd];W[dd];B[qp];W[dp];B[fq];W[dn]C[As to the corner-approach of B5, recently White gradually tends to jump with W6 more, its purpose is to stress on the invasion later on.]
;B[kq];W[iq];B[ko]LB[jo:a][eq:b][hp:c][fp:d][hq:e]C[B9: Black can also make knight at 'a', White will still bump at 'b', next B 'c', W 'd' and B 'e', it forms an exchange.];W[eq];B[pj];W[io];B[op];W[jm]
;B[ci]C[W14 and B15 are miai good points, each side gets one.];W[ck];B[cf];W[ce];B[df];W[fd];B[co];W[do];B[cq]C[B21 and B23 are early left weak points in White's corner, showing Lee Changho thorough study to this local variation.];W[dr];B[cm]LB[cn:a]C[B25: If Black crawls at 'a', Black can make life but will make White very thick on the outside, it is not to Black's advantage.]
;W[cn];B[bn];W[cp];B[er];W[dq];B[dk];W[dl]LB[dj:a][cl:b];B[cl]LB[ek:a][in:b]C[B33: Black should extend at 'a', aiming to attach and cut at 'b'.];W[dj]
;B[bk];W[ek];B[cj]LB[jr:a]C[In this local variation, Black obtains some territory, but White is very thick, I think Lee Changho's opening is not successful.];W[qq];B[pq];W[rp];B[rq];W[nc];B[pf];W[pb];B[km]LB[jn:a]C[B45: Black can consider to play crude move at 'a' then hang with B45. Since White is already very thick, this kind of "amateur" move is playable in special situation.

Black's direction for fighting following B45 is clearly wrong.]
;W[kl];B[jl];W[lm];B[kn];W[kk]C[In the real game, White gets to turn body around.];B[in];W[qo];B[qr];W[ql];B[qk];W[pl];B[nj];W[ml]C[Through W58, White already opens up the situation. So far, White's situation is optimistic.]
;B[mc]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.];W[md];B[lc];W[nb]LB[qi:a]C[W62: White wants to make diagonal at 3-3. Due to the aji at 'a', Black is not thick on the right side.];B[qc];W[ld];B[kc];W[ic];B[kd];W[od];B[kf]
;W[oe];B[pg];W[bf]C[W72 is to prevent Black from entering the corner.];B[ho];W[gp];B[bg];W[ie]C[Now the game is close.];B[if];W[je];B[ke];W[mf];B[me]
;W[ne]LB[le:a][qb:b]C[W82 is inexplicable, I think White certainly should capture at 'a'! In the game, once Black blocks at 'b', White will be very painful.];B[jf];W[be]C[W84 is huge, the defense and offense on the right side will be the key for the game.];B[jk];W[jj]LB[kj:a][fn:b]C[W86: If White extends at 'a' normally, White is easy to make life, but after Black becomes thick, Black's strike at 'b' is very severe.];B[kj];W[im]LB[ji:a]C[W88 is wrong order, White should first extend at 'a'.]
;B[hl];W[hm];B[hk];W[ji];B[lj];W[hi]C[It seems White can't capture Black's four stones in the center.];B[gi]C[B95: White is dangerous.];W[gh];B[fi];W[hj];B[fk];W[gj]

(;B[fj]LB[gm:a][gl:b][gk:c][fl:d][hn:e][dm:f]C[B101: If Black plays hane at 'a', next W 'b', B 'c', W101, B 'd', W 'e' and B 'f', then White makes life, Black is a little dissatisfied.];W[gk];B[gl];W[fl];B[gm];W[hn]LB[gn:a][fm:b][em:c]C[W106: If White plays hane at 'a', then B 'b' and W 'c', making a ko, but since White has no proper ko threats, this is not working.]
;B[gn];W[go];B[em];W[dm];B[el];W[fh];B[ei];W[hg];B[he]C[B115: If Black captures the right side and White captures the top, Black's territory is not enough.];W[ff];B[hc];W[gc];B[hb]
;W[hd];B[id];W[jd];B[jc];W[ok];B[oj];W[mn];B[no]C[Now if White makes life painfully on the right side, White's territory will be inadequate. After the attachment of B85, White fails badly in the fight, White must make life in maximum limit in order to have a chance to win.];W[nn];B[po]LB[mk:a]C[B129: Black should first exchange B 'a', then play B129.];W[mk]C[W130 is alert, White makes life comfortably, White again is hopeful to win the game.]
;B[id]LB[gb:a][fb:b][ge:c]C[B131 again is slow, Black should turn at 'a', after W 'b', then B 'c', this is clearly better.

From Weiqi.tom.com, B131 is a huge mistake, Black takes three stones but loses the precious sente. Chang Hao grabs this chance and counterattacks strongly.];W[lp];B[kp];W[bl]C[W134 is not necessary, if playing the ko directly, Black is already very difficult to handle.];B[dk];W[lq];B[mo];W[ck];B[bm]
;W[di];B[dk];W[eh];B[fm];W[ck];B[fo]C[After B145, if White eliminates the ko, it seems Black has to concede.];W[fp]C[W146: White loses the chance to win the game at one stroke, now the situation is again chaotic.];B[dk];W[lo];B[lr];W[ck];B[hp]
;W[hq];B[dk];W[pe];B[ln]C[B155 is an impulsive move under time pressure. In fact to answer the ko threat is also fine.];W[ck];B[lk];W[ll];B[dk];W[qe];B[ej];W[mj];B[rf];W[re]C[After the exchange up to W164, Black again becomes favorable. If White loses, W146 is a regrettable move!]
;B[kh];W[qn];B[jn]LB[fb:a]C[B167: Black should jump to 'a', White is difficult to answer.];W[dh]C[White takes tenuki alertly with W168. Black will win slightly if playing endgame normally.];B[ch];W[gd];B[ga];W[eb];B[ea];W[da];B[fa]
;W[db];B[bo];W[ip];B[jr];W[rg];B[rh];W[qf];B[qg];W[sf];B[mi];W[on]C[Now the game is close but White is a little better.];B[bq];W[oo]
