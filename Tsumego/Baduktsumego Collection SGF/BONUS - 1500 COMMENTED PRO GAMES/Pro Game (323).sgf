Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[In the game 6 of the 29th Japanese Meijin Title match, the challenger Cho U 9p took Black and defeated Yoda Norimoto by 1.5 points, therefore obtaining the title successfully by a total score of 4:2.];W[dd];B[pp];W[cp];B[eq]
;W[oc];B[ld];W[me];B[od];W[nd]LB[pd:a]C[As to the two-space high pincer of B7, with W10 White normally will wedge at 'a', the play in the game is a new variation.];B[oe];W[pc];B[qc];W[le];B[jd];W[lc];B[fc]
;W[qg];B[og];W[rf];B[qe];W[qj];B[cf]C[However, Black gets to double approach with B23 and should have nothing to complain.];W[fd];B[gd];W[ec];B[fe];W[ed];B[fb];W[ge]
;B[hd];W[ce]LB[ff:a][cc:b]C[W32: The correct move is to atari at 'a', but this way Black can enter the corner at 'b', this will lead to another game.];B[df];W[ee]C[White can only play the crude atari with W34, the result can't be good for White.];B[kc];W[lb];B[eb];W[ff];B[cj]LB[cm:a][cn:b]C[B39 is a satisfactory attitude, for Black to pincer at 'a' or 'b' instead is more positive.]
;W[cm];B[jq];W[kb];B[cc];W[be];B[ej]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.];W[qn];B[np];W[qq];B[qp];W[rp];B[pq];W[rr]
;B[qr];W[rq]C[White can be satisfied with the sequence from W42 to W54.];B[dn]LB[cq:a][bq:b][br:c]C[B55: Black can also directly attach at 'a', next W 'b' and B 'c', grabbing territory with the double hane.];W[cn];B[cq];W[bq];B[dp];W[co];B[cr]
;W[db];B[cb];W[dc];B[da];W[ic];B[hb];W[oi]C[W68 aims at Black's thinness in the upper right corner.];B[om];W[pm];B[nl]LB[fm:a]C[After B69, the diagonal move of B71 is questionable. Black should make the knight's seal at 'a', which is the urgent point in this situation.];W[on]
;B[nn];W[dk];B[dj];W[fm]C[In the game, White gets to stick his head out with W76, Black's moyo is being restricted, and Black's several stones on the left side also become thin.];B[pl];W[ql];B[gn];W[gm];B[hn];W[ib]C[W82: White takes advantage in sente.];B[id];W[if]
;B[hc];W[ch]C[The invasion of W86 is severe. Black has no choice but to make a comprise.

After this move, the game was closed for the first day.];B[dh];W[cg];B[bf];W[dg];B[eg];W[ef];B[bh];W[eh];B[bg];W[fg];B[ci]C[Through B97, White makes himself thicker on the whole board in sente, then starts reduction at the bottom bravely.]
;W[mm];B[oo];W[pn];B[lm]C[As to the peep of W98, after the atari of B99, the attachment of B101 is an unusual tactic, the purpose is to protect the side territory.];W[mn];B[nm];W[jn]LB[ml:a][mo:b]C[W104: For White to play at 'a' is common, but Black can secure territory by playing at 'b'.];B[ml];W[km]C[W104 and W106 are good moves in this situation.];B[ko]
;W[jo];B[jp]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.];W[fn];B[gp];W[lo];B[kl];W[ln];B[ll];W[jl];B[jk];W[il]C[Through W118, locally White is successful.];B[do]
;W[ck]C[The exchange of B119 and W120 is damaging, but Black has no other alternative in order to pound at White's center.];B[br];W[fo]C[With W122, Yoda has been deeply thinking for about 53 minutes.];B[hp];W[kj]LB[kp:a][mp:b]C[W124 is wrong order, White should first play at 'a' and 'b', Black couldn't resist.];B[jj];W[ki];B[kk];W[pb]LB[re:a]C[W128: White still should crawl at 'a', if proceeding normally, White is slightly favorable.]
;B[mg];W[nh];B[ng];W[lh];B[re];W[qb];B[rb];W[ra];B[sc];W[kp]LB[gk:a]C[W138: For White to play at 'a' instead is the original move.];B[kq];W[mp]
;B[gk]C[The counterattack of B141 is the game-deciding move.];W[hk];B[hj];W[fk];B[gj];W[gl];B[ek];W[dm];B[mq];W[lp];B[lq]C[Through B151, both sides are steady.];W[jc]
;B[bd];W[kd]LB[pg:a]C[W154 is a mistake, White should bump at 'a' instead.];B[nc]C[B155 is a good move!];W[pr]LB[pg:a]C[After W156, the game is very close, but before this White still should first bump at 'a'.];B[or];W[qs];B[nb];W[mc];B[pj]
;W[pi];B[qk];W[rk];B[pk];W[rj];B[eg];W[os];B[nr];W[bp];B[bj];W[bk];B[hf]C[B161 and B173 are good moves!];W[he]
