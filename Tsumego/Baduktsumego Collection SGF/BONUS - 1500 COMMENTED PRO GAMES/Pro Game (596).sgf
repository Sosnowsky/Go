Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[pd]C[In this game Chang Hao underperformed. He always plays steadily, but in this game he suddenly became extremely aggressive, some moves are hard to understand.];W[dd];B[pq]C[B1 and B3 are often used by Chang Hao recently.];W[dp];B[fq]
;W[cn];B[jp];W[qf]C[W8 is rarely seen, White kind of tries to avoid the opponent's familiar pattern.];B[pi];W[of];B[nd]C[B11: For Black to make the common small knight's move is still better, the play in the game is not successful.];W[rd];B[fc];W[qc];B[cf];W[df]C[As to W16, the common saying is to press strong not weak, but recently the view is to play practically according to different situations.];B[dg]
;W[ef];B[ce];W[cd];B[jc];W[pn]C[Of course, the purpose of W22 is to hope Black answer in the corner.];B[qp]LB[ql:a]C[Therefore, with B23, Black can consider to attack with the pincer at 'a'.];W[pk];B[ni];W[hq]C[White ignores the right side weak group and invades positively with W26! Yamashiro's fighting posture is live on the board.];B[nk];W[ho]
;B[nn];W[qo];B[op];W[qk]LB[hp:a]C[Black (B27 and B29) allows White (W30 and W32) make life easily, Black's attack fails. With B27, for Black to press at 'a' is relatively better.];B[iq]LB[cj:a]C[Although B33 protecting the corner is huge, but it is Black's losing cause! If Black plays at 'a' instead, Black can settle himself and also aims to attack White's corner.];W[di]C[W34 sinks Black's three stones into passive state.];B[eg];W[ff];B[fg]
;W[gf];B[ch];W[hc];B[bj];W[hd]TR[fc]C[White captures B13 with W42, White's profit is huge.];B[pc]LB[ib:a]C[B43 is careless! Black's situation has deteriorated. With B43 Black should first play the sente move at 'a', then block with B43.];W[lc]C[After White invades with W44, Black can't capture, then Black doesn't get any points with B43.];B[ld];W[kc];B[kd]
;W[jb];B[rh]C[Because Black's territory is inadequate, with the sequence following B49 Black has to start far-fetched attack, but White's two groups are easy to handle, Black will come to nothing eventually.];W[pg];B[ph];W[rj];B[qm];W[rn];B[rf];W[re];B[pm];W[rm];B[qg]C[B59: Black initiates a ko fight by favorable ko threats.]
;W[sf];B[sg];W[rg];B[ib];W[ic];B[rf];W[pb];B[jd];W[kb];B[se];W[qe];B[ob];W[qb]C[After W72, White basically makes life, Black's profit is limited.]
;B[rp];W[om];B[ol]C[Black again starts to attack with B73 and B75.];W[on];B[pl];W[nm];B[qn];W[ro];B[po];W[ql];B[og];W[pf];B[mm]
;W[nl];B[ok];W[ml];B[sl];W[ri];B[sk];W[qi];B[qh];W[pj];B[si];W[sj];B[rk];W[sh]
;B[hb];W[gb];B[si];W[mk]C[Although Black uses the tesuji of B89 to ko-kill White, but on the outside White gets to turn with W102 as ko threat, Black has to withdraw inside in order to reduce White's ko threats, White's big group gradually becomes lighter.];B[oj];W[sh];B[gc];W[ia];B[si];W[ip];B[io];W[sh];B[fb]
;W[ha];B[si];W[hp];B[qj];W[jq]C[White captures one stone with W116 and forms an exchange, overall Black surprisingly incurs loss!];B[dq];W[cq]C[Yamashiro's nickname is "permeation style", it means making opponents falling behind unconsciously, in this game his reputation is also really deserved.];B[cr];W[dr];B[eq];W[br];B[cp]
;W[bq];B[do];W[dn];B[fo];W[co];B[ep];W[bp];B[en];W[kp];B[de];W[ed];B[ee];W[fd]
;B[mp];W[ck];B[bk];W[cl];B[mn]LB[fm:a]C[B141 is an overplay, although Black is not favorable, but Black has to tolerate to make life by playing at 'a', then find a chance to win the game.];W[fm]C[W142 is the vital point! Black at the bottom is too painful!];B[er];W[cs];B[gn]C[Although Black escapes successfully with the sequence following B145, but White takes the chance to attack Black's four stones on the outside, delivering a fatal blow to Black at the top!];W[hl];B[gm]
;W[gl];B[im];W[jo];B[in];W[jk];B[lq];W[lp];B[kn];W[mq];B[mr];W[nq];B[lr];W[np]

;B[if];W[hf];B[mc];W[me];B[md];W[jf];B[kg];W[ig];B[ke];W[ik];B[mi];W[li];B[nb]C[After White jumps to W170, although Black can manage to ko-live with B199, but White is absolutely favorable in ko threats, Black's defeat is already decided.]
