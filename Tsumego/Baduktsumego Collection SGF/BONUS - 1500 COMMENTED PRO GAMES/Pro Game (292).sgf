;B[fr]C[As for the result up to B33, the position is exactly same as the one which was played before long in the Samsung final between Chang Hao and Cho Hunhyun. It seems both Chang Hao and Ma Xiaochun have their own understanding and it also shows both sides' strong state of mind.];W[nq]LB[gm:a][cs:b][ce:c]C[W34: White first starts to vary, in the game with Cho Hunhyun, Chang Hao played at 'a', followed by B 'b' and W 'c'.];B[cs];W[ec]LB[ce:a]C[W36: The direction of protecting the corner also changes, in the Cho-Chang's game, White played at 'a'.];B[pq];W[kq];B[lp]C[B39: Black has many choices.]
;W[lq];B[np];W[mp];B[mo];W[mq];B[no]TR[kq][lq][mq][nq][mp]C[Through 45, Black is very thick and also left with the possibility of attacking the five marked white stones.];W[qi]C[The splitting move of W46 is a steady play.];B[qk]LB[qg:a]C[B47: While considering about the outside configuration at the bottom, Black doesn't elect to play at 'a'.]
;W[qf];B[re]LB[qe:a][pf:b][nd:c]C[B49 is unyielding, the common play is to make the diagonal's move at 'a', followed by B 'b' and W 'c'.];W[nc]LB[rf:a]C[W50 is a tit-for-tat play, if White blocks at 'a', it seems that Black would have already taken advantage in sente.];B[oe]C[B51 is a mutual good point.];W[oq]C[W52: White breaks away from the main battlefield, it appears slow.];B[oi]C[B53: Black tenukis to attack, White is not comfortable.];W[op]C[W54 doesn't seem to have any threat to Black.]
;B[pn];W[rk];B[rl];W[rf];B[qd];W[rj];B[pg]C[B61: Black prevents White from sticking his head out here.];W[ql];B[rm];W[pk];B[rh]C[B65: Black wouldn't allow White to live completely by just one move.];W[qh]
;B[lc]C[B67: Black doesn't attack White immediately in fear of ending in gote on the right side.];W[pp];B[qq];W[ol];B[md];W[jb]C[W72 is an unusual play but very practical.];B[bd];W[ce]LB[bf:a]C[W74 is a steady move, White has no assurance of success if trying to kill at 'a'.];B[be];W[bf];B[cf]
;W[bg];B[cc];W[db];B[cb];W[df];B[dc];W[eb];B[bb]C[Through 85, both sides are roughly acceptable.];W[rc]LB[lb:a]C[W86 is an asking move, because White can play the attachment at 'a', White has some room for maneuver inside White's territory.];B[rd];W[nd]
;B[me];W[lb];B[mb];W[mc];B[kb];W[kc];B[la];W[ld]
(;B[kd]LB[lb:a][ne:b][nf:c][mf:d][nb:e]C[B97: If Black connects at 'a', then W 'b', B 'c' and W97, 'd' and 'e' would become miai, Black is no good (see var a).];W[lb];B[ck];W[lc];B[bj]C[Through 101, a big exchange has resulted, just from territory's viewpoint, Black is favorable, but White obtains sente and also can gain profit by attacking White, so the situation is still not clear.];W[qc];B[pc];W[pb]
;B[ob];W[qa];B[pf]LB[oc:a][ne:b]C[B107: If Black connects at 'a', then White will push at 'b', Black is not comfortable.];W[oc];B[mg];W[dj]C[W110 is a good point for both sides.];B[cj];W[di];B[jg]LB[dk:a]C[B113 is a good reduction point, Black also aims at the push and cut at 'a'.]
;W[jf]C[W114 is tight and has the intention of obtaining sente.];B[ig];W[kg];B[kh];W[kf];B[ji]C[Through 119, Black has nothing to complain.];W[ak]C[W120 is a clever move.];B[aj];W[dk]C[W122 is kind of sente.];B[ao]C[B123: If Black tenukis, then W123, Black is hard to kill White.];W[lh]
;B[li];W[mh];B[mi];W[lg];B[nh];W[nj]C[W130: White aims to take advantage in sente.];B[oj]C[B131 is a strong resistance.];W[ng]LB[nk:a]C[W132 seems not good, White should directly retreat at 'a'.];B[og];W[ni];B[nf]
;W[nk]C[Through 136, White ends in gote and cant' be satisfied.];B[pm]LB[on:a]C[B137 is the vital point, which not only mitigates White's attachment at 'a' and also turns White into an unstable situation.];W[kj]C[W138: White already has no good move to strengthen himself so he can only fight regardless of danger.];B[ok];W[pl];B[nl]C[B139 and B141 are inevitable counterattack.];W[ml];B[nm];W[lk];B[ki]LB[pj:a][ik:b]C[B145 is a steady play, if Black elects to kill White by playing at 'a', then W 'b', Black is dangerous.]
;W[om];B[on];W[mm];B[nn];W[ik];B[jk];W[jj]C[W152 is a tesuji for managing weak stones.];B[ij];W[lj];B[hj];W[il];B[gk];W[hh]
;B[ih];W[pj]C[W160: White has to come back and strengthen.];B[mj];W[mk];B[ln];W[lm];B[gm]C[B163 and B165: Black is not hurry, not leaving White any chance for a desperate fight.];W[kn];B[sf]C[B167 is a good move, White is painful.];W[rg];B[sg];W[ri]
;B[sh];W[si];B[se];W[pi];B[oh];W[sk];B[gf]C[B177 is the safest play.];W[if];B[hf];W[fh];B[hg];W[gd];B[rb]
;W[qb];B[sc];W[ra];B[ko];W[jo]C[W188: White seeks a way of conceding defeat.];B[jn];W[km];B[io];W[jp];B[hn]LB[jl:a][jr:b]C[Through 193, if White makes life by playing at 'a', then B 'b', White's territory is clearly inadequate and White is forced to resign.]
