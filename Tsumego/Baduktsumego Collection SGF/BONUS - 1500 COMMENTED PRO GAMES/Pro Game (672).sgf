;W[ed];B[oc];W[do];B[cm];W[bo]LB[cq:a]C[W10: The common move is to attach at 'a'.];B[fp];W[en];B[dk];W[hq];B[hp];W[ip];B[ho]
;W[eq];B[ep];W[dp];B[dr]LB[er:a][ci:b]C[As to the challenge of new move from Yamada Kimio, Takao Shinji attacks back with the beautiful move of B21, thus starts the attack running until White's big dragon gets killed. In fact, just recently Xie He uses B21 this move to defeat Lee Sedol, Yamada Kimio didn't see that game? Although the situation is a little different, but it is still a favorable move now. If Black plays at 'a' as joseki, Black will end in gote and White will get to invade at 'b', Black is not good.];W[fr];B[fq];W[gr];B[er];W[el];B[hm]C[B27 is a good move! Black strengthens himself and also takes chance to attack.]
;W[io]LB[in:a][gn:b]C[W28 entices Black to hang at 'a', then White is very happy to peep at 'b'.];B[fm]C[B29: Black sees through White's intention, to peep first is a good move.];W[dl]LB[em:a]C[W30 is crude, if connecting at 'a', White's eye shape is better.];B[cl];W[cn];B[in];W[ko];B[bq]C[B35 is related to the base of both sides, this kind of vital place normally can't be missed.]
;W[gl];B[gm];W[gj];B[dj];W[df];B[cg];W[np]LB[eh:a]C[With W42, locally White forms an efficient shape, its value is huge, but for White to first strengthen at 'a' is much better to help the big dragon.];B[ql];W[qj]C[With B43 and W44, both sides should play in the upper left corner.];B[qo];W[qg]
;B[dg]C[B47 separating White is severe.];W[ic];B[id]C[Next B49 is strong and unyielding! This move is very damaging to territory, and the risk is also very big, but it shows Honinbo's boldness and momentum!];W[hc];B[jd];W[jc];B[hd]C[B53 is also an unusual tactic, clearly showing a killing posture.];W[kd];B[fd];W[fc];B[gc];W[gb]
;B[gd];W[eb];B[ke];W[fl]LB[le:a]C[W62 is weak! If playing hane at 'a' tenaciously and betting on the life-and-death of the big dragon, White would have more chances.];B[kc];W[ld];B[lc];W[le];B[jb];W[ib];B[ia];W[hb]
;B[lf];W[kf];B[je];W[me];B[lg]C[B71 and B75 are all strong and good moves!];W[oe]LB[mc:a][mb:b][lb:c][kb:d][nb:e][la:f][nc:g][ob:h][na:i][nf:j]C[With W76, if White hangs at 'a', then B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f', W 'g', B 'h', W 'i' and B 'j', White is not good.]
;B[mc];W[qe];B[pd];W[re]LB[ng:a]C[W80 grabbing territory is an overplay, to jump at 'a' is just the original move.];B[nf];W[mf];B[mg];W[ne];B[ij]LB[qh:a]C[When B85, if White makes life the left side, after Black reinforces the center, Black has the tesuji of attaching at 'a' on the right side, White is not easy to handle.];W[rc]C[W86: White exploits Black's corner first, if Black can't capture the big dragon, Black's territory is definitely not enough.]
;B[bm]C[However, after B87, powerful Takao Shinji kills White's big dragon, in terms of the process, there are many variations, but White doesn't have a way to make life, since White's big dragon doesn't have even one eye. Looking back, with W86, White should make life at 87.];W[gh];B[hi];W[eg];B[eh];W[ei];B[fg];W[di];B[bi];W[ik];B[hk];W[hj];B[hl]

;W[lj]C[Yamada Kimio again continues the game with almost a hundred moves, however he already has no chance to overturn the game.];B[jl];W[nb];B[li];W[nc];B[ng];W[cf];B[bf];W[bg];B[bh];W[hg];B[ih];W[mi]
