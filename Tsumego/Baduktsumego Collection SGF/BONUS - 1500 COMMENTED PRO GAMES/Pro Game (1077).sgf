;B[fq];W[cn];B[kq];W[qj];B[pk]LB[qk:a]C[The shoulder hit B9 and the attachment at 'a' are both popular plays recently.];W[qk];B[ql];W[rl];B[pj]LB[qm:a][rm:b][qn:c][ok:d][qf:e]C[If B13 retreats to 'a', then W 'b', B 'c', W 'd' and B 'e'.]
;W[qm]LB[rm:a][qi:b][pl:c][pi:d][ol:e][np:f]C[If W14 extends to 'a', it may lead to the variation: B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e' and B 'f'.];B[pl];W[qi];B[pm];W[qn];B[pn];W[jo]LB[qo:a][po:b][pp:c]C[W20 can also hit at 'a', following by B 'b' and W 'c' cut, but the result is not ideal. Through 20, the game proceeds very fast, it is obvious that both sides are well prepared.]

;B[iq]C[Through the opening to 47, both sides stress on territory, it seems White can fight.];W[nc];B[kd];W[pb];B[qc];W[ne];B[hc]C[B53 is kind of sente.];W[bf]LB[cc:a]C[W54 prevents Black from entering the corner at 'a'.];B[bg];W[be];B[fd]
;W[ec];B[md];W[nd];B[mb]C[B61 is a good move.];W[nb];B[qg];W[qb];B[rb];W[qf];B[qe];W[rf];B[pf];W[rg]
;B[rm]C[B71 is good timing.];W[rk];B[qh];W[rh];B[ng];W[me];B[mc];W[ke];B[lh]LB[pg:a]C[B79 guards against White's cut and atari at 'a'.];W[jd];B[kc]
;W[jf];B[ie];W[je];B[ib]C[Through 85, from territory point of view, White is not bad, but Black is thicker. The focal point now is how White can successfully handle his two weak groups, one at the top and one at the bottom. ];W[id];B[hd];W[he];B[if]C[B89 extending out leaves both sides no route of retreat.];W[ig];B[hf];W[ge]LB[jh:a]C[W92 is clearly an overplay, a tiger at 'a' is the proper move.]

;W[kg]LB[oc:a][ob:b][na:c][pc:d][od:e][rc:f][rd:g]C[Through 126, if Black decides to kill White, Black has to make a ko in the upper right, for example, B 'a', W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 'e', W 'f' and B 'g', this will result in a ko fight, but this way to kill is not easy for Black.];B[gn]C[B127 turns to attack white weak stones at the bottom, now White has advantage in territory, Black must make some profit by attacking.];W[mj];B[hm];W[ll];B[kl]
;W[pi];B[rd]C[The exchange of W132 for W133 appears to dig his own grave.];W[lm];B[lk];W[mk];B[ml]C[After B137 separates White into two parts, one will die for sure.];W[go];B[fo];W[fn];B[fm];W[gp];B[en]
