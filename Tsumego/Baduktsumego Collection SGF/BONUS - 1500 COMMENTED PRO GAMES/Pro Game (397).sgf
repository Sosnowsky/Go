;B[cc];W[po];B[qm];W[qq];B[qr];W[qp];B[mq];W[rr];B[pr];W[on]C[The moves from B1 to W16 are all normal.];B[qj];W[pe];B[pd]LB[qe:a]C[But the position of B17 is a little low, after White presses with the knight's move of W18, usually Black will crawl at 'a', but due to the existence of B17, Black already can't play this way. In the game, Black has no other choice but to push and cut strongly with B19, but it is still a little unreasonable.]

;B[ol];W[ni]LB[nj:a][nl:b][lg:c]C[W34 is a move that I regret. If White plays at 'a', Black would be more difficult to handle. Because after W 'a', next no matter White answers with the cap at 'b' or 'c', Black would all face a difficult situation.];B[kf];W[pk]C[W36: Locally Black has incurred some loss.];B[pj];W[ok];B[oj];W[nj];B[nk]
;W[nl];B[mk];W[pl];B[oi];W[nh];B[qg];W[kh];B[ic];W[me];B[jq]LB[nf:a]C[Black has no choice but to play B51, Black can't connect at 'a', if White gets to play at 51 to attack Black, Black would sink into passivity.];W[cb];B[cd]
;W[fc]LB[bb:a]C[For White to strengthen with W54 is just right, next if White sticks his head out at 'a', Black couldn't tolerate, so in the game Black hanes at 'a'.];B[bb];W[hd]TR[ic]C[But after the knight's cap of W56, the marked black stone is in trouble. Afterwards, White attacks Black, White's tempo is good.];B[jd];W[kc];B[ie];W[gf];B[ig];W[ii];B[hc]
;W[eb]C[In the escaping process, the exchange of B63 with W64 is a big damaging move!];B[nf];W[lf];B[lg];W[le];B[kg];W[mg];B[lh];W[ba]C[After the hane of W72, White's advantage is obvious.];B[ci];W[eq];B[cl]
;W[li]C[After the block of W76, White has further established his superiority.];B[jh];W[ki]LB[ef:a]C[W78 is a big careless move! This is the move I regret the most. If White first jumps to 'a', forcing Black to reinforce on the left side, then White connects with W78, this way Black wouldn't have any chance.];B[ji];W[jj];B[ij];W[ih];B[jg];W[jk];B[ik];W[il]
;B[gk];W[oh]LB[kj:a][qh:b]C[W88 can't be omitted. First, it indirectly guards against Black's cut at 'a', Second, White is left with the follow-up maneuver of playing at 'b'.];B[jl];W[kj];B[fe]C[B91 is alert! Black strongly encloses a big territory in order to have a chance to win.];W[qh];B[gd];W[hl];B[gl];W[rh]C[However, up to W96, the game is still to White's advantage.]
;B[cn];W[hk];B[hj];W[gj];B[hi];W[gm];B[fm]LB[fl:a]C[When White hanes with W102, now normally Black can only play at 'a' to make an inefficient shape, in the game Black realizes that he is not favorable so elects to hane at 103, as result, a hidden trouble is left.];W[fj];B[fk]LB[ef:a]TR[ij]C[When White extends with W104, Black has no other choice but to connect with B105, otherwise when White strikes at 'a', after Black connects, White can capture the four marked stones in a ladder.]
;W[ek];B[fl];W[ee]LB[ed:a]C[The wedge of W108 is a good move! Black dares not atari at 'a', this way the aji is too bad, White easily finds something inside Black's territory.];B[ef];W[ed];B[df];W[ff];B[ge];W[dm];B[fn]LB[cm:a]C[When White hits with W114, B115 seems a desperate move. Normally Black can only connect at 'a'.]
;W[cm];B[dn];W[bl]C[In the game White pushes with W116 and hanes with W118, White makes life inside Black's big moyo, Black fails completely! Up to here, the game has already been decided.];B[bn];W[ck];B[im]LB[fi:a]C[B121 is sente, otherwise Black can strike at 'a' strongly, White's big dragon can't find two eyes, it would be too late for White to regret.];W[bi]LB[eo:a][en:b][dq:c]C[However, before White makes life with W122, if White first peeps at 'a', forcing Black to connect at 'b', this way Black's tactic of attaching at 'c' to White's worry-free corner would be gone. This will be a safe continuation for White. In the game, luckily White is thick on the board, after living the lower left big group, Black is left with no chance.];B[dq]
