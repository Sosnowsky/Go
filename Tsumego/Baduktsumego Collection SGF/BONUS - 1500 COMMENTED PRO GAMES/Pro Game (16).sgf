I think the game 2 is a coarse game for me.];B[qd]C[The second game was held in the same place, Tom Corporation, with same game interface, http://duiyi.tom.com. However, the difference is the state of mind in the game, because I didn't fully get into condition. So before this game I have set a small target for myself --- giving a full play to my ability.];W[dd];B[pq]C[The small-point opening is my favorite.];W[oc];B[dp]
;W[po];B[kd];W[qq];B[fc];W[cf];B[pc];W[od]LB[qj:a]C[From the surrounding configuration, the extension of W12 is not good timing, this is also the root cause that leads to White's passivity in the opening, why? First, 'a' is the mutual best extension point, no matter how to proceed in the upper right corner, only if Black grabs the point 'a', Black can be satisfied. Second, if White wants to settle W4 and w12, the gap between B7 and B9 will become ideal. Therefore, the extension of W12 is hasty, playing at 'a' is normal.];B[pf];W[le];B[ke];W[lf];B[kf]
;W[lg]C[Although the sequence from W14 to W18 is the normal play to escape, but now White is very reluctant, Black is too smooth and fluent on both the left and right side.];B[ld];W[md];B[mc]LB[ne:a][qi:b]C[If White plays the usual tiger's move at 'a', Black will make the extension at 'b', White can't be satisfied.];W[ph]C[The forcing move of W22, I think, is a must.];B[ne]LB[nd:a][of:b]C[B23: Black has thought for 5 minutes for this move, it is a good move to make White painful. Here if Black plays the atari at 'a', White will attach at 'b', Black doesn't have any severe tactic.];W[nd]LB[pd:a][qc:b][of:c]C[W24 absolutely shouldn't be played, this connection with an inefficient shape is a powerless withdrawal, later on for White to strike here again is already completely tasteless. After consulting a lot of top players, all their first feeling is to squeeze at 'a' and counterattack with the crosscut at 'c', not only we should play this way, what the most important is momentum. In fact with W24, I also had considered to play at 'a', 'b' or 'c', but at that time it is very hard to calculate precisely, so I elects to retreat. Then why I lack the confidence of "where I can't calculate precisely, you can't either"?]
;B[oh]C[After Black separates with B25, White is completely in a helpless state, Black is initiative.];W[qh]LB[pi:a][pg:b][nf:c]C[W26: From the result, to play at 'a', then B 'b' and W 'c', is better, this way White is much smoother to get out.];B[qf];W[oi];B[og];W[nf];B[ni];W[oj];B[nj]
;W[ok];B[ki]LB[oe:a][me:b][kh:c]C[With the sealing off of B35, Black is very happy, Gueon Hyojin said after the game. On the other hand, I feel very bad, I also have some fear in my pain, if Black destroys eye shape by playing at 'a', W 'b' and B 'c', White's big dragon would be very dangerous.];W[of]C[With the squeezing move of W36, White has ensured safety.];B[pg]LB[mh:a]C[B37: How come Black connects with a dame move? Obviously to play at 'a' is better!];W[mh];B[nh]C[White reinforces again with W38, and Black doesn't hesitate to connect with B39, it is to my surprise, it seems that Black's favorable consciousness is too strong.];W[lb]
;B[mb]
(;W[me]LB[pd:a][qc:b][kh:c][jh:d][ng:e]C[W42: White draws back again, to make life here, White can make two more extra points! With the sequence of W 'a', B 'b', W 'c', B 'd' and W 'e', White can simply live (see var a). In the game I didn't see to play this way, I must have been a little panic at that time!];B[om]C[From B43, Black enters into 3 time 30 seconds byo-yomi, I also don't have much time left.]
(;W[pm]LB[qm:a][pp:b][qk:c][oq:d][np:e]C[W44 is very farfetched, clearly knowing Black can use tesuji here, how to tolerate if Black jumps down to 'a'? Now I think, for White to hit at 'b' is the original move, then B 'a', W 'c', B 'd' and W 'e', this variation is relatively natural (see var a).];B[pl];W[ol];B[pn];W[qm];B[pp];W[qp];B[qo]
;W[oo]C[W52: Perhaps White can only atari over at 'a'.]LB[ro:a];B[ro];W[pr];B[on];W[ql];B[no];W[op];B[oq];W[np];B[or];W[mp];B[qr]
;W[qn];B[rq]C[Black has achieved a big victory in the war here, obtaining a huge corner.];W[hc]C[White is able to obtain sente with W66, this is White's only comfort.];B[fe];W[he];B[kg]LB[db:a]C[B69 is over-steady, Black should first make the knight's move at 'a', then handle the two stones on the right side. Not sure whether the steady play like B37, B39 and B69 is due to strong favorable consciousness or just Gueon Hyojin's style.

(;W[hg]LB[ec:a][ed:b][dc:c][fb:d]C[W70 is wrong sequence play, White should first make the diagonal's extension at 'a', exchanging B 'b', W 'c' and B 'd', this makes a big difference in thickness and thinness (see var a).];B[fg];W[ec];B[fb]LB[ed:a][dc:b]C[B73 is a mistake, Black must exchange B 'a' with W 'b'.]
(;W[hi]LB[jc:A][kb:B][fd:C][gd:D][ed:E][ge:F][gc:G][hd:H][id:I][ie:J]C[W74 is also a mistake, how come to miss this good opportunity? with the sequence from 'a' to 'j', White would make a considerable profit (see var a). In the game, after the exchange of W74 and B75, the exchange is not ideal any more, simply because White has used one extra move.];B[fi];W[eh];B[fh]

;B[jb];W[eb]LB[gb:A]C[W92: I make a mistake even in this small place, to play at 'a' is much better.];B[ip];W[fo];B[gp];W[fp];B[dn];W[in];B[kp];W[nm];B[kn];W[ho]
;B[hp];W[fm];B[dr];W[jo];B[jp];W[gk];B[gj];W[hj];B[fk];W[hk];B[jn]C[B113 is Gueon's style, steady! Now there are still a lot of big points on the board.];W[co];B[do]
;W[bm]C[W114: White must obtain territory.];B[cm];W[cq];B[dq];W[cl];B[dl];W[ck];B[fl];W[gl];B[em]LB[bn:a]C[B121, B123 and B125 again reflect the steady style, if it were me, I would play at 'a' with B121.];W[jm]

;W[bp];B[ln];W[ml]LB[lm:a]C[W142 is no good, White should attach back at 'a'.];B[bq]LB[ch:a]C[B143 is counter-sente endgame worth 8 points, but it is smaller than the invasion at 'a'.];W[aq];B[br];W[di]C[White is able to play at 146, the difference in territory between both sides has been narrowed down.];B[ll];W[lm]
;B[mn];W[nn];B[lk];W[jk]LB[mm:a]C[W152: White should connect at 'a' safely, I always have more questionable moves when entering into the middle and late game.];B[ob];W[pd];B[pb]
(;W[rg]LB[lq:a][kr:b][kq:c][jr:d][rn:e]C[The endgame play of W156 is wrong, White should make the diagonal's extension at 'a', then B 'b', W 'c', B 'd' and W 'e', this way the game would be a little to White's advantage (see var a).];B[pe];W[oe];B[dj];W[cj];B[sl];W[sm];B[rm]
;W[rn];B[sn];W[rl];B[ih];W[lh]LB[hh:a]C[W168 is a neutral point, connecting at 'a' has no risk at all. In byo-yomi, it will most clearly show a player's calculation ability.];B[sm];W[sk];B[so];W[lq];B[kr];W[kq];B[jr]
;W[hh]LB[re:a][sc:b]C[W176: White should play at 'a', next sliding with the knight's move at 'b', it is also a very good endgame.];B[ef];W[df];B[eg];W[dg];B[ei];W[jq];B[iq];W[lr]LB[dh:A]C[W184 is a gote 6-point endgame, however the point 'a' is a sente 6-point endgame, White has incurred a terrible loss.]
;B[dh];W[ci];B[ch];W[bh];B[rk];W[nr]LB[sd:a][ar:b]C[W190 is a 5-point gote move, however the knight's move at 'a' is a sente 5 point move. To crawl at 'b' is also a gote 6-point move.];B[rf];W[sf];B[re];W[hr];B[ir]
;W[fr]C[W194 and W196: White dies in gote, with this kind of second half game, how to win the game? In this game, White's questionable moves are too many, White's play is too coarse, need to think over and learn from mistakes.];B[ri];W[nq];B[ps];W[ks];B[gs];W[hs];B[fs];W[es];B[er];W[gr];B[fs];W[ar]
