;B[fe];W[dj];B[ae];W[ad];B[ag]C[Players are more and more interested in studying this joseki. In the semi-final, Huang Yizhong defeated Zhou Heyang by descenting at B35.];W[ab];B[ba];W[ac];B[af];W[bi]LB[ca:a]C[W40 cut is the right play. Zhou Heyang ataris at 'a', but in the postgame analysis, he also think it should cut at 40.];B[bj]C[The sequence from B35 to 41 becomes common understanding.]
;W[od]LB[gf:a]C[W42 tenuki aims to watch and see how Black responds. W42 can also consider attacking at 'a', this is also the move what Zhou Heyang told me.];B[fg];W[pf]LB[gi:a]C[W44 tenuki is a kind of momentum, but from the result, it's not good. It's better if W44 jumps at 'a'.];B[do];W[re]LB[gi:a]C[W46 tenuki again is like falling into devil's clutches! it overemphasizes the upper right corner, it should be at 'a' to keep balance.];B[gj]C[B47 is the pivotal point! The attack is very severe, White sinks into a hard fighting.];W[fk];B[gk]
;W[fm];B[gl];W[fp];B[fl]LB[fo:a][ep:b]C[But B53 is questionable, it should press at 'a' or make the diagonal move at 'b' to attack White as a whole, White is hard to handle.];W[dm]LB[fo:a]C[W54 jumping aims to sacrifice, Black suddenly realized it's not that big to capture six White's stones on the top, now it's certainly not good to come back and attach out at 'a'. Due to the addition of W54, B 'a' is not that severe as earlier.];B[ai];W[ca];B[fo];W[go]
;B[fn];W[gn];B[em];W[co]C[The sequence after W62 carries out the plan of sacrificing stones.];B[dn];W[cn];B[cm];W[dp];B[dl]C[Through the exchange to B67, as a whole, White avoided the severe attack by Black.];W[nq];B[qn];W[kp]LB[gp:a]C[W70 also indirectly protects the cut at 'a', White can be satisfied.]
;B[ob];W[pc];B[lc];W[qj];B[pr];W[pb];B[iq]LB[gp:a][hp:b][gq:c][fq:d][hq:e][ip:f][jq:g][ho:h]C[B77 surprised me! Black takes such a big risk! Within 30 seconds, I decided to kill. B77 should cut at 'a', then W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 'e', W 'f', B 77 and W 'g', B 'h' can cut and sacrifice, this way it's still a good game.]
;W[ip]C[W78 pressing is a strong move.];B[hp];W[io];B[kq];W[lq];B[jq];W[lr]C[Through W84, Black is hard to make life.];B[gp];W[fq];B[gr];W[fr];B[kr]
