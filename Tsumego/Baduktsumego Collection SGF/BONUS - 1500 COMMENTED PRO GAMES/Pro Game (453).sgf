Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[pd]C[In the game 4 of the 44th Judan best-of-5 final held on 4/13, Cho Chikun 9p defeated Yamashita Keigo by 2.5 points and successfully defended his title, this is also Cho Chikun's 69th champion. As to Cho Chikun who loves Go and never say retreat, his any achievement is not surprising. Yamashita Keigo is one of strongest players in Japan and he just won Kisei title, Cho Chikun can beat him by 3:1, this champion is indeed substantial.];W[dp];B[pq];W[dc];B[fq]

;W[oq];B[on];W[pp];B[oo];W[mq];B[de]LB[qf:a][cf:b]C[Although the sequence following B23 is joseki, Black ends in gote, White gets to reduce at 'a' on the right side, Black's tempo looks slow. With B23 for Black to play at 'a' to obtain sente is relatively better.];W[dg];B[fe];W[fc];B[cc];W[cb]
;B[cd];W[eb];B[cg];W[ch];B[dh];W[ci];B[eg];W[di];B[df];W[qf];B[re]C[B39: Black aims to utilize his power of thickness at the bottom.];W[nc]LB[rf:a]C[W40 turning the body around is a little hasty, White should block at 'a', to destroy Black's territory on the right side is urgent.]

;B[of];W[me];B[dm];W[cm];B[dk];W[fi]C[As to B71, with W72 for White to attach over is too weak, the counterattack in the real game is inevitable.];B[cl];W[el];B[ek];W[eh];B[fg];W[bg];B[bf]
;W[dg]C[White takes advantage very happily in sente with W76 and W80, this is also White's planned tactic when playing W72.];B[cf];W[en];B[fl];W[em];B[eo];W[dn];B[gj];W[gi];B[ij]LB[hj:a]C[B89: Although Black's speed is fast, Black is left with hidden trouble, to extend at 'a' is thick.];W[hh]
;B[ji];W[gf];B[mg]C[B93: Black's fighting spirit is high, but Black itself takes a big risk and needs certain courage to play this way.];W[oh];B[ph];W[oj];B[pi];W[lh];B[kg];W[lg];B[ig];W[jf];B[hf]
;W[ih];B[jg];W[ge];B[li];W[ki];B[lj];W[lf];B[gg]LB[gk:a]C[In this chaotic fight, Cho Chikun makes mistake, B111 is an overplay, he perhaps overlooks White's strong move at 'a'.];W[gk];B[hj]LB[kj:a]C[Following B113, White crosses over, Black clearly fails in the fight, with B111 Black should first play at 'a' to do some preparations.]

;B[gk];W[bm];B[mj];W[kh];B[lr]C[B131: Black can only enclose territory, now Black's situation is already not optimistic.];W[ff]LB[kl:a][lq:b]C[But afterwards, Yamashita's play is very questionable, for example, with W132 White should first jump to 'a' to exchange with B 'b', then play W132, this variation will be much better.];B[kl]C[The cap of B133 is alert! The center contains some uncertain factor.];W[jj];B[ii];W[lk]
;B[nk];W[kn];B[lq];W[jl];B[jm];W[il];B[km];W[im];B[jn];W[kk]LB[gn:a]C[W146 is not careful and precise enough, White should first jump to 'a', this way no matter how Black to connect, Black will be no better than the real game.];B[gn]C[B147: Black completely encloses the bottom, Black turns to be favorable for the game.]
;W[hg];B[bh];W[mr];B[mp];W[np];B[pr]C[B153 is the winning move! Black settles the shape beautifully.];W[qp];B[or];W[nq];B[mo];W[no];B[nn];W[op]
