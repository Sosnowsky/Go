Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[pd]C[This is the decisive game 3 of 1st Korean Sibdang Cup, before this, the series is tied at 1:1.];W[dd]C[Lee Changho takes White.];B[qp];W[dp];B[fq];W[hq]
;B[oq];W[cn];B[pj];W[kq];B[fc];W[cf];B[mc];W[hd];B[ge];W[gd]LB[he:a]C[W16 directly pushing and cutting is strong and unyielding, the common move is to attach at 'a'.];B[ee]LB[fd:a][fe:b][dc:c][cc:d][ff:e][ed:f]C[Black's answer following B17 is questionable, with B17 Black should block at 'a', next W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B17, W 'e' and B 'f', this way White has no assurance of success in the fight.]
;W[fe];B[ff]LB[ed:a][dc:b][fd:c]C[B19 playing atari first is necessary. If Black first attaches at 'a', White will descend at 'b'. Moreover, if Black cuts at 'c', next W19, B 'b' and W 'a', this variation is different from the above one.];W[fd];B[ed];W[ec];B[dc];W[eb];B[de];W[cd];B[ce]
;W[be];B[bd];W[cc];B[bf];W[ef];B[ae];W[df];B[be];W[bc];B[cg];W[fg];B[gf];W[eg]
;B[ci]C[After the cut of W22, the sequence up to B41 is one-way street. White is relatively beneficial.];W[ck]LB[hg:a]C[W42: For White to capture three stones at 'a' already can be satisfied.];B[ie];W[id];B[dj];W[if];B[ig];W[he];B[hf];W[je];B[gh]
;W[pp]LB[fi:a][gi:b]C[W52 aims to serve as ladder breaker but is a miscalculation. If White jumps to 'a', Black has the good move of attaching at 'b', this completely has nothing to do with ladder breaker. However after White sacrifices five stones, White's situation is not falling behind.];B[pq];W[qc]C[W54: White strikes at 3-3 to seek a way to continue.];B[qd];W[pc];B[oc];W[jg];B[ih];W[ob];B[nb]
;W[od];B[nc];W[rd];B[re];W[rb];B[sd];W[sc]LB[fi:a]C[W68: White immediately starts the ko, it is too direct. White can consider to jump at 'a', first creating more severe ko threats.];B[rc];W[fi];B[sb]C[B71 eliminating the ko is very big. Although White escapes five stones, White also takes some risk.];W[gi]
;B[jh];W[kg];B[kh]LB[dk:a]C[B75: Black can consider to press at 'a'.];W[dk];B[ej];W[gk];B[ek];W[cj]C[W80 is a local good move, Black is a little painful.];B[bh]C[After B81, Black's four stones in the center is still inside White's mouth.];W[lh];B[li]
;W[mi];B[lj];W[mj];B[mk]LB[mh:a]C[The hane of B87 is also a little impulsive, Black should first play atari at 'a', this way Black can completely seal off White.];W[mh];B[lk];W[nk];B[nl];W[ok]C[W90 and W92: White gets to stick the head out.];B[gg];W[el]
;B[fl];W[fk];B[bj];W[bk];B[ak];W[al];B[aj];W[bm];B[em];W[dl];B[fh];W[ei];B[eh]LB[dq:a]C[B107 again is questionable. Black should attach at 'a', and handle B5 one stone. Black already benefits from the exchange of B105 and W106.]
;W[gp]C[W108 is a strong move, White wants to capture the whole black group. Since Black makes several mistakes, now Black is already difficult.];B[jq]C[Black's dodging sequence following B109 seems very far-fetched. However, only if Black plays this way, Black may have a chance to win.];W[jr];B[ir];W[iq];B[jp];W[lr];B[di];W[gn];B[hr];W[gr];B[gq]
;W[is];B[hp];W[hs];B[go];W[ho];B[fp];W[in]C[W124 and W126 again are strong moves, but it seems White is also very dangerous.];B[dq];W[cq];B[do];W[cp];B[fm]LB[hm:a][hn:b]C[B131 is the last losing move. Black should first strike at 'a', if White connects at 'b', then B131, this way White is also dangerous in the capturing race.]
;W[hl]C[After W132, Black is completely hopeless, White captures all black stones and wins the game for sure.];B[dm];W[cm];B[bl];W[cl];B[ip];W[ko];B[jo];W[jn];B[kn];W[kp];B[hm];W[il]
