Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[pd]C[Recently Shao Weigang advanced to the final of Ahan Tongshan Cup, he is in a very good state.];W[dd];B[qp];W[dp];B[oq]C[The star and worry-free corner opening of B1, B3 and B5 is often used by Shao Weigang recently.]
;W[qj];B[fc];W[cf];B[qg];W[qm];B[jd];W[hc];B[pj]C[When White invades with W12, the attachment of B13 is one variation, first watching how White will respond on the right side, then deciding how to play at the top.];W[pi];B[qi]LB[qk:a]C[As to the hane of W14, if Black hanes at 'a', it will lead to a chaotic fight.];W[qk]

;W[ol]C[The game proceeds steadily, through W30, the situation is about even.];B[oj]LB[oh:a]C[B31 is heavy, Black should capture in a ladder by playing at 'a' instead, so far White doesn't have any tactic of playing a proper ladder breaker at the top.];W[jf];B[cn];W[dk]C[Shao Weigang likes territory and his strength is big, therefore I decides to play W32 and W34, dealing him with these relatively "free-spirited" moves.];B[en];W[fq];B[gp];W[fp]LB[gq:a]C[W38: White can also elect to crawl at 'a' to take territory.]
;B[gn];W[dm];B[dn];W[gk]LB[cq:a]C[In the game, through W42, I continue to carry on my early plan, but B 'a' entering the corner is to my surprise.];B[cq];W[cp];B[bp];W[bo];B[bq]
(;W[bn]LB[co:a][ao:b][dq:c][eq:d][dr:e][hq:f]C[W48: White should connect at 'a', next B48, W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 'd' and W 'f', this way comparing with the real game, Black's corner territory and White's territory on the left side are all relatively reduced, it is about equal, but Black doesn't connect together in the center, Black would be much thinner, it is better for White to expand territory at the top (see var a).];B[co];W[cm];B[dq];W[fo];B[fn];W[iq]
;B[ep];W[pg];B[pf];W[og]LB[le:a][mc:b]TR[oj]C[W56 and W58 are the tactic I'm aiming at all the time, it is also the punishment to the improperness of B31 (the marked stone), but after the game, I feel that White should first make the knight's move at 'a', if Black reinforces the defect on the right side, next White's knight's move at 'b' is extremely big, if Black plays at the top, White can pull out at 56, this would be more severe.];B[mf];W[of];B[pe];W[mg];B[kf]C[After W58, it is time for noon break, after the game resumes in the afternoon, Shao Weigang arrived at the game room 20 minutes earlier than me, and in fact he did come out with some good moves, from B59 to B63.]
;W[lg]LB[kg:a]C[White has no other choice but to play W64, if White hanes at 'a', Black will wedge at 64, White couldn't look after his thinness both on the left and right side.];B[jg];W[if];B[ng]LB[lf:a]C[Originally White is already difficult to handle, but B67 is a bad move! Black should connect at 'a'.];W[nh];B[nf];W[lf];B[oe]C[In the game, Black captures five black stones with B71,  which is too small, White gets a chance to win the game at one stroke.];W[ld]LB[ke:a][go:b]C[Unfortunately, White also plays a bad move W72. White should simply atari at 'a', Black has to destroy territory in the upper left corner, White can push at 'b', which also serves as the ladder breaker of White's five stones, this way White will be favorable.]
;B[ke]C[W72: Because of White's greediness, Black gets to play the game-deciding move of B73, but if White answers correctly, the game is still to White's advantage.];W[le];B[kg];W[kd];B[hg];W[ig];B[ih];W[jh]LB[hh:a]C[The cut of W80 is a regrettable losing move, the correct move is to cut at 'a'.];B[kh];W[ji];B[je]
;W[hd];B[jc];W[mi];B[oh];W[lj];B[lb]C[In the real game, a series of tactics from B81 to B89 is surprisingly severe! During the time, I thought several times to connect left and right sides at the top, but instead I elected more and more chaotic play, the situation has been turned around with these several moves.];W[mc];B[mb];W[oc];B[nc];W[nd];B[nb];W[ij]
;B[kj];W[kk];B[ki];W[jk];B[lk];W[mk];B[ll];W[ml];B[hh];W[fe];B[lm];W[mm];B[jj]
;W[ii];B[ik];W[hj];B[om];W[ok];B[jl];W[nn];B[nj];W[mj];B[mo];W[on];B[ir]C[Next Black starts to attack White instead, forcing White to live painfully on the right side, B121 attaching on the second line is a fatal attack.];W[jr]
;B[hr];W[kq];B[ip];W[jp];B[hp];W[mq];B[lp];W[or];B[pr];W[in];B[ko];W[jo];B[hn]C[Afterwards, I had spent a lot of time to find a way to make life, but unfortunately I failed in the end. In fact, even if White is able to make life painfully, White can't allow Black to find any loophole in the upper left corner,  after White fails in the fight at the top, Black is already in an invincible situation.]
