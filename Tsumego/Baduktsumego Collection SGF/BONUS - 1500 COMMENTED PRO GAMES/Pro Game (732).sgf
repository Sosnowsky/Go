;W[pd];B[qe];W[qb];B[np]C[Up to the knight's move of B21, Black's tempo is fast.];W[fq]LB[iq:a][kq:b][qq:c][qr:d][pp:e][oq:f]C[W22: For White to playing at 'a' is better, if Black forces at 'b', White can attach at 'c', next B 'd', W 'e', B 'f' and W22.];B[hq]C[In the game, the position of the one-space tight pincer of B23 is very ideal.]
;W[cn];B[fp];W[cq];B[dq];W[cp];B[do];W[cr];B[dr];W[lq];B[qm]LB[qq:a][qr:b][pp:c][rq:d]C[When White invades with W32, the invasion of B33 is also good timing! If White attaches at 'a', then B 'b', W 'c' and B 'd'.]

;W[oj];B[kj];W[jl];B[pi];W[ph]LB[oi:a]C[The attachment of W76 is a good move, if White presses out at 'a', Black will retreat at 76, White is not alive as a whole.];B[oi];W[ri];B[qh];W[sl];B[pl];W[pk];B[ol]
;W[rb];B[pg]LB[ni:a][jn:b]C[B85: Black should strengthen at 'a', later on Black's extension at 'b' is basically sente.];W[cj];B[fe];W[hc]LB[lc:a][ic:b]TR[md]C[White first invades with W88 then strikes at 'a', making Black very easy to play at 'b', White on the right is already very thick, capturing the marked black stone is not that effective. With W88, White should directly strike at 'a'.];B[hd];W[lc]
;B[ic];W[ld];B[jo];W[jr];B[hs];W[ko];B[cl];W[bn];B[ch];W[em]LB[dk:a]C[The knight's move of W100 is a questionable move, White should make the diagonal extension at 'a'.];B[bf];W[be]
;B[df];W[ce];B[el];W[ej]C[When Black attaches with B105, White jumps with W106, White's tempo is a little messy.];B[fl];W[dg];B[dh];W[eh];B[ei];W[di];B[eg];W[fi];B[cg]C[An exchange has resulted with the sequence from W108 to B115, Black is a little favorable.]

;W[bi]TR[bj][cl]C[W178: White doesn't have a proper ko threat, capturing the marked two black stones in also not small, it is a game-deciding move.
];B[da];W[ge];B[ci];W[bk];B[ff]LB[gg:a][cb:b]C[The original move of B183 is to turn at 'a', White retreats at 'b', Black's territory is inadequate.];W[gd];B[cb];W[hf]

;B[gf];W[he];B[kf];W[eh];B[sj];W[si];B[ei];W[gj]LB[eh:a]C[W206 is the last losing move. White should directly play at 'a' to fight a ko with Black, in the game although it also tights the ko, but after Black separates White's big group, Black has abundant ko threats.];B[jg];W[lg];B[lf];W[lh]
