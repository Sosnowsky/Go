Translation:GoGameWorld.];B[pd]C[In the title match 1 of the 18th Tianyuan title, the challenger Xie He 5p took Black and played first. This kind of opening goes back to the early model that was frequently used.];W[dd];B[qp];W[dq];B[oq]
;W[ck]LB[qj:a]C[W6: White elects for both sides to expand their own moyo, playing the split move at 'a' is the most common.];B[pj];W[jp];B[do]C[After Black all connects together with B7, the extension of W8 is pre-planned, Black immediately approaches the corner with B9,  in the opening stage, the game enters into a fight, showing young players' vigor and fighting spirit.];W[fp];B[cq];W[cr];B[cp];W[cn]LB[br:a]C[W14: White can also extend at 'a' to get into the corner.]
;B[dn];W[cm];B[fo];W[go];B[gn];W[fn];B[fm];W[eo];B[en];W[fo];B[el];W[ej]C[The sequence up to W26 is the normal proceeding from both sides.];B[hn]
;W[ho];B[br]LB[gl:a]C[But next Black suddenly releases some questionable moves! B27 and B29 should be reserved, in the game the aji completely disappears, and also later on White is left with the severe peep at 'a', Black's whole dragon will come under White's fierce attack.];W[dr];B[cf];W[ch];B[di]C[As to pincer of W32, both sides are not willing to fall behind with the sequence following B33.];W[eh];B[ci];W[dh];B[bh]C[However, Black can play hane at 37 in sente and should have nothing to complain.];W[ei]
;B[bj];W[dj];B[cd];W[cc];B[ce];W[bc];B[ef]LB[ed:a][de:b][dc:c]C[But the question is, B45 and B47 are very bad moves! It seems Black should pincer at 'a', then W 'b' and B 'c', this way Black can stick his head out by sacrificing.];W[ed]C[In the game, after White doubles up at the vital point with W46, Black isn't smooth to stick the head out.];B[ff]LB[gf:a]C[At any rate, the play of B47 can't be considered! Black certainly should jump out 'a', although Black would be left with the defect of wedge and cut, but Black must jump out. Black's two groups are not alive, Black's situation is already not good, however the problem is, Black's bad moves are still yet to come!]

;B[rb];W[qg];B[pf];W[og];B[of];W[nf]C[On the right side, the sequence from W50 to W66 is common shape.];B[pg]LB[rh:a]C[But the push of B67 is a very bad move! After White hangs at 'a', Black already has no any follow-up maneuver.];W[ph];B[oe];W[rh];B[jc]
;W[ae];B[af];W[ib];B[lq]LB[hl:a][bk:b][he:c]C[B75 is a play under an inferior situation, the original move is to strengthen at 'a', next W 'b' and B 'c', this is the pace of playing.];W[np];B[op]LB[lo:a]C[B77 is the last losing move! Here Black can only counterattack by jumping out at 'a', only if Black counterattacks, Black's big dragon wouldn't come under attack.];W[gl]LB[mo:a]C[The attack of W78 is severe, because White gets the diagonal sente move at 'a' unconditionally, White already has nothing to worry.]
;B[gm];W[hl];B[im];W[jk];B[km];W[jn];B[il];W[ik];B[kl];W[mo];B[mq];W[ok]C[The two-pronged attack of W90 is beautiful!  So far, the game loses balance, the following sequence is completely White's own show, finally Black's territory is not adequate and his big dragon gets killed tragically in the end.];B[qi]
