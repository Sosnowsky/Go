(;SZ[19]EV[China-Japan Friendship Match]DT[1974-12-09]PB[Nie Weiping]PW[Miyamoto Naoki]WR[9p]RE[B+4]PC[Shanghai, China]KM[5]C[Copyright by gogameworld.com and weiqi.tom.com.];B[pd]C[Most unforgettable game: this was the first time I played with a Japanese 9p and I claimed the victory, so I would never forget this game in my life.];W[dc];B[dp]C[Considering that my opponent is a high-rank 9p player, it is difficult to win the game if playing a steady opening, so I adopts the two-opposite corner opening which is more offense-oriented.];W[qp];B[ce];W[nq]
;B[fd]C[B7: Black elects to play the complicated "Great Slant" joseki, it is a pre-planned move after selecting the two-opposite corner opening, a fierce fight thus commences.];W[de];B[dd];W[ed];B[cd];W[ec];B[ee];W[df];B[cc]C[After I have blocked with B15 ...];W[eb]C[I'm shocked by the unexpected and weird move of W16.];B[cb];W[hc]
;B[bg];W[dh];B[fe];W[fg];B[he]C[The sequence up to B23 is inevitable for both sides.];W[jc]C[W24 seems a solid move, but ...];B[lc]LB[ib:a][kc:b]C[After being checked by B25, White has no good follow-ups, later on, White can still strike at 'a', then White would be very painful. After the game, Miyamoto said regretfully: after being checked by B15, White's situation has suddenly deteriorated! At any rate, White should make the two-space extension at 'b', although White's shape is a little thin, but White has no other alternative, afterwards White can look for a chance to strengthen with one more move. So, the earlier novel play of W16 seems questionable.];W[hg];B[je];W[kd]
;B[kf];W[ld];B[mc];W[md];B[nc];W[mf];B[ih]LB[ig:a][kh:b]C[B35 is a tricky move, enticing White to push at 'a', then Black can go with the flow and reinforce at 'b'.];W[kh]C[White sees through Black's trick and takes the vital point first, W36 is a good move!];B[ig];W[dk]
;B[gq];W[ij];B[gh]C[B41: Black wants to make life on the spot, B41 is the best play to settle Black himself.];W[gj];B[ib]C[B43 is excellent timing.];W[hb];B[jb];W[ic];B[gg]LB[kc:a]C[B47: Black has strengthened for making life, afterwards, the squeezing move at 'a' is sente, White at the top is still not safe.];W[mh]C[W48: So White has to reinforce, now Black is favorable for the game.]
;B[pj]LB[qj:a]C[B49 is careless, it almost costs Black the game. Black certainly should extend one line lower at 'a'.];W[qh];B[ng];W[lf];B[qe];W[pl];B[kp];W[pg];B[pn]C[The invasion of B57 is a good skip tesuji.];W[ql]C[W58: White decisively cuts Black's connection, it is a strong move.];B[no]C[B59: Black forces White to reinforce the corner.]
;W[op];B[qo];W[rp];B[nl]C[Black then reduces White's moyo with B61 and B63 smoothly.];W[lo];B[ol];W[nj];B[rj];W[pk];B[ok];W[qj];B[mp]C[B71: Black holds still and waits to see White's action.]
;W[ff]C[W72: White has seen there are no good maneuvers to deal with Black in the lower right, so he turns to attack the center black stones.];B[gf];W[hi];B[fh];W[eh];B[fj];W[fk];B[kg];W[oj]LB[qi:A]C[W80: White reinforces to avoid the ko fight if Black plays at 'a', it also secretly prepares to kill Black's dragon in the center, but over here, Miyamoto 9p has obviously miscalculated.];B[mq]C[After Black solidifies with B81, the territory difference between two sides becomes very big, if White can not kill the center black stones, White can not redeem his defeat, but Black has a good move to settle himself.];W[hh]C[W82: White starts the attack.]
;B[ef]C[The moves after B83 starts to reduce White's liberties.];W[eg];B[dg];W[cg];B[cf];W[dg];B[dj]C[B89 is the only clever move to get out of trouble, it is also the prepared move while playing B81.];W[fi];B[ej]C[When While ataris at W90, the simple connection of B91 is a very ingenuous move! Miyamoto 9p starts to ponder, apparently he has overlooked Black's counter-attack with B91.];W[ci]C[The sequence after W92 is the best possible moves for both sides, White's attack has totally failed in the end.];B[cj]

Before this game, Mr. Miyamoto, the captain of the Japanese delegation, has won all his six games, in this situation, finally I can grab one point from Miyamoto 9p, this is another important point of this game.];W[qc];B[pc];W[io];B[hp];W[mm];B[nn];W[nr];B[mr];W[fp];B[ho];W[re]
