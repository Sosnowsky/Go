;B[kc]C[B7 is a very popular play among Korean players.];W[qn]LB[po:a]C[W8 is common. The recent trend is to high-approach at 'a' or play the splitting move. With the large knight's approach in the real game, White perhaps wants to disrupt Black's plan.];B[ql];W[qq];B[qp];W[pp];B[rq];W[qr];B[po];W[op];B[qo]
;W[oo];B[pn];W[on]C[The play of W18 and W20 is very rare, this is the first time I see these moves, by joseki White will turn at 2-2, it seems the play in the game is relatively crude, the result wouldn't be good.];B[om];W[nm];B[ol];W[od];B[pf];W[qc];B[rc];W[of];B[og];W[rd]
;B[pc];W[qe];B[qb];W[pd];B[nf];W[ne]C[W36: White should first take the ko. In the real game, after exchange, White takes, which is really hard to understand.];B[me]C[In the upper-right corner, White makes several miscalculations and overlooks the strong move of B37, afterwards White sinks into a bitter battle. After the shape is settled in the upper-right corner, the game is already over.];W[qc];B[or];W[oq];B[qd];W[md]
;B[oe];W[qc];B[nd]C[W44: White should connect at 45, in the real game Black is very happy.];W[nc];B[qd];W[ne];B[ld];W[qc];B[nr];W[pr];B[qd];W[le];B[nd]

;B[jc];W[sf];B[pg];W[nb]C[Through W72, although White makes life, Black becomes very thick, White incurs a big loss.];B[lq]C[After Black plays B73, Black takes initiative and is thick, can't see White can't get any territory here.];W[mn];B[iq];W[nl];B[nk];W[mk];B[mj];W[pm]
;B[pl];W[nj];B[ok];W[lj];B[mi];W[gq];B[oc];W[nd];B[lk];W[ml];B[kj];W[sh]C[W92 is a play to mess up the situation in an unfavorable situation, if Black retreats one step, Black is still clearly favorable.];B[si]

;B[ma];W[fh];B[fg];W[eg];B[ef];W[ff]C[Overall in this game, Luo Xihe's play is too hasty, from W18, W20 to the upper-right corner, White quickly collapses.];B[gf]C[The semi final game 3 will take place on 12/16.])
