Translation:GoGameWorld.];B[pd]C[In this Nong Shim Cup Ring Contest, Japanese player Cho U 9p defeated Yu Bin 9p and Heo Youngho 2p consecutively, Cho U is also regarded as the strongest player in the Japanese Team, therefore, this game is considered as a very important game.];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[fq]
;W[ip];B[dn];W[fp];B[cq]C[The play of B7 and B9 is a "flying knife" that comes from our recent study in Qingfeng Study Group. In this kind of fast game, if you are familiar with a new variation, you definitely will have some advantage. After the game, Wang Lei said jokingly that this "flying knife" can only be used once.];W[cp];B[gp];W[ep];B[hp];W[er];B[iq];W[po];B[oo];W[qq]
;B[pp];W[qp];B[on];W[qn];B[br];W[gq];B[bp];W[gr];B[hq];W[fn]LB[bo:a][co:b]C[W28: White can't hane underneath at 'a', because Black may cut at 'b', no matter how to proceed, White is always no good.];B[cn]C[Through B29, the local exchange comes an end, in the study room players all think that Black's advantage is clear.]
;W[op];B[oq]LB[np:a][pr:b][nr:c][mr:d]C[After the cut of W30, the atari of B31 is typical of Wei Lei's fight-oriented style. Yu Bin 9p thinks that Black should atari at 'a', then W31, B 'b', W 'c' and Black sacrifices several stones by playing at 'd', the variation is simple and it is to Black's advantage. The play in the game leads to a fierce fight.];W[np];B[nq];W[mp];B[lr];W[kp]LB[lp:a]C[After the jump of B36, White's shape is no good, White should extend at 'a', Black is a little painful.]

;W[gl];B[jl];W[ml];B[gm];W[hs]LB[fl:a][fm:b]C[Before White makes life with W54, White should exchange W 'a' and B 'd' to take some advantage.];B[fl];W[gj];B[io];W[jo];B[jp];W[jn]
;B[hj];W[fk];B[gi];W[el];B[fm];W[ej];B[ik];W[gk];B[eh]C[Through B69, Black is sailing smoothly and Black's advantage is obvious.];W[ci];B[ch];W[bh];B[di]C[B73 is a mistake!]
;W[cg];B[dj];W[dk]LB[dh:a][ei:b][ck:c][cl:d][bk:e]C[W76: Wang Lei thought White would take at 'a', then B 'b', W76, B 'c' and W 'd', then Black can clamp at 'e' to separate White, but he didn't expect White would first hang at 76, then take at 78, locally Black has incurred a big loss (It is said that Wang Lei was suddenly drenched with sweat at that time)!];B[cj];W[dh];B[dg];W[ch];B[ei]
;W[bj];B[df];W[hi]LB[cd:a]C[W84: But next White has also made mistakes. White should double up at 'a' to connect back White's big group, this way White's situation is not bad. In the game, White cuts strongly a thick group, the situation again becomes chaotic.];B[gh];W[ii];B[ck];W[cl];B[lk];W[mk];B[li];W[ig];B[ce]
;W[cd]C[W94 is a miscalculation.];B[bf]LB[bk:a]C[B95: Black should first push at 'a', White would die, although White can separate Black in the middle, but White would fail in the capturing race.];W[bk]C[But Black didn't catch the opportunity, White quickly strengthens with W96.];B[hg]C[B97: Black guards against the cut in the center.];W[bd]C[After White reinforces to make life with W98, the road to the victory/defeat is again far away. However, both sides has already entered into the overtime, making some mistakes is also very normal.];B[pi];W[jh];B[ll];W[mj];B[lj]
;W[pj];B[oj]LB[qj:a]C[B105: Black should directly hane at 'a', White has no good follow-up maneuver.];W[ok];B[qj];W[pk];B[qk];W[oi];B[pn];W[he]LB[mm:a][nj:b]C[Next, with the attack of W112 White ends in gote, if White directly takes one black stone at 'b', the outcome of the game would be still anybody's guess.]
