;W[od];B[cq];W[de];B[oc]C[In the opening, with two corner attachments of B7 and B9, Black is slightly favorable in territory.];W[nc];B[pc];W[nd];B[qf];W[bq];B[dq];W[bo];B[iq];W[jd]
;B[dm]C[B19 is the vital point for moyo's expansion and reduction of both sides.];W[cn];B[dn];W[nq];B[np];W[op]LB[mp:a][oq:b]C[W24: If White plays hane at 'a', then Black will hang at 'b' to protect the corner. However the wedge of W24 in the game is a little farfetched.];B[oo];W[oq];B[pq];W[po]
;B[qo];W[pn];B[mp]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.];W[qn]
(;B[mq]LB[rp:a][no:b][on:c][mo:d][lo:e][om:f][nn:g][mn:h][nm:i][ln:j][km:k]C[B33 is simple and clear, making the tiger's move at 'a' would be more powerful, followed by W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 'e', W 'f', B 'g', W 'h', B 'i' and W 'j', next B 'k' is the typical good move which uses one stone to break two ladders (see var a).];W[ro];B[rq]
;W[qh]C[In the game, White is able to atari with W34 and extend with W36, basically "turning his body around".];B[nn];W[nl];B[lb]C[The play of B39 is good timing.];W[mb];B[lc];W[ic]C[White can't allow Black to cross over or fly out at 42, otherwise White's territory would be inadequate.];B[le]C[However, Black gets to jump out with B43, also achieving his goal.];W[pe];B[qe];W[og]
;B[kf];W[if];B[kh];W[lg]C[After this move, the game was closed for the first day.];B[jf];W[ig];B[jh];W[hi];B[mi];W[oi];B[mk];W[nj];B[mj]
;W[ch];B[ei]LB[hk:a]C[The play of B61 is good judgement, if Black elects to cap at 'a' to fight a territory race, Black doesn't have assurance of success.];W[hk];B[eg];W[fh];B[eh]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.];W[cf];B[ci];W[cj]LB[hm:a]C[The clamp of W68 is the first step leading to White's defeat, now jumping at 'a' is imperative!]
;B[bi]C[With the sequence following B69, Black obtains sente by sacrificing.];W[dj];B[ej];W[di];B[cg];W[bg];B[bh];W[dg];B[dh];W[cg];B[bk];W[bj];B[dk]
;W[ah];B[nk];W[ok];B[ol];W[pl];B[hm]C[The cap of B87 shows Hane Naoki's good ability in taking the situation as a whole into consideration.];W[il];B[im];W[kl];B[ml];W[fk]LB[jm:a][gj:b]C[W92: White should simply hang at 'a', White overlooks Black's counterattack tactic at 'b'.]
;B[gj];W[fj];B[fi];W[gi];B[fl]C[After being hit by B97, Black clearly has incurred a loss.];W[jm];B[jk];W[jl];B[ek];W[gk];B[br];W[ar];B[bs]LB[cr:a][bm:b][jn:c]C[B105 at 'a' is simpler, White can only make the diagonal extension at 'b' to make life, next Black plays hane at 'c', this way Black is slightly better for the game.]
;W[do]LB[eo:a][dp:b][eq:c]C[The tiger's move of W106 is the game-deciding move, if Black blocks at 'a', White can make life at 'b', this way White is left with the aji of cutting at 'c'.];B[bm]C[In the game, Black jumps with B107 to kill, the outcome of the game comes down to this single action!];W[eo];B[bn];W[fo];B[gp];W[hp];B[gq];W[go]
;B[fm];W[io];B[jn];W[hq];B[gr];W[hr]C[The block of W120 is usually sente, but now Black's shape in the lower left is "Knife Five", which is able to fight a capturing race with White, White's liberties are not enough.];B[jq]LB[kq:a][ns:b][is:c]C[B121: For Black to jump at 'a' is simpler, fortunately Black has a clever move at 'b'! Because White's diagonal move at 'c' is sente, there will be a loophole at the bottom.];W[kq];B[kr]
