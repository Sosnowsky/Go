;W[po]LB[fd:a][ed:b]C[W8: If White directly presses at 'a', then Black will play the wedge at 'b', White is not favorable in the ladder.];B[qm];W[np];B[qo];W[pn];B[qn];W[pp];B[qp];W[oq];B[pr];W[fd]
;B[do];W[dl];B[eq]LB[fo:a][fq:b][ho:c]C[B21: For Black to jump at 'a' is simple and clear, followed by W 'b' and B 'c', this way Black can reduce White's influence on the right side.];W[ep];B[dp];W[fq];B[er];W[cq];B[fr];W[eo]
;B[en];W[gq];B[dr]LB[hq:a][fo:b][gp:c]C[B31: Black can also bump at 'a', White can only answer at 'b', then Black plays hane at 'c', this would lead to another game.];W[dn];B[cn];W[dm];B[bp];W[go]C[After the sequence from B31 to W36, it forms a position of Black's territory vs. White's outside influence.];B[hp]C[B37 is unnecessary.]
;W[gp];B[cc];W[ec];B[be]C[B39: Black continues to grab territory, up to B41, Black takes all four corners.];W[ol]C[The knight's move of W42 is the vital point.];B[cg];W[dh];B[ch];W[di];B[lk]C[B47 is a good point for reduction.];W[ne]C[W48: White doesn't have any proper point to attack B47, so White elects to cap with W48 first.]
;B[jk]C[After the jump of B49, White is difficult to cultivate the center.
];W[bq];B[cp];W[ap];B[bn];W[cr];B[bs];W[cs];B[ds];W[ar]C[The sequence from B51 to W58 is inevitable.];B[gr]LB[hr:a]C[B59: If Black didn't play B37 earlier on, then White can't hane at 'a', so the play of B37 is not proper.]
;W[hr];B[ir];W[hq];B[hs];W[iq];B[jr];W[kq];B[kr];W[lq];B[lr];W[mr];B[jq];W[jp]
;B[jo];W[ko];B[nr]C[With the sequence from B61 to B75, although Black gains some territory, but White's outside becomes very thick, Black is no good.];W[bm];B[ao]C[After W76 and B77, the lower left corner is a two-step ko.];W[kj];B[kk];W[nj]LB[mc:a]C[W80: White starts to attack Black in the center, but its timing is too early. With W80, White should attach at 'a', then attack Black depending on the situation.];B[mi];W[lj]C[The knight's move of B81 and the push of W82 are all imperative.]
;B[mj];W[mk];B[ip];W[kp];B[jj];W[lh];B[jh];W[li];B[jf]C[After the turn of B87, Black simply jumps with B89 and B91, White is hard to attack efficiently.];W[mc]C[White attaches now with W92, it is already late.];B[mb];W[md]
;B[pc];W[lb];B[gk]C[B97: Black takes tenuki and plays one more move in the center, White sinks into a difficult situation.];W[hj];B[hk];W[hh]C[White continues to attack with W98 and W100, but at any rate it is one step slow.];B[fi]C[The knight's move of B101 is a good move.];W[gj];B[fj];W[gh]C[White has no other good maneuver but to play W102 and W104.];B[fm]
;W[fn];B[em]C[With B105 and B107, Black separates White in sente.];W[hn];B[fh]C[B109 is strong counterattack.];W[fs];B[gs];W[il];B[ik];W[fk]C[White has no other good choice but to cut with W114.];B[ek];W[fl];B[gf]
;W[hf];B[el];W[gl];B[gm];W[hl];B[hm];W[im];B[gn];W[ho];B[fo];W[gg];B[fp];W[jn]
;B[ef];W[ff];B[fg];W[fe]C[With the sequence from B115 to W134, it forms a big exchange, Black obtains sente, the game is still to Black's advantage.];B[ni]LB[nk:a]C[B135: If Black ataris at 'a', Black's advantage would be even bigger.];W[oj];B[oi];W[pj];B[mf];W[mg];B[lg]C[The squeezing move of B141 is miscalculation, White gives away one stone and clearly incurs loss.]
;W[lf];B[nk];W[ml]C[The exchange of B143 and W144 is better not to be played.];B[nf];W[kg];B[pi];W[qj];B[qi]C[Up to the block of B149, Black is still favorable for the game.];W[oe];B[eb];W[fb];B[dc]
;W[ed];B[ng];W[me];B[pf];W[eg];B[dg];W[eh];B[de];W[ej];B[dj];W[ob]C[W164: White elects not to capture four black stones but strike in the corner instead, it is the right choice.];B[fa];W[gb]
;B[ci];W[ri];B[rh];W[pe];B[qe];W[rj];B[oc]LB[pb:a][oa:b]C[B173: Black should block at 'a', when White plays at 173, Black can take sente by playing hane at 'b'.];W[nb];B[qg]LB[rg:a][sh:b][pg:c][qf:d]C[B175 is miscalculation, here there is no loop hole, if White clamps at 'a', then B 'b', W 'c' and B 'd', White has no enough liberties.]
;W[qb]C[With the jump of W176, the situation has been turned around. If it were not the mistake of B173 and B175, White couldn't get to play W176.];B[pb];W[pa];B[rb];W[ra];B[qc];W[qa];B[mh];W[lg];B[nq];W[rc]C[The atari of W186 is a ten-point endgame.];B[or]
;W[cd];B[bd];W[mq];B[op];W[no];B[rd];W[sb];B[pl];W[rl]LB[db:a]C[With B195, for Black to connect at 'a' is better, with the exchange of B195 and W196, Black's loss outweighs his gain.];B[om];W[nm];B[db]
;W[so];B[pm];W[on];B[ro];W[sn];B[sp];W[rm];B[pk];W[ok];B[ms];W[of];B[og];W[ce]

;B[df];W[ql];B[sq];W[oo];B[oq];W[nd];B[rg];W[od];B[sf]C[In this game, Black made several mistakes in almost-sure-win situation, but it can't be denied that White was very calm in an unfavorable situation, showing a very good psychological quality.
