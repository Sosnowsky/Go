;B[nb];W[of]LB[nc:a][ob:b][ph:c]C[Lee Changho had conducted a profound research on the one-space pincer. As to the jump of B19, in the past, W20 was used to be played at 'a', then White blocks at 'b', and Black jumps out at 'c', White's outside stones will come under attack, Black can fight. In the game, White elects to vary with W20 and W22.];B[pe];W[pg];B[re]LB[rc:a]C[B23: If Black hanes at 'a', Black can kill White's corner by reducing liberties.];W[rc]C[The descent of W24 is a strong move, this is Lee Changho's study result.];B[qg];W[qh]
;B[ph];W[og];B[rh];W[qi];B[rg]LB[ri:a][qf:b]C[B31: If Black crawls at 'a', White will atari at 'b', White already lives in sente.];W[ob];B[pi]TR[qh][qi]LB[nc:a]C[After the press of B33, in terms of the outcome, White is more favorable: first due to the addition of the two marked stones, White can use it for other purposes, second, White doesn't need to push at 'a' any more, the difference is huge.]
;W[lf];B[jc]C[B35: Black perhaps should extend at 'a' lightly.]LB[ic:a];W[gc];B[je];W[jf];B[if];W[ke];B[jg];W[kf]C[After White tolerates by connecting with W42, Black is surprisingly no good.];B[id];W[ig]LB[kc:a]C[W44: White should first attach at 'a', this would be better than the real game.]
;B[hf];W[kc];B[kb];W[kd];B[lb]LB[ih:a]C[B49: Black certainly should kill White's one stone in the ladder by playing at 'a'.];W[ib];B[jb];W[jh];B[hg];W[ih];B[pj]LB[jq:a][kq:b]C[B55 is slow! Black should force at 'a'. In the game, White easily makes a two-space extension at 'b', Black at the top is still under attack, it is already not easy for Black to win this game.]
;W[kq];B[cq];W[dq];B[cp];W[do];B[co]C[With the crawl of B61, Black aims to obtain sente.];W[cn]C[W62: White is not willing to fall behind, because White's outside is thick, here for Black to fight is unreasonable.];B[dn];W[cm];B[dr];W[er];B[cr]
;W[eq];B[fr];W[fs];B[jq]C[The attachment of B71 is Lee Sedol's first-rated game-deciding move!];W[fp]LB[jr:a][ir:b]C[W72 is a calm and good move, if White hanes at 'a', Black is just right to hane at 'b', this is the worst play for White.];B[kp];W[lq];B[lp]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.];W[pp]LB[op:a][oq:b]C[W76 is a good move! If Black hanes at 'a', White will  cut at 'b'.]
;B[qp];W[oq];B[pr];W[mp]C[After the hane of W80, Black already can't seal off White, it already leads to the situation where Black only has to escape, Black is already in a losing position.];B[mo];W[np];B[jp];W[no];B[mn];W[po];B[pn];W[qq]C[W88 is a clever order play.]
;B[qr];W[rq];B[rr];W[qn];B[qm];W[rn];B[rp];W[pm]C[The cut and atari of W96 is good playing tempo.];B[on];W[nn];B[om];W[nm];B[ol]LB[kn:a]C[B101: Black can only reinforce at 'a'.]
;W[kn]C[White hits Black's vital point, Black can only parry White's blows without being able to hit back.];B[jn];W[mm];B[hp];W[io];B[jo];W[gp];B[jl];W[ok];B[pk];W[mk];B[ho];W[hn]
