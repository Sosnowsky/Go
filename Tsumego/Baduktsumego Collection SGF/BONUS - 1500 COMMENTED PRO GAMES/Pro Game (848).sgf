;W[nc];B[pf];W[nq];B[pn];W[dj];B[jp]LB[oq:a][fc:b]C[The three-space pincer of B11 may come to nothing, Black can consider to make the diagonal extension at 'a' or directly approach the corner at 'b'.];W[pq];B[qq];W[qr];B[oq];W[pr]
;B[op];W[or];B[rq];W[lq]C[Through W20, the shape is settled, the position of B11 is not ideal.];B[fc];W[kc]LB[qh:a]C[The two-space extension of W22 is very steady, eyeing for the invasion at 'a' later on.];B[cf];W[df];B[dg];W[ce]C[W24 and W26 are pre-determined moves.];B[ef]
;W[de];B[jc];W[jd];B[ic];W[kd]C[Black attaches with B29 to dodge himself, exchanging with W30 and W32 equals to that Black makes two-space extension in sente, but in return, after White's two stones of W30 and W32, White becomes very thick.];B[fe];W[ec];B[fb];W[eg]LB[cg:a]C[W36: For White to atari at 'a' is steady, but since White is relatively thick, White still should elect to fight.];B[eh];W[fg]
;B[dh];W[fh];B[bf];W[bh]C[W42 is the vital point for the shape.];B[be];W[cc];B[ci];W[cj];B[bi];W[bj];B[ei];W[ch];B[di]
;W[ai];B[cg];W[ff];B[ge];W[ee];B[fi];W[hg];B[dn];W[ek];B[hi];W[fp]LB[gk:a]C[Although the jump of W62 is big, but for White to jump at 'a' is more urgent, not only eyeing for Black's big group and also naturally reducing Black's Sanrensei's power on the right.];B[mp]
;W[mq];B[fo]LB[fn:a][gk:b]C[The attachment of B65 is a good move! If Black jumps at 'a' as usual, then White will be very happy to jump at 'b'.];W[gp];B[hf];W[ig];B[gh];W[gg];B[fl];W[fk];B[gk];W[gj]LB[gl:a][fm:b]C[W74: White should simply cut at 'a', luckily White's atari at 'b' is working. Black may has overlooked this tactic.]

In the real game, White is left with a hidden trouble at 'd', Black is slightly favorable in the game.]
;B[bn];W[bl];B[aj];W[qh];B[do];W[ep];B[qj];W[qe];B[qf]LB[pe:a]C[The block of B109 is a mistake. Black certainly should connect at 'a', in the game White takes a lot of profit with the sequence following W 'a'.];W[pe];B[oe];W[qd]

;W[kb];B[id];W[ok];B[mi];W[on]LB[pm:a][np:b]C[The attachment of W142 is a good move! If Black retreats at 'a', White will push at 'b', Black is difficult to give komi, but after White's hane at 'a', Black is very hard to capture White.];B[np];W[pm];B[qn];W[qm];B[nm];W[ph]
;B[og];W[rj];B[qk];W[rk];B[ql];W[rl];B[rh];W[rn]LB[ri:a]C[W156: White should bump at 'a', Black also should bump at 'a', this way White is dangerous. Gu Li clearly has miscalculated the life and death here, White gets to easily make life on both sides, Black incurs a big defeat.];B[go];W[eo];B[en];W[ho]
