Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[pd]C[In the quarter final of Fujitsu Cup, I meet Park Jungsang 6p, in the opening, my situation is not bad, however in the middle game, I miscalculated, taking the game into a dire strait, it is very regrettable.];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[cf]
;W[fc];B[cn];W[fq];B[dj];W[qo];B[qk]LB[pl:a]C[B11: Black elected to play three-space low pincer, Teacher Fujisawa Hideyuki suggests to play two-pincer high pincer at 'a'.];W[rq]C[The play of W12 is very popular in the 80s of last century, now it is rarely seen, because of the configuration of B5, B7 and B9 on the left side, I feel Black is not bad.];B[po];W[pn];B[qp];W[rp]
;B[qn];W[ro];B[on]LB[qm:a]C[I was very hesitating when playing B19, and once thinking to simply retreat at 'a', but I worries, later on,  if I play atari on W14, White may take tenuki.];W[pm];B[qm];W[oo];B[pp];W[nn];B[qr];W[rr];B[nq]LB[rs:a]C[B27: For Black to directly capture White's corner at 'a' is a little risky.]
;W[rs]LB[pl:a][rm:b]C[W28: White can't first extend at 'a', otherwise Black has the clever move at 'b'! White's corner will die.];B[rn]LB[rm:a][om:b][kq:c][sn:d][ok:e][lq:f]C[B29: Black still should hang at 'a', White can only take at 'b', next B 'c', W 'd' and B 'e', White's shape is vivid. Please notice, when White takes at 'b', Black can't directly kill the corner, otherwise White will force at 'f', since White has more liberties, this is not to Black's advantage.];W[pl];B[ql];W[so]
;B[pk];W[nl];B[nk];W[mk];B[nj];W[lq];B[lp];W[kp];B[mp];W[jp]LB[kq:a][ln:b][ko:c]C[W42 is a good move! It is to my surprise. At the time, I thought White will connect at 'a', after Black jumps in sente at 'b', Black can hang out at 'c', W42 ruins my intention.]
;B[ln];W[ml];B[km];W[kk];B[im]LB[il:a]C[B47: For Black to make the knight's move at 'a' is Ma Xiaochun 9p suggested move, indeed it is not a bad conception. This way it would put much more pressure on the center white stones.];W[ik];B[pf]C[B49 playing defense is a must.];W[el]C[With W50, White hopes to have more stones on the outside, then attack Black's big group. As to this, Black's response is inappropriate, it directly leads to Black's defeat.];B[en];W[cl];B[hk]
;W[ij];B[ck]LB[gp:a]C[When B55, I'm very confused, I thought to first play at around 'a' to first take advantage with several moves and try to connect two groups together, but also feared it may lose some variations. In the game, Black is being separated and attacked, Black clearly fails. Looking back, Black still should play at around 'a'.];W[bk];B[bj];W[dk];B[cj];W[fn];B[ho];W[go];B[gp];W[hn];B[fp]
;W[io];B[hp];W[in];B[eo];W[dq];B[gm]LB[op:a][or:b][fm:c]C[The peep of B71 is an impulsive move! Black should directly make life at 'a' and 'b', White still has to reinforce at 'c'.];W[hm]C[Black incurs loss in the exchange of B71 and W72.];B[op];W[no]
;B[or];W[fm];B[bq];W[bp];B[bo];W[ap]LB[cp:a][br:b]C[The descent of W80 is slow. If White connects at 'a' instead, followed by B80 and W 'b', Black is very dangerous.];B[cp];W[cq];B[co];W[br];B[ao]LB[am:a]C[Due to the sente moves following B85, Black can cross over at 'a', Black steps over one crisis.]

;B[cc]C[B99: Black probably can only strike the corner. At this situation, it seems Black also doesn't have other better choices. However, after striking the corner, Black clearly underestimates White's thickness, which leads Black to a hopeless situation.];W[cd];B[bd];W[bm];B[ak];W[be];B[bc];W[ce];B[eb];W[fb];B[ec];W[ed];B[fd]
;W[hc];B[dc];W[df];B[fe];W[eg];B[cg];W[gg];B[he]LB[kd:a]C[B119: Black is too heavy to escape B111 and B115! Black should first play shoulder-hit at 'a' lightly, then consider to run out B111 and B115.];W[id]C[The diagonal of W120 is a good move, Black instantly sinks into a difficult situation!];B[ie];W[ig]
;B[jg];W[lg]C[After White starts to attack Black with the cap of W124, Black is losing the game.];B[ih];W[hh]C[Although Black's big group will not die, White takes the chance to enter into Black's right side territory by attacking, Black still will lose the game.];B[jh];W[hi];B[lf];W[mf];B[le];W[kd];B[lj];W[if]C[When B133, W134 is a good move!]
;B[kj]LB[lk:a][mj:b]C[B135: Black already has no other choices, if Black pushes and cuts at 'a', White can counter-push at 'b', Black has no follow-up.];W[lk];B[jf];W[mj];B[mc];W[ke];B[kf];W[mb];B[gf];W[hg];B[ee]
;W[de];B[je];W[ni];B[oi];W[oh]C[When White plays double hane with W148 and W150, Black's defeat is already decided.];B[fg]C[B151: Black makes the last-ditch effort.];W[pi]C[But White ignores it and plays atari with W152, capturing Black's big group, the exchange is not proportional, Black's defeat is even bigger.];B[fh];W[ri];B[rj];W[qj];B[rh]
