Translation:GoGameWorld.];B[qd]C[On 2/9, in the game 2 of the 2nd Yongda Cup best-of-3 final, Hu Yaoyu 7p defeated Shao Weigang 9p again, winning the champion by 2:0.];W[dc];B[pq];W[dp];B[de]
;W[ce];B[dd];W[cd];B[ec];W[cf];B[jc]C[Recently the "large avalanche" joseki was played too often, B11 is a new trend.];W[db]C[Of course, White's territory by the descent of W12 is also very impressive.];B[qk]C[What Black exchanges for is the opening speed, grabbing the extension on the right side with B13.];W[oc]C[Hu Yaoyu is well prepared and approaches in immediately with W14.];B[pc]C[With the diagonal extension of B15, Black starts to attack, it is also a planned strategy.];W[od]
;B[pf];W[lc]C[W18: White makes the two-space extension liberally, White's opening also can be satisfied.];B[ke]C[With the sequence following B19, Black continues to attack, however White locally already has a living shape.];W[me];B[lg];W[mg];B[mh];W[ng];B[ph];W[lh]C[White starts to counterattack with the cut of W26, Black looks a little far-fetched.];B[kg];W[li]
;B[ni];W[oi]LB[ji:a]C[With the sequence following W30, White allows Black to make a ponnuki, which is inexplicable! With W30 White instead should jump to 'a' to control the center, it is an absolute move! Why to play the "tesuji" of W30 and W32 when you are already alive?];B[oj];W[nj];B[mj];W[mi];B[nk];W[nh];B[gc]LB[fe:a][eb:b]C[The one-space extension of B37 is too conservative, the original shape is to play at 'a', this way next move at 'b' is huge, and White's turn is gote, Black can get to play at the bottom first.]
;W[pi];B[qi];W[pj];B[qj];W[jq]C[After White extends on the side with W42, both sides come back to the same start point again.];B[cn];W[co];B[dn];W[fp];B[cj];W[np]LB[po:a][on:b][oo:c][qq:d]C[The ensuing approach of W48 is relatively novel play, White's thinking is that, if Black answers at 'a', then White can make the knight's move at 'b'; If Black makes the knight's move at 'c', then White's attachment at 'd' would be an excellent move. Certainly, for Black to answer at 'a' is the correct move.]
;B[nq];W[mq];B[mp];W[no];B[lq];W[oq];B[mr];W[nr]LB[mq:a][op:b][pr:c][or:d][qo:e][po:f]C[Black absolutely didn't expect White's play of W54 and W56. To answer this, if Black connects at 'a', then W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 'e' and W 'f', Black is painful, and also Black's outside will come under attack after one stone being taken, Black is clearly no good.

;B[or]TR[nq][mp]C[B57: Black initiates the ko fight right away, undoubtedly this is a way leading directly to a fast defeat! Of course even if Black doesn't start the ko, Black is still hard to play. In terms of the root cause, Black's defeat is due to the attachment and cut of the marked black stone.];W[mq];B[eq];W[nq];B[ep];W[dq];B[er];W[bn]C[The hane of W64 is good order.];B[bm];W[eo];B[do]
;W[dr];B[cp];W[fq];B[iq];W[fr];B[en];W[fo]C[As for the result of the ko, Black indeed has incurred a big loss! Through W74, it again leads to an exchange, the ko on the right is almost White's unconditional loss! Black's defeat already can't be redeemed.];B[jp];W[pp];B[lr];W[qq];B[eb];W[jr]
;B[ir];W[ip];B[js];W[qm];B[df];W[dg];B[eg];W[dh];B[bh];W[bg];B[da];W[bb];B[ld]LB[kc:a][qb:b]C[The diagonal's extension of B93 is counterattacked by W 'a', as a result, White jumps to Black's corner at 'b'.]

;W[kd]C[With the sequence following W120, White again enters into Black's territory, Black's situation has further deteriorated, the difference between both sides has been enlarged.];B[le];W[jd];B[id];W[je];B[ie];W[jf];B[jh];W[kb];B[hg];W[bi];B[ci];W[ch]
