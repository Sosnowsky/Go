Translation:GoGameWorld.];B[pd]C[In the two semi-finals of China 17th Tianyuan Title, Liu Xing and Gu Li beat Wang Lei and Hu Yaoyu respectively and these two players will match to decide the final challenger.];W[dp];B[fq];W[cn];B[oq]
;W[qp];B[pn];W[po];B[oo];W[qn];B[pm];W[qm];B[pl];W[ql];B[pk];W[qj];B[dd]LB[ip:a]C[B17: For Black to grab the vital point of the moyo at 'a' is also possible, but next if White grabs the star point at 17, Black's stones seem a little over-concentrated on one side of the board.]
;W[iq];B[qq];W[rq];B[kq];W[io];B[fo];W[dk]LB[im:a][fm:b][em:c][hn:d]C[W24 is a wrong sequence play, White should first jump to 'a', after B 'b', then W 24; In the game, White first plays 24, then Black will not simply jump to 'b', instead he may turn to play at either 'c' or 'd'.];B[em];W[dm]
;B[hn];W[in];B[do];W[co];B[im];W[kp];B[lp];W[lq]LB[hm:a][jm:b]TR[hn]C[W32 and W34: After Black hanes with B31, White really wants to cut at 'a' imposingly, however after Black extends out at 'b', White has no good follow-up moves to deal with the marked black stone, so White first makes the sabaki plays with W32 and W34, and then seeks the chance to cut at 'a'.];B[jp];W[ko]
;B[jq];W[ip];B[lr];W[hm];B[dq];W[ep];B[cq]C[B41 and B43 are flexible moves, Black has already become thick on the lower side, so he doesn't need to strongly attack White, by simple taking some territory Black can be satisfied.];W[fp];B[gp];W[eq];B[er];W[gq];B[fr]
;W[cp];B[hl];W[gm]
(;B[gl]LB[gn:a][fn:b]C[B53: Black is clear that, if he stubbornly escapes at 'a', he would suffer White's extraordinary counterattack at 'b', then Black can no longer play freely on somewhere else (see var a).]
(;W[gr]LB[fm:a][fl:b][en:c][hq:d][go:e][jc:f]C[W54: If White bumps at 'a', then B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e' and B 54 (see var a), although White can capture Black, but Black would take the corner, after attaching three stones from the outside, later on Black can come back to grab the big point at 'f', Black's gains overweigh his losses.];B[gn];W[dr];B[cr];W[ds]C[Locally W56 and W58 are good moves.];B[cs];W[bq]
;B[br];W[ar];B[es];W[bo];B[hr];W[hq];B[ir]LB[jm:a]C[Although Black's corner has completely died, however,  after Black takes advantage in sente with B65 and B67, then extends out at 'a', later on, White still has to reduce liberties to kill Black, so overall Black has not suffered any loss.];W[gs];B[jm];W[kn];B[km];W[mo]
;B[mq];W[mn];B[jc];W[ml];B[oi];W[cf];B[fd];W[bd];B[qi];W[rj];B[lj]LB[je:a][oc:b]C[B83 is a way to handle this situation, but after being capped by White at 'a', Black seems to have accomplished nothing. For Black to secure the big corner at 'b' may be the most profitable move.]
;W[je];B[eg];W[le];B[lc];W[kh];B[mh];W[ih];B[cg];W[cc];B[dc];W[bf];B[id];W[qc]LB[ie:a][qd:b]C[White enters the corner with W96, which demonstrates the excellent consciousness of victory and defeat. If White simply encloses the territory at 'a', Black will protect the corner at 'b', White's territory would be insufficient.]

;W[og];B[nf];W[ie];B[cb];W[bb];B[cd];W[bc];B[ji];W[ii];B[kf];W[hd]LB[jd:a][ic:b][ld:c]C[Where to play W120 is a difficult problem. The most relentless play is to squeeze at 'a', after B 'b', White then doubles up at 'c', living inside Black's territory. If so, Black can only kill White's big dragon in order to win the game.]
;B[he];W[hf];B[ge];W[kc];B[kd];W[ke];B[ld];W[me]C[The sequence from W120 to W128 is safer but damaging to the points.];B[ng];W[fh]LB[jj:a]C[W130 is an overplay, White should make one eye at 'a'.];B[ri]
;W[rh];B[gg]C[In the game After Black separates with 133, White sinks into a bitter battle.];W[jj];B[hg];W[ig];B[gi];W[kj];B[li];W[ki];B[lg];W[ll];B[kk];W[gj]

(;B[hj]LB[fj:a][fk:b][ik:c][pp:d][qr:e]TR[fh]C[B145: Black is overzealous. Black should hane at 'a', W 145, B 'b' and W 'c', White makes life and during attack Black has already captured the marked white stones, Black then come back to grab the biggest endgame at 'd' and 'e', Black will win the game by a small margin (see var a).];W[gh];B[fj];W[fi];B[gk];W[hh];B[di]
;W[fg];B[gf]
(;W[dh]LB[ef:a][if:b][ej:c][jf:d][pq:e]C[W154 is the losing move. Liu Xing said, only if White hanes at 'a', after B 'b', W 'c' and B 'd', an exchange results, then White has the chance to grab the last big endgame at 'e', White will instead win the game by a small margin (see var a).];B[dg];W[ch];B[bh];W[ci];B[bg];W[bi];B[if]
