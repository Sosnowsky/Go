;B[qo];W[ro];B[rm];W[qq];B[rn];W[pr];B[on]C[The sequence from B17 to B25 is also one joseki, however it is rarely seen nowadays, comparatively, at this situation most players like to have White who takes territory.];W[oo]LB[or:a]C[The cut of W26 is to obtain sente, if White takes tenuki, Black's hane at 'a' is very big.];B[pm];W[qf];B[qe]
;W[pf];B[nd];W[pi];B[ic]LB[fc:a]C[B33: The common move is to approach the corner at 'a'.];W[lc]LB[mg:a]C[W34: White's big knight's move at 'a' is the original move.];B[re]LB[mg:a]C[B35: Black can consider to make the knight's move at 'a', trying to utilize his thickness in the lower right corner at the maximum limit.];W[mg];B[kd]
;W[kc];B[nf];W[ng];B[mf]LB[jd:a][oc:b]C[B39 and B41 are thoughtful moves, if Black retreats at 'a', White can make life by striking at 'a', Black comes to nothing.];W[oc]LB[og:a]C[W42 is a good move, not only Black guards against Black's hane at 'a', ......];B[nc];W[jd]LB[nb:a]C[......, and also White is left with the aji at 'a'.]
;B[lg];W[mi];B[jc];W[id];B[hd];W[hc]C[Following W48 and W50, White elects to sacrifice and very stress on the whole game.];B[hb];W[gc];B[he];W[ke];B[ld];W[if];B[gb]
;W[fc];B[fb];W[ec];B[eb];W[db];B[cc];W[dc];B[hf]LB[mc:a]C[B65: If Black doesn't attach out and reinforce at 'a 'instead, although Black can capture two stones, but after White presses at 65, overall White is favorable.];W[ig];B[hg];W[ih];B[df]
;W[od]LB[cf:a][cg:b][ce:c][dg:d]C[White's tactic following W70 is very enticing, but Choi Cheolhan is too hasty. White should first play at 'a', next B 'b' and W 'c', if Black connects at 'd', then White can play W70.];B[oe];W[nb];B[ob];W[kb];B[ib];W[mb];B[pc];W[la]
;B[cb]C[The clamp of B79 is severe!];W[ca];B[ba];W[da];B[cd];W[ef];B[eg];W[ee];B[dg];W[ce];B[de];W[bd];B[be]
;W[bb];B[cf];W[bc];B[ce];W[ff];B[fg];W[aa]C[White can only make life in gote in order not to reduce liberties.];B[li]C[But after Black takes thickness, Black attaches out with B99, White on the right side comes under attack and also White in the middle still needs to avoid being sealed off, the situation has been turned around.];W[mj];B[lj];W[hi];B[qh]LB[mk:a][ck:b]C[B103 is unnecessary, to play hane at 'a' is already very adequate, White has to make life painfully, Black can obtain sente and make extension at 'b'.]
;W[qi];B[ph];W[rh];B[rg];W[si]C[W108 is a little surprising.];B[rj]LB[oi:a][lh:b][oh:c][oj:d][og:e][ri:f]C[But the strike of B109 is a bad move. Black should simply hane at 'a', since B 'b' is sente, White can't cut at 'c', next W 'd' and B 'e', this is clearly better than the real game. Due to the addition of W 'f', White can cut at 'c', B103 and B105 already can't connect back.];W[ri]
;B[lh];W[le];B[oh];W[oi];B[og];W[ml]C[After White jumps out with W116, Black's situation becomes difficult.];B[md];W[ji];B[kl];W[nh];B[sg];W[lm];B[op]
;W[no];B[np];W[mo];B[or];W[pp];B[qm];W[oq];B[nq];W[rr];B[ps];W[pq]LB[lq:a][dj:b]C[W134 is a very local move, now to make the knight at 'a' is the biggest on the board, even if Black plays two more moves, Black still can't kill White's corner, on the left side to make extension at 'b' is also very big.]
;B[mr];W[lq];B[lr];W[qs];B[qk];W[kq];B[ko]LB[kr:a]C[The strike of B141 is a strong move, if Black simply blocks at 'a', White can jump at 141 and make a good shape.];W[km];B[lk];W[nm];B[lp];W[il]LB[jl:a][jk:b][ik:c][lf:d]C[W146 is the losing move! White should play hane at 'a', next B 'b' and W 'c', Black can only connect back at 'd', this way White is favorable for the game.]
;B[ik];W[hk];B[hl]C[After Black cuts with B147 and B149, White has no answer.];W[gk];B[jl];W[mp];B[mq];W[kp];B[jp];W[lo];B[kr];W[im];B[ok]
;W[nk];B[jm];W[kn];B[jo];W[mn];B[ck]C[Black gets to make extension with B165 and separate White in the center, taking a lot of advantage in points, so far Black becomes favorable, till the end.];W[jn];B[in];W[hm];B[hn];W[gm];B[lf];W[dj]
