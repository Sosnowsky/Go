;W[ce];B[pj];W[nc];B[pf];W[pb]LB[jd:a]C[W10: White can consider to make extension at 'a'.];B[fq];W[cn];B[jp]LB[ne:a]C[Next with W14, White can also jump to 'a'.];W[qc]C[It seems W10 and W14 are overly territory-oriented.]
;B[fo]C[From B1 to B15, Black makes a big moyo.];W[dk];B[le]C[B17 is the vital point for the game.];W[ql]C[The invasion of W18 makes Black a little difficult.];B[qn];W[ol];B[ml];W[oj];B[oi];W[pk];B[qj];W[nj]
;B[qd];W[ni];B[oh];W[kj]C[Through W30, White jumps out successfully.];B[lc]C[However, how Black to attack? It is very difficult to make quick decision in fast games.];W[lq];B[pc]LB[rc:a]C[B33 is a mistake under time pressure, Black should play hane at 'a' instead.];W[rc]C[W34: White descends alertly.];B[jq];W[ob]LB[nq:a]C[But just because of this move (W34), White elects to retreat with W36 with favorable consciousness. White can consider to attach at 'a'.]
;B[mn];W[kd]LB[id:a]C[W38 is careless and White's wishful thinking! White should simply make extension at 'a'.];B[jd]C[B39 attaching from outside is good move, White can only turn body around.];W[eq];B[fr];W[hd];B[ke]LB[rd:a]C[After Black blocks with B43, B 'a' makes White painful.];W[di];B[hf]
;W[rd]LB[ee:a]C[W46: White should reinforce at 'a'.];B[df];W[cf];B[pm];W[rf]LB[ij:a]C[W50: White should directly jump out at 'a'.];B[nh];W[qh]C[Because Black blocks with B43, White starts to play a string of bad moves from W46, W50 and W52.];B[re]C[Black's tactic following B53 is clever.];W[qf]

;W[kk]LB[rn:a][ih:b]C[Following W68, White's play is a little chaotic. White should first attach at 'a' to probe Black, then jump to 'b'. This way White's big dragon at least is not going to die.];B[ej];W[dj];B[jm];W[gi];B[fc];W[fd];B[ed];W[ec];B[fi];W[gh]

;B[ep];W[bp];B[dq]C[But in the lower left corner, Black takes ponnuki, White's loss is even heavier.];W[ne]LB[cq:a]C[Following W104, White loses common sente. White's situation is not favorable, but White can only play atari at 'a'.];B[pf];W[og];B[nd];W[ng];B[me];W[mg];B[rh]
