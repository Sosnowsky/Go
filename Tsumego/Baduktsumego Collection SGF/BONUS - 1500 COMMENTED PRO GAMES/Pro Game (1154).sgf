;B[qf];W[qc];B[rc];W[le];B[mc];W[of];B[je]C[Through B25, it seems Black's shape is not bad.];W[hf]LB[hd:a]C[W26 is Lee Sedol's style, but by Gu Li's style, Gu Li also wouldn't tolerate at 'a'.];B[jg]C[After Black jumps out with B27, it leads to a fight.];W[hd];B[eg]
;W[gg];B[ic];W[hc];B[ib];W[ee];B[df];W[eb];B[fb];W[ed];B[ea];W[fe];B[cg]C[B41: Black is able to hang with a good shape and shouldn't be afraid of White.];W[bg]
;B[ch];W[bh];B[ci]LB[cj:a]C[However, the extension of B45 is a little heavy, for Black to jump at 'a' is better.];W[gj];B[dm];W[hb];B[cb];W[bb];B[ca];W[dk]C[W52: White invades.];B[ck]

;B[el];W[bi]C[Through W68, White obtains some territory, but most white stones are in the second or third line, White's efficiency is not high.];B[do];W[ep];B[cp];W[co];B[cn];W[bo];B[bp];W[bn];B[bm];W[cm];B[dn]

;B[hp];W[fo];B[gm]C[Through B95, Black's tempo is good.];W[ho];B[io]LB[hl:a][hh:b]C[But B97 is inexplicable, I feel to play hane at 'a' is urgent. White can't take tenuki with his big group. Otherwise Black will make knight at 'b', White is about to die, this way Black is clearly favorable.];W[ip];B[hq];W[hm]C[After White hanes with W100, Black cuts, it is already half-step late.];B[gi];W[hi]
;B[gk];W[fk]C[Also with the eye space of B103, White can handle the upper and lower side separately.];B[fi];W[hh];B[hn];W[in];B[jo];W[gn];B[fn];W[lo];B[ko];W[hn];B[eo]
;W[ln];B[hl];W[hk];B[il];W[jm];B[ij];W[hj];B[km];W[jl];B[kn];W[ik];B[lp]C[Through B127, White becomes thick on the board, Black also have gained some territory, it is a close game.];W[pc]
;B[rb];W[md]LB[hr:a][nc:b][kd:c]C[The diagonal of W130 is good move! Since W 'a' is ko threat, Black dares not extend at 'b', otherwise White will make diagonal at 'c', initiating a ko fight.];B[ld];W[ke];B[me];W[nd];B[kd];W[lg];B[ob];W[kg]
;B[rp];W[pb];B[id];W[qh];B[qg]LB[re:a]C[B143: Black should strengthen to make life at 'a', this way the outcome is still difficult to guess.];W[ph];B[cr]C[B143 and B145 are losing moves of this game!];W[mb]LB[sf:a]C[Gu Li clearly overlooks White's killing tactic from W146 to W 'a'.];B[nb]
