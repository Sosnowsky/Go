Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.]RE[B+R];B[qd]C[On 6/13, the title match 4 of the 61st Honinbo comes to an end, Takao Shinji 9p, the defending champion, defeated Yamada Kimio 9p by resignation, leading the best-of-7 series by 3:1, he is only one victory away from successfully defending his title.];W[dd];B[pq];W[po];B[cp]
;W[oc];B[ld]C[Both players are of fight-oriented style, right from the opening, they start to fight fiercely. However, overall from the whole game's viewpoint, it seems Takao Shinji's strength is relatively bigger.];W[nd];B[pg];W[qq]LB[qb:a]C[W8 and W10 are clearly against Go theories, Black gets to first jump to 'a', White is not good, with W8 for White to attach at 10 is normal.];B[fc];W[cf];B[qb];W[jd];B[lc]LB[lf:a]C[B15: Black is strong and unyielding, but if Black sticks the head out at 'a', the speed is faster.]
;W[mf]C[W16 is a good move.];B[ke]C[B17 is slow and Black is not comfortable.];W[gd];B[kg];W[mh];B[fd]C[Black directly pushes out with B21, the fight starts and runs till the end of game.

After this move, it is time for lunch break.];W[ge];B[fe];W[gf];B[ff];W[gg];B[fg]
;W[ki]C[W28 is strong!];B[gc]LB[ji:a][hc:b][hb:c]C[As to this, with B29 Black should directly attach at 'a'. In the game, after the exchange of B29 and W 'b', Black's tactic of crossing over at 'c' disappears, Black incurs loss.];W[hc];B[ji];W[gh];B[kh];W[li];B[ih];W[dg]C[W36 is the vital point, Black is not comfortable.]
;B[fh];W[hi];B[jj];W[fi]C[After the tiger's move of W40, Black is difficult to get out and can only try to make life in the corner.];B[ei];W[eh];B[fj];W[gi];B[hb];W[ic];B[de];W[ce];B[cc]
;W[ej];B[cd];W[di]C[White makes ponnuki with W52 from outside, Black fails in the fight.];B[pj]LB[kk:a]C[B53 taking territory is an overplay, Black should make diagonal at 'a'.];W[of];B[pf];W[kk];B[jk];W[jl];B[il];W[kl]C[From W56 to W60, White forces Black to play dame moves next to White's thickness, White takes a big advantage.]
;B[hk]C[After this move, the game was closed for the first day.];W[jn]LB[im:a]C[But in such a favorable situation, W62 is a big slow move! White certainly should play hane at 'a', forcing Black move towards White's thickness at the top, Black is painful.];B[im];W[ko];B[ho]LB[qr:a][kq:b]C[White's one step is slow, Black instead forms a certain moyo with B65, since 'a' and 'b' are miai, Black must get one, White can't form territory, White's situation becomes difficult.];W[qp];B[kq];W[jq];B[jr]
;W[iq];B[ir];W[hq];B[kp];W[jp];B[nq]C[B75: Black simply makes life.];W[or];B[mp];W[oq];B[op];W[nr];B[mr];W[no]
;B[ln]C[Next Black instead starts attacking White's super dragon with B83, this must make Yamada Kimio feel very bad!];W[ep];B[oe];W[ne];B[ml];W[mk];B[ng];W[mg];B[kj];W[lk];B[ni]C[B87 to B93 are happy sente moves to take advantage.];W[mi]
;B[fl];W[np];B[mq];W[oo];B[hr];W[gq];B[mn];W[jm];B[ql]LB[cm:a]C[Next B103 is very relentless! In fact, after taking so much advantage, Black can strengthen at 'a' calmly, Black is already good enough. In the game, Takao Shinji may want to destroy his opponent psychologically!];W[dn]C[W104: White starts the final attack, it seems White can certainly do something here.];B[bn]
;W[bm]LB[jf:a][gn:b]C[But the direction of W106 is clearly wrong. If White first peeps at 'a', then attacks Black's big dragon in the center at 'b', the outcome of the game is still difficult to guess.];B[io];W[jo];B[cn]C[B109: Black counter-attacks strongly, it must be a surprise to White!];W[cm];B[dm];W[en];B[em];W[cq]C[When B113, White is already very confused.];B[cl]
;W[bl];B[ck];W[bk];B[bq]LB[bj:a][cj:b][bi:c][el:d]C[B119 is steady, in fact Black can hane at 'a', next W' b', B 'c' and W 'd', leading to a ko, but there is no ko threat on the board, this way Black can win the game at one stroke. However, even in the game, White doesn't gain much in the attack, Black is still in a winning situation.];W[dp];B[co];W[fm];B[fn];W[gm]
