;B[do];W[co];B[dp];W[cp];B[eq];W[cn];B[dn]C[B7, 9 and 11 forms "big avalanche" joseki, this is the most studied joseki by Chinese players recently.];W[dm];B[cq];W[dr];B[bq];W[cr];B[cm]

;B[fo];W[dj]C[The sequence through 32 is normal.];B[ao];W[ap];B[am]LB[ci:a]C[B33 and 35 is new trend. If B33 extends at 'a', Black worries that later White will hane at 35, then Black's eye shape is much worse than in the game.];W[ar];B[bs];W[aq];B[an];W[cs]LB[bk:a][bj:b][gn:c][ci:d][cg:e]C[W40 worths more study. This move should consider cutting at 'a', Black will capture at 'b', White can get sente and cap at 'c', White can fight. In the game, Black played at 33 and 35 in sente and then extend at 'd', it already has a living shape, later White pressing at 'e' is meaningless. So B33 novel play succeeds.]

;W[hc];B[oc];W[hn];B[fm];W[gl]LB[gp:a][hq:b]C[The exchange of W58 and B59 should be reserved, later White can play at 'a', Black will connect, also White can play at 'b' and drive Black to White's thickness.];B[ip];W[ie];B[ke];W[qn];B[pk]LB[np:a][qk:b][qo:c][pn:d][qi:e]C[B63 is questionable, in the game Black ignored that Black on the left is very thin, so Black suffers White's fierce counter-attack with W64 and W66! Black don't have good follow-ups. B63 at 'a' is the proper play, then W 'b', B 'c', W 'd' and Black press at 'e', Black is much better.]
;W[on];B[np];W[lp];B[pm];W[pn];B[mo];W[jo];B[gp];W[mm];B[mk];W[om];B[lo]LB[qq:a]C[B75 is a very bad move! This move should be at 'a' to reinforce, in the game after exchange with W76, Black on the left suddenly becomes very dangerous.]
;W[jp];B[rp];W[pi]LB[km:a][hq:b][gq:c]C[But W78 is overhasty and premature! White should reinforce with jumping at 'a', Black has to make life and play at 'b', then White can invade at 78, Black will fall into a bitter battle. If Black doesn't reinforce at 'b', White has a clever play to squeeze at 'c' and kill Black. Because White did't play this way, later after Black gets head out with the diagonal move, White, however, becomes thin, there is a big difference.];B[nl];W[qk];B[ql]LB[pl:a][qj:b][rm:c][rn:d][rl:e]C[B81 is a very crude play! it should connect at 'a', then W 'b', B 'c', W 'd' and B 'e', Black is better.]
;W[qj];B[pl];W[nj];B[nk];W[mn];B[qg];W[pg];B[qh];W[ph];B[li]LB[ll:a][lh:b]C[B91 is conservative, due to sente moves around 'a', Black should make a big knight move at 'b'. This will put more pressure on White.];W[mg]

White should do the exchanges with W 'a', B 'b', W 'c' and B 'd', then 'e' and 'f' are miai, White is alive locally, then seize to capture at 'g', this way White still have chance to win.]
;B[il];W[ik];B[hl]C[In the game, B127 and 129 captured two White's stones, White's territory is clearly not enough. The later endgame moves have nothing to do with the outcome of the game.];W[hk];B[jl];W[kj];B[ki];W[ig];B[jg];W[mi];B[ih];W[oq];B[op]
