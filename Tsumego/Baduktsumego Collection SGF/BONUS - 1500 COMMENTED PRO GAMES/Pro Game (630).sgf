;W[cf];B[kc];W[qj];B[pi]C[The play of B9 is popular nowadays.];W[qi];B[ph];W[qh];B[qg];W[pj]LB[qm:a]C[If B3 is at the star point, with W14 White can play at 'a' steadily.];B[qn];W[pg]C[The cut of W16 leads to a fierce fight.]
;B[og];W[pf];B[qf];W[of];B[ng];W[pd];B[pc];W[od];B[qc];W[ld]LB[ni:a]C[W26: White should first strike the square at 'a'.];B[ni]C[B27 is the vital point, Black's shape is smooth.]
;W[pm];B[qm];W[pl];B[nf];W[me];B[lc]C[B31 and B33 are unique, their result is not bad and they can be considered good moves.];W[mh];B[mi];W[lh];B[nh];W[lf];B[li];W[kh]
;B[ki];W[ji]LB[jh:a]C[W42 is a strong move! Normally White will retreat at 'a'. In the opening, Zhou Heyang's play is such strong and unyielding, and it is rarely seen.];B[jh]C[Black cuts strongly with B43, the fight is red-hot.];W[jf];B[ih];W[hf];B[kd];W[jg];B[hg]C[B47 and B49 are vital points. 

After this move, it is time for lunch break.];W[jj]LB[gf:a][ij:b]C[W50: If White extends at 'a', Black can capture W42 at 'b', White is not good.]
;B[gf];W[he];B[fg]C[Black encloses White's big dragon with B51 and B53, the situation is really chaotic.];W[ke];B[md];W[ne];B[le];W[hc];B[gd];W[hd];B[nc];W[lk]C[W62 can't be omitted! If Black sticks his head here, White's situation will be very bad.]

;B[fb];W[jd];B[ld];W[jc]C[Since B71 and B83 are all damaging ko threats, White elects to retreat with W90 and W92, after they make compromise, the situation is about even.];B[dg];W[cg];B[dh];W[ci];B[ej];W[oo];B[pp]C[Black strengthens his dragon with B93 to B97, it is necessary.];W[nq]LB[or:a]C[W100: White can consider to play at 'a' directly, in the real game, Black's outside is defective and Black is not comfortable.]
;B[iq];W[or];B[pr];W[gq];B[lq];W[jr];B[ir];W[kq]LB[dq:a]C[W106 and W108 are postive moves! Normally White will extend at 'a'. In the game, White takes a big risk, if White can't achieve anything by attacking, White's territory will be inadequate.];B[eq];W[dq];B[dr];W[gr]
;B[ep];W[cr];B[er]C[W112 and W108 are related strong moves, if White plays at 113 with W112, Black can bump and crossover, White will come to nothing.];W[go];B[do];W[co]C[After W118, at a glance Black is difficult to handle both sides, but Xie He's following sequence to dodge is really beautiful!];B[cn];W[bp];B[br];W[bq];B[lr];W[kp]
;B[bo];W[cp];B[lp];W[jq];B[np]C[Black first handles the left side lightly with B119 and B121, then turns his body around with B127 and B129, clevely leaving the problem to White. Now if White can't kill Black on the left side, Black is clearly leading in territory.];W[eo];B[fo]C[B131: But Black obviously underestimates Zhou Heyang's boldness.];W[dn];B[en];W[fn];B[do];W[ee]C[When B135, White unexpectedly dares initiate the all-dominant ko with W136! In terms of result, Xie He already has no way to retreat.]

;B[ek];W[dk];B[gp]C[In fact, when Black plays B131, Black is very easy to play, Black can elect to play at either 147, 149 or first exchange B165 and W153, at any rate Black on the left side wouldn't die unconditionally, the result will be all better than the real game. Of course, if White has no courage to initiate the ko, then B131 will be the best move. After White wins the ko fight, White takes a big advantage. Even like this, White still can win the game by a small margin if playing endgame normally.];W[fp];B[jp];W[fq];B[ca];W[cb];B[mn];W[rk];B[rl];W[ig];B[ii]
