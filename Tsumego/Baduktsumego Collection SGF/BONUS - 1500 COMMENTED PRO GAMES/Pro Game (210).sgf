(;SZ[19]DT[1990-03-08]EV[Japan 28th Judan Title final game 1]RE[W+R]PC[Japan]PB[Cho Chikun]BR[9p]PW[Takemiya Masaki]WR[9p]KM[5.5]C[Copyright by gogameworld.com and weiqi.tom.com.];B[qd]C[Cho Chikun and Takemiya Masaki are long-standing opponents. So far Cho Chikun has only won back-to-back Honinbo titles,  as for Cho Chikun, this is quite insufficient. So this year no matter what happens, he needs to protect his Judan title, therefore, he will go all out to fight and win this best-of-5 series.];W[dp]C[Four years ago, Takemiya was also the challenger, but he was easily defeated by Kobayashi Koichi with 3:0. This time, he starts to challenge the rising star Cho Chikun, so what will happen?];B[cd];W[pp];B[oc]
;W[ed];B[ec];W[fc];B[dc];W[fd];B[cf];W[jd]C[Certainly Takemiya taking White still goes for the big framework, but the opening is different from taking Black, it needs to take more effort for White to enclose a big moyo.];B[qn];W[np];B[rp];W[ql]C[White clamps with W16, aiming at the outside thickness.];B[qq]
;W[qo];B[ro];W[pn];B[pm];W[qm];B[rn];W[om]C[Through W24, it is a common joseki, both sides are very satisfied.];B[je]LB[he:a][hd:b]C[The ladder breaker of B25 is the only move, if B 'a', then W 'b', Black would accomplish nothing.];W[pl]LB[ke:a][id:b]C[W26: White can only take, if White plays at 'a' in reply, then B 'b', White is hard to handle.]
;B[kd]LB[id:a][ic:b]C[For B27, Cho Chikun has pondered for a long time, if B 'a', W 'b', Black has no severe follow-up measures.];W[kc];B[id];W[jc];B[ic]C[B29 and B31: Black adopts the separate-and-attack maneuver, thus both sides have entered into the middle game fight in the very early stage of the game.];W[ie]C[The cut of W32 is inevitable.];B[ib];W[ke];B[jf];W[ld]
;B[he]C[Through B37, White's three stones in the upper left still have some scope for action.];W[fg];B[hg];W[dg]C[W38 and W40: White runs out, it is very big.];B[cg]C[B41 reflects Cho Chikun's ardently love for territory.];W[dh];B[ci];W[pr];B[qr];W[gq]C[W46 protecting the corner is the big point, White's configuration on the lower side is good.];B[cj]
;W[fi];B[ho]C[The reduction of B49 is very interesting.];W[dk]C[W50 is a play of Takemiya's style.];B[kg]TR[ho]C[The diagonal extension of B51 forms a good shape, it also indirectly helps the marked black stone at the bottom.];W[ch];B[bh];W[de];B[ce];W[nd]C[W56 is inevitable.];B[hq]LB[ej:a]C[B57: Kato Masao 9p thinks Black should jump to 'a', but this way White could enclose the lower left territory, which Cho Chikun grudges, so Black attaches at 57, it is understandable.]
;W[hr]C[W58: White can only play like this.];B[gp]LB[iq:a]C[B59: After Black hangs from the above, if White ataris at 'a', an exchange would be inevitable. Therefore, Black should extend to 'a', this is much simpler. After the game, we learned that Cho Chikun thinks he is favorable in the opening, so later on he elects to play more solid moves.];W[iq];B[fq];W[hp];B[gr];W[hq];B[dq];W[cq];B[ep];W[do]
;B[eo];W[dn];B[gn];W[jo];B[io];W[jp]C[Through W74, the local fight comes to a temporary end, with regard to the result, White can be satisfied.];B[cl];W[dl];B[cm]C[B75 and B77 are moves in the consciousness of superiority.];W[dm];B[dr];W[pf]C[W80 is Takemiya's distinctive play, it is also the famous move for this game. Indeed, no matter how Black responds, it all will help White to form a good shape.]
;B[od];W[oe];B[rf]C[B83: Black continues to adopt his completely territory-oriented strategy.];W[lh]C[The shoulder hit of W84 is a good move to enclose the center territory.];B[lg];W[mg];B[mf];W[mh];B[nc]C[B87 and B89: Black obtaines territory and also threatens White's eye shape.];W[lf];B[qg];W[ii]C[The knight's move of W92 is a superb move.]
;B[lb]LB[jn:a][gb:b]C[B93: Black has to reinforce, although B 'a' is more urgent, but if White makes the diagonal extension at 'b', then Black's big group would be dangerous.];W[im]C[W94: White has grabbed the last big point, White is favorable.];B[pi]C[After B95, Cho Chikun has already entered the byo-yomi, but Takemiya still has 2 hours left in the regular time.];W[ph];B[pg];W[kb];B[nf]LB[ia:a]C[B99 is a move that Cho Chikun has regretted. After the game, Cho Chikun pointed out that Black should stand at 'a'.];W[mb]
;B[mc];W[lc]C[It is big for White to capture one stone with W100 and W102, and moreover White has made two eyes.];B[nb]LB[og:a]C[B103 is the losing move, after exchanging for W 'a', White gets a half point advantage unconditionally.];W[og];B[md];W[la];B[na];W[ma];B[ja];W[ka];B[gb]
;W[qh]TR[pi]C[W112: White pushes down and hurts the marked black stone, Black has suffered a big loss.];B[rh];W[qi];B[fb];W[of];B[ri];W[qf];B[rg];W[qj]C[Through W120, the fight on the right side comes to an end.];B[gl]C[After B121, Cho Chikun has realized that the game is not to his advantage, but it is already too late. So far the shapes and positions on the board are all clearly settled, Black already has no chance left.
