;W[de];B[nq];W[qn];B[ce]C[B9 shows Chen Yaoye's style of ardent love for territory.];W[cf];B[cd];W[gp]C[W12 is rarely seen, White may plan to win with unfamiliar variations.];B[eo];W[dn];B[el]C[B15 is old joseki and now rarely seen.];W[en];B[fo]
;W[dq];B[er]LB[fn:a]C[B19 puts emphasis on territory, normally Black is reluctant to allow White take advantage, for Black to play at 'a' is more common.];W[jp]LB[fm:a]C[W20 is novel play, the common move is to stick out head at 'a', White has nothing to complain.];B[fn]C[Black turns with B21 and becomes very thick, White's novel move is not successful.];W[cm];B[gl];W[lq]LB[ck:a][dk:b]C[W24 and B 'a' are good miai points, White can't take both. In terms of result, B 'a' is more severe, so with W24 for White to play at 'b' is better.]
;B[ck];W[df];B[ed];W[ci];B[di]LB[cr:a]C[B29 is good move, Black aims to jump at 'a', White is not easy to handle.];W[cj];B[dk];W[dj]LB[cr:a][bk:b][dh:c]C[W32 is bad move, quickly leading to White's deterioration! Now White can only calmly reinforce the corner at 'a', waiting for chance. Since White's corner is not alive, B 'b' is sente, Black can extend at 'c', White has no good follow-up.]
;B[ej];W[ei];B[cr];W[bq];B[do];W[co];B[dh];W[fj];B[ek];W[dd]C[W42 is damaging move.];B[ec];W[cc];B[bc]
;W[cb];B[bb];W[bf];B[bd];W[bk]C[Then White plays W50, in order to live, "brothers" have to fight with each other.];B[bl];W[bj];B[cl];W[bm];B[am];W[an];B[al];W[dr]
;B[ds];W[br];B[ch];W[bh];B[ak]C[Especially Black destroys eye in sente with B63, White is very painful.];W[cg];B[aj];W[bi];B[eh];W[ff];B[fi];W[hf]C[W70: White has to escape lonely, while White has gained no profit and Black becomes thick.]
;B[hd];W[gh];B[pq];W[qq];B[qr]LB[op:a]C[B75 is steady, since there are ko threats in the lower left corner, Black can also play at 'a', interesting play.];W[oq];B[pr];W[op];B[qp];W[rq];B[rp];W[rr]
;B[rs];W[or];B[sq];W[gr];B[gi];W[hi];B[hj];W[ii];B[ij];W[ji];B[nc]C[B93: Black is simply favorable for the game. In comparison, on the board White's thickness and territory are all inadequate.];W[rd];B[qf]
;W[rf];B[qg];W[qc];B[pc];W[jc]LB[je:a]C[W100: White desperately grabs territory, the original move is to make knight at 'a'.];B[qd];W[rb];B[re];W[se];B[qe];W[pb];B[ob]
;W[qa];B[if]C[Black starts to conduct two-prolonged attack, White is really painful. Cho Chikun's tenacious style is vivid on board, better die in glory than live in dishonor.];W[he];B[id];W[lc];B[ib];W[ic];B[hc];W[jb];B[hb];W[le];B[ie];W[lg]C[W120: White can't connect.]
;B[ig];W[hg];B[kh]C[After Black separates with B123, White is about to collapse.];W[lh];B[li];W[ki];B[mi];W[nh]LB[jh:a]C[W128: If White pushes down all the way at 'a', White can save the tail, but on the outside W120 and W124 will be captured, White still suffers a big defeat.];B[kf]C[B129: Black cuts White's way back in sente.];W[lf];B[ee]
;W[ef];B[ni];W[oh];B[ih];W[hh];B[kk]C[After B137, White's big dragon has no way to live.];W[jk];B[kl];W[jl];B[jm];W[jj];B[im];W[fh]
