Copyright by gogameworld.com and weiqi.tom.com.];B[pd];W[dd];B[qp];W[dp];B[op];W[nc]C[W6 is rarely seen, Xie He commented. The modern opening is to make extension on the right side, for example, playing at star point.]
;B[pf];W[jd]C[Through W8, it seems Hu Yaoyu's original plan is to conduct territory-race in this game, therefore he elects to play this new opening.];B[cf]LB[fq:a]C[The play of B9 makes this game a close one. Since Black has pressure of big komi, Black didn't elect to play at 'a' to form a territory race, approaching the corner with B9 to achieve stone efficiency is already inevitable.];W[ch];B[cc]C["Zhou Junxun loves territory, his style is relatively steady, which was just showed by the play of B9 and B11", Xie He added.];W[dc];B[cd];W[de];B[bf];W[eg];B[fq]
;W[dn];B[dr];W[qh]LB[qj:a][oh:b][oj:c]C[W20 to pincer-attack first is positive play. Next if Black plays low pincer at 'a', White can jump to 'b' then cap at 'c', White's shape is vivid. After study, pros think, Black doesn't have any good follow-up tactic.];B[qk]C[In the game, Black elects to play two-space low pincer, it is inevitable.];W[oh];B[nf];W[nd]C[W24 finally shows White's originally planned strategy, taking territory after faking to build influence. Most pros think, Hu Yaoyu still relatively likes territory.];B[qg];W[ri]C[The diagonal of W26 is a good move locally. Yu Bin thinks, to enter the top right corner is huge and must-obtain point for both sides.]
;B[qc];W[rg];B[rf]LB[re:a]C[After W28, White has the tactic of playing ko and pincer at 'a', Gu Li loves this variation.];W[qm]LB[ok:a]C[The pincer of W30 is questionable, Chang Hao thinks, White have spent a few moves here and didn't achieve anything, it must be questionable. Gu Li thinks, now White should cap at 'a', this way the game would be still long.
];B[qj]C[After study, Chang Hao, Yu Bin and Luo Xihe think, before W30, the first questionable move is W24. This move appears relentless, but its direction is wrong. Luo Xihe said, "you certainly should play at your weak place, so with W24 for White to play at 29 is most important". Even if Black can play at 24 and get good eye shape, it is not that important as imagined.];W[om];B[oj];W[pi];B[ok]
;W[mh];B[ng];W[nh];B[pg]LB[mk:a][re:b]C[B37 and B39 are crude moves. The purpose is to reinforce the defect of White's pincer at 'b', then obtain sente and jump to 'a', Black's advantage is obvious.];W[oi];B[mk];W[mm];B[kk];W[ki]C[Through W44, Yu Bin is worried that White's three stones W30, W32 and W42 might get cap-killed, White is very dangerous.
];B[sg]
;W[rh]C[W46: White is a little confused. High hands think unanimously, at this time White should initiate the ko and try to grab sente, White can find ko threats in the upper left corner. In this game, White plays this "honestly", Zhou Junxun must be very comfortable!];B[jm];W[lo];B[ij]LB[jk:a]C[B49: Black has no assurance of killing White's four stones, so Black elects to reinforce his own defect first. However, Chang Hao thinks, White still has the defect at 'a', although Black's situation is still better, White didn't play well "anywhere".];W[mq]C[Through W50, Xie He feels that B49 is slow move. Although Black has no assurance to kill, Black still has to attack.];B[pn];W[pm];B[nr];W[ip];B[kd]C[Through B55, high hands think the fight in the upper right corner will decide the game, now the situation is not clear.

After this move, it is time for noon break.]
;W[ke];B[ld];W[jc];B[kf]LB[le:a][lb:b]C[B59 looks like a clever move, but not in reality. Kong Jie, Zhou Heyang and Wang Lei think, if Black directly plays at 'a', W56 still can't be ataried, so White has to extend at 59. Black can jump to 'b' and capture W6 and W24, which is bigger than the real game. In the game, White gets a chance to turn body around and fight in another place.];W[le];B[lf];W[ii];B[me];W[je];B[md];W[hj]
;B[ik];W[hi]C[Through W68, White gains some profit.
];B[gl];W[gp];B[eo]C[B71: Wang Lei analyzes, the purpose of this move is, due to addition of this peep, you don't need to worry about the center any more.];W[do];B[cq]C[After calculating points, through B73, Black has 55+ points on the board, White is falling way behind in territory. Zhou Heyang said, it is difficult for White to catch up in points unless some "weird" moves are found.];W[gn];B[el];W[cl]C[W76 is calm move. Gu Li judges, only if White captures Black's big dragon, Hu Yaoyu may have a chance to win, with W76 White is waiting for chances.];B[lm]
;W[ln]LB[li:a][ml:b][mn:c]C[W78 is questionable. Kong Jie thinks White should simply retreat at 'c', since Black has the killing move at 'a', when Black bumps at 'b', White couldn't counter-atari B77 and can only reinforce as in the real game. The game proceeds completely as Zhou Junxun had imagined.];B[ml];W[nn];B[kn];W[in];B[ko];W[kp];B[li];W[lh];B[kj]
;W[jh];B[kb];W[jb]C[Through W90, national players judge, Zhou Junxun's big dragon already makes life in sente. If playing endgame normally, Black wins the game for sure.];B[mr];W[lr];B[cb];W[db];B[da];W[ea];B[ca]C[Through B97, Peng Quan judges, Black has about 60 points on the board, White 45 points, Black is leading by 15 points.];W[lb];B[mb]
;W[kc];B[lc];W[ka];B[nb];W[pq];B[qq];W[nj];B[mj];W[ni];B[nl];W[po];B[pp];W[dq]
;B[eq];W[hl]C[W114: White had wasted one chance to overturn the game, analyzed by Wang Lie, White should first play atari at 'a'.]LB[ll:a];B[hk];W[il];B[lp]C[B117 is not simple and clear enough.];W[ll]C[After the atari of W118, the outcome of the game is difficult to guess.];B[nm]C[B119: Black makes mistake again.
];W[km];B[on];W[gk]C[W122: Hu Yaoyu misses the last winning chance. High hands think unanimously, now White should play atari B121 all the way to the second line, then take most advantage by using ko threats.]
