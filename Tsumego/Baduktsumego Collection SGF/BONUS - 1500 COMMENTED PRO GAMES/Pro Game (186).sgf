;B[dp];W[cp];B[eq];W[cn]LB[cq:a]C[Lee Changho elects to play two facing small points, in terms of psychology, with W10, White should make a comprise by playing at 'a', however in the real game the fight already starts, White has to face the war.];B[dn];W[dm];B[cq];W[dr];B[bq];W[cr];B[cm];W[cl]
;B[br];W[er];B[bm];W[bn];B[fq];W[bp];B[bl];W[fo]LB[fr:a]C[White elects to strike with W26, in the last several years Lee Changho played this move to me a few times, the common move is to tolerate by crawling at 'a'.];B[en]C[B27: Black certainly should stick the head out, although the shape is not good, but Black has to play this way.];W[dl]C[The connection of W28 is pre-planned.];B[ck]
;W[fr]C[W30: White has to crawl on the second line.];B[fn]C[Black presses with B31 to counterattack.];W[ek]LB[gq:a]C[W32 is a questionable move, White should directly hane out at 'a', Black has no way to capture the marked three stones.]TR[dl][dm][cl];B[dk];W[el];B[gq];W[ci];B[di]
;W[dj]LB[dh:a]C[W38: White certainly should consider to play hane at 'a', this way Black is not easy to answer.];B[cj];W[ej];B[bi];W[ch];B[bh];W[cg];B[bg];W[cf];B[bf];W[ce];B[gr]LB[bs:a][fs:b]C[B49: Black should first descend at 'a', making sure the hane at 'b' is sente.]
;W[bs];B[jd]C[In the game, White obtains outside thickness but ends in gote, after Black gets to play the excellent point with B51, White's outside influence can't be fully utilized.];W[qf]LB[nc:a]C[The key is how White should play W52? In the game Black didn't hesitate and answered with the small knight's move at 'a', preventing B51 from being attacked. If I were White, either I will approach the corner at 'a' or first play in the lower side, observing how the game proceeds.];B[nc];W[rd];B[qg]LB[qc:a]C[After the approach of W52, White makes the knight's move of W54, now the diagonal at 'a' is already not big, Black bumps outside with B55, it is the right choice.];W[pg];B[qh];W[ph]LB[qc:a]C[After the upper hane of W56, White presses again with W58, it is too formalistic, White already has thickness on the left side, here White is no good to become thick again, with W58 White should simply make the diagonal move at 'a'.]
;B[rf];W[qe];B[qj];W[pi];B[qk];W[qc];B[pc];W[re];B[oq];W[np];B[pn];W[jp]C[W70 is inevitable.];B[in]
;W[iq]LB[nq:a]C[The questionable move is the diagonal of W72. This move is absolutely sente and should be reserved, White is not worried about Black's invasion on the second line. With W72, White should simply block at 'a', Black is hard to play the hane and connect on the second line.];B[hp];W[nq];B[nr];W[mr];B[or]C[With B75 and B77, Black reinforces the corner and these two moves are also excellent points to attack.];W[oo];B[po];W[hc];B[of];W[pf]LB[kc:a]C[As to the peep of B81, White should take tenuki and invade at 'a' instead! White's outside is thick and shouldn't worry about Black's gote cut, besides, White's situation is not optimistic, White can't be so conservative!]

;W[kl]LB[mo:a]TR[oo]C[The sequence from B83 to W96 is proceeded as planned from both sides, due to the peep of W78 (the marked white stone), Black can't extend B93, however Black is left with the striking move at 'a', White is very painful!];B[jb]C[The jump of B97 is huge!];W[le]LB[ie:a][je:b][hi:c]C[W98: If White encloses territory by the knight's move at 'a', then after Black attaches 'b', Black can reduce at 'c', White's territory would be inadequate. So White releases this game-deciding move!];B[ke]LB[kf:a][kc:b][mc:c]C[Black is not willing to fall behind, Black can also consider to make the knight's move at 'a', however Black is still worried about White's tactic of W 'b' and 'c'.]
;W[kf];B[jf];W[kc];B[jc];W[kd];B[je];W[mc];B[mb];W[lb];B[ma]C[Black can only give way to play B107 and B109, White clearly gains in this fight.];W[lf]LB[he:a][me:b][oe:c]C[However, the ensuing W110 seems inevitable but is really worth study! Now jumping at 'a' is the vital point, if Black cuts at 110, then W 'b', Black takes, and White can connect at 'c', Black's ponnuki in the center is not that big as expected, and Black also has to strengthen to make life in gote, White can adequately fight.]
;B[fc]C[The invasion of B111 is very severe, which White didn't expect.];W[hd]C[White has to face the fight with W112.];B[ge];W[he];B[hf];W[gf]LB[fd:a]C[But the cut of B116 is unreasonable, it is the losing move of this game! White can only attach at 'a'.];B[ff];W[gg];B[fd]C[B117 and B119 are strong moves, White is hard to handle.];W[ee]LB[fg:a]C[W120: If White turns at 'a' instead, it would lead to a seki in the capturing race, White perhaps still have a chance, because Black still has several unsettled groups.]
;B[fe];W[ho];B[go];W[gm];B[gn];W[if];B[hg];W[ig];B[hh];W[ie];B[eh]C[White connects out with the dame of W130, Black gets to make the diagonal extension of B131, White suffers an overwhelming defeat.];W[ei]LB[jg:a][gh:b]C[W132: If White blocks at 'a', then Black will turn at 'b' to form an exchange, White is no good.]
;B[fh];W[dh];B[jg]C[After B135 presses out, White already collapses.];W[ih];B[hi];W[ii];B[hj];W[ij];B[ik];W[gk];B[hk];W[la];B[md]
