Translation:GoGameWorld.];B[pd]C[The fights between teacher and student of Cho and Lee were once most familiar things for all of us, but recently this was rarely seen, especially in serial games.];W[dp];B[qp];W[dd];B[fq]
;W[cn];B[kq];W[qj]LB[qg:a][qf:b]C[The opening of B1 to W8 is very common, but the ensuing plays are many, including the diagonal's hit in the game, 'a', 'b' and etc, Korean players indeed should take a lot of credit on those innovations.];B[pk];W[qk];B[ql];W[rl];B[pj];W[rm];B[qi];W[pl]
;B[pi];W[ol];B[po];W[qm];B[mp]C[It comes to a temporary end after Black reinforces with B21.];W[nc];B[oc];W[nd];B[jd]C[In response to the approach of W22, Black first makes the diagonal's hit with B23 then clamps with B25, Black is very proactive, Cho Hunhyun knows very well that he must be active when facing with Lee Changho.];W[pe];B[qe];W[pf]
;B[od];W[ne];B[qd];W[mg];B[rh]LB[ro:a]C[The diagonal's move of B33 is a good move locally! Later on, B 'a' is basically sente, Black has gained some profit.];W[hc];B[jf];W[qg];B[rg];W[jc];B[kc];W[kd]
;B[ic];W[jb];B[ld];W[ke];B[ib];W[id];B[je];W[hb];B[lf];W[lc];B[kb];W[ia];B[kf]
;W[ka];B[le];W[lb]C[From W38 to W56, each side takes one stone, White is favorable locally.];B[cd]C[But Black has gained sente and gets to attach the corner first at 57, Black still keeps the initiative for the whole game.];W[cc]LB[ce:a]C[W58: If White hanes outside at 'a', Black will counter-hane from the left, this would become another game, however in the game, White's thickness could not be utilized, Black has nothing to complain.];B[ce];W[bc];B[ef]LB[dc:a]C[B61 is careless, Black should cut at 'a' to probe White, making White over-concentrated, then consider to make extension on the side, this would be perfect for Black.];W[hf]LB[dj:a]C[W62: White runs out with the knight's move to separate Black, but it seems that nothing will come of it, making the extension at 'a' is usual.]
;B[ed]LB[dj:a]C[The clamp of B63 is unnecessary, Black should simple make the extension at 'a'.];W[dc];B[dj];W[hh];B[ki];W[cg]C[The invasion of W68 is a game-deciding move! However White is worried that his territory is inadequate.];B[dh]C[B69 is a steady move.];W[de];B[ch]LB[gg:a][dr:b]C[But the connection of B71 is slow. Black should peep at 'a', White connects, then Black makes the knight's move at 'b', this way Black is leading in territory and favorable for the whole game.]
;W[dr]C[After White jumps down with 72 to protect the corner, it becomes a close game, Lee Changho endgame skill can be fully utilized.];B[ro];W[rj];B[er];W[eq];B[fr];W[cl];B[go]LB[eo:a][do:b][cf:c][dq:d][dm:e]C[B79 may be the cause of Black's over-optimism on positional judgement, Black should instead make the knight's move at 'a' to probe White, if White attaches at 'b', then Black can hit at 'c' to capture one stone, this is huge; If White answers at 'd', then Black can take the chance to peep at 'e', this way Black has the possibility of enclosing territory in a big scale.]
;W[bg];B[gj]C[After B81, Black can't find any good move and can only bluff. On the other hand, White invades step by step, this is Lee's style, Lee Changho is confident on this kind of close games.

After this move, it is time for noon break.];W[ii];B[mh];W[ik];B[el];W[eo];B[im];W[km];B[co];W[bn];B[ng];W[nf]
;B[mm];W[kj];B[lj];W[kk];B[kn];W[fn];B[hl]C[Black makes threatening gestures everywhere, however White is very prudent, through B99, Black has basically enclosed the side territory.];W[nh]C[With the sequence after W100, White starts to swallow slowly.];B[mi];W[og];B[ji];W[hk]
;B[gk];W[lg];B[ig];W[fh];B[hi]C[Black can't help but to play the crude diagonal's move of B109.];W[gi];B[hj];W[ih];B[jh];W[ij];B[gg];W[hg];B[gh]
;W[ln];B[lm]TR[ln]C[With regard to the hane of the marked white stone, Black is very painful, to retreat simply is clearly passive. In the game, after Black separates and captures one stone, Black still has to worry about White's invasion, Black hasn't gained much, exercising patience may be better.];W[jn];B[ko];W[jm];B[gf]C[B123: Black has lost his calmness.];W[hq]C[The invasion of W124 is severe!];B[fo];W[fi]LB[gl:a][eg:b]C[The connection of W126 is an asking move and good timing, aiming at the cut at 'a' and making the diagonal's move at 'b' to atari and wrap up Black.]
;B[en]C[With the sequence after B127, Black has ignored his cut points in order to have a chance of winning, but after White ataris and wraps up Black from both left and right sides and forces Black to make life, Black has clearly incurred some losses in the end.];W[em];B[dn];W[dm];B[do];W[cp];B[ep];W[bo];B[eo];W[gl];B[fl];W[gm];B[ej]

;W[bj];B[ai];W[df];B[eg]C[What's is worth mentioning is that Black has to reinforce, otherwise if White makes the diagonal here, although Black can capture three stones, but Black is still not alive, please fight out the variation yourself. Moreover, Black will lose the ko fight at the bottom unconditionally, so Black can't make life depending on the multi-stage ko, Black has suffered a big loss in the endgame.];W[cj];B[ci];W[ri];B[qh];W[on];B[no];W[nb]C[In the end, W176 is unnecessary, but it has nothing to do with the outcome of the game.];B[ob]
;W[oa];B[pa];W[na];B[pb];W[qf];B[rf];W[fc]C[Through W184, White has grabbed the final big endgame, White wins for sure.];B[hn];W[lk];B[he];W[ie];B[nj];W[nm]
