;W[gp];B[ho];W[gq];B[jo];W[qq]LB[rq:a]C[The opening up to W24 is exactly same as that of one semi-final game between Cho Hunhyun and Ma Xiaochun in 2001 Samsung Cup, in that game Cho 9p took Black, next he elected to clamp at 'a'.];B[qr];W[qn]LB[pr:a][rq:b][nn:c]C[W26: White can consider to cut at 'a' to probe Black, if B 'b', then W 'c', this is better than the simple attachment of W26.];B[on]

;B[fd];W[ig];B[fh];W[dh];B[hi]LB[fj:a][ii:b][dj:c]C[The knight's move of B57 doesn't make the right shape, Black is better to jump at 'a', next the cap at 'b' and the jump at 'c' are miai, Black will be sure to get one.];W[ej]C[W58 is a good move, not only expanding his own influence but also aiming at Black's thinness.];B[jh];W[kf];B[lg]C[B59 and B61 seem a little unreasonable.]
;W[gh]LB[he:a]C[W62 is sharp, Black has no good follow-ups locally, so Black tenukis to jump at 'a'.];B[he];W[kd];B[jc];W[gi]LB[hg:a]C[The push of W66 is careless! it can be said that this is the losing move of the game, after being cross-cut at 'a', the situation becomes completely chaotic. White should draw back at 'a', It is simple and clear and White would be still favorable.];B[hg];W[hh];B[ih];W[hf]C[The sequence after W70 is inevitable for both sides.]

;B[fi];W[gj];B[fj];W[fk];B[gk];W[hj];B[eg];W[ic]LB[kg:a][jf:b][fb:c]C[W90 is the last losing move, when Black ataris at 'a', White couldn't connect back his two key stones which are captured by B 'b'. No matter how powerful Cho Hunhyun 9p is, he could not turn the game around. White should calmly turn at 'c', this way the game would be still very complicated. In this game, the young Niu Yutian played brilliantly in the face of the strong opponent and finally defeated the unstoppable Cho 9p (who won 6 games in a row before this game), it is not easy!];B[hc];W[ib]
