Translation:GoGameWorld.];B[pd]C[In the last game of the second phase of 5th Nong Shim Cup, Won SeongJin 5p of Korea (White) defeated Ryu Shikun 9p of Japan by resignation, easily achieving three consecutive wins and also helping Korean Team take the lead in this ring tournament.];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[qk]C[The "Chinese Fuseki" is very popular in the second phase of this Nong Shim Cup, 4 out of 6 games start with the "Chinese Fuseki".]

(;W[oo]LB[po:a][jp:b][pp:c][qp:d][qo:e][qq:f][nq:g][np:h]C[B7: If Black answers at 'a', White will extend at 'b', this variation is steady. In the game, the pincer is initiative. With W8, to attach at 'c' is very common, Cho Hunhyun 9p likes to play this way very much, but I personally feel that this is not to White's advantage, because after White's attachment at 'c', then B 'd', W 'e', B 'f' and W 'a' (see var a), next no matter whether Black jumps to 'g' or attaches at 'h', Black would be much more active.];B[qo];W[gq];B[kn];W[om]LB[nm:a]C[W12 is a novel play, the common play is making the knight's move at 'a'. Having the courage to make novel plays, Korean players must specially have studied on these moves.]
;B[pn]LB[qm:a][on:b]C[B13: Black doesn't want to strengthen at 'a', after forcing White to connect at 'b' by the diagonal's peep, Black tenukis to attack White's big group. However, in fact, after the peep of B13, the aji of Black's lower-right corner is very bad, always lacking one move. The following process in the game shows Ryu Shikun has paid a huge price for obtaining sente.];W[on];B[kl];W[oj];B[ok];W[nk];B[pk];W[lm];B[km];W[nj];B[nl]
;W[ml];B[ol];W[nm];B[lj]LB[lk:a]C[B27 is a general feeling of Japanese players, in fact Black should peep at 'a', taking sente and forcing White to connect.];W[lk]C[In the game, Black has to make a "shape" by the knight's move, as a result, White simply obtains sente by the diagonal's extension of W28.];B[kk];W[ph]C[When White plays W30, White already can strike first in the lower right corner.];B[ln];W[mm];B[pf]LB[or:a]C[B33: However, Black has completely neglected the tactic in the corner, otherwise, Black will immediately come back and reinforce with the diagonal's extension at 'a'.]
;W[ng];B[lh]C[B35: Black is still perverse to attack White's big group, the false impression goes deeper and deeper. In this moment, Won SeongJin must be complacent: having given you several chances, but you still couldn't see it!];W[qp]C[W36: White finally shows the knife! It can be said that because of this "flying knife", this game is already practically over.];B[pp];W[pm];B[qm];W[po];B[qn];W[qq]C[Here Ryu Shikun must have miscalculated, only when White crawls with W42 then he clearly sees that he is in a big trouble!]
(;B[pr]LB[qr:a][rr:b][ro:c][rn:d][rp:e][sq:f][sn:g][rl:h][sr:i][rs:j][or:k]C[Why we are saying that? Normally With B43 Black should hane at 'a' to kill White, but if that's the case, then W 'b', B43, W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f', W 'g', B 'h', W 'i', B 'j' and W 'k'! next no matter what happens, because White extends one liberty by playing the hane at 'g', Black is always one liberty short and will get killed!

Therefore, in the game, Black has to descend in order to kill White.];W[qr];B[rp]
;W[ro]LB[rq:a]C[When White blocks with W44 and Black hanes with B45, White can't block at 'a' impulsively, otherwise all the previous efforts will be wasted, in the game, W46 is a good move for extending liberties!];B[rn];W[or];B[oq];W[nr];B[nq];W[mq];B[rq]LB[lr:a][ps:b][sr:c][mr:d]TR[ro]C[Through B53, although Black can kill White's corner, but the tiger's move of W 'a' is always sente, White's big group can easily escape. This equals to Black's overall plan in the opening comes to nothing! Here I need to explain, with B53 Black can't kill White by descending at 'b', because if Black descends at 'b', White can jump to 'c', Black has no any follow-up maneuver. The marked white cut is just used to extend one liberty, either Black cuts at 'd' to sacrifice one stone or Black's big group will get killed.]
;W[jq]LB[dj:a]C[W54: White clearly thinks that the game is to his advantage, if White tenukis to grab the big point at 'a', White will be more initiative.];B[ci];W[cg]LB[ck:a]C[W56: White can consider to block at 'a', this way Black's big group will probably come under attack, Black's situation will deteriorate.];B[cn];W[ck];B[cp];W[cq];B[dq];W[ep];B[bq]
;W[cr];B[bo];W[br];B[fc]LB[do:a]TR[ck]C[B67: Black should hang at 'a', attacking the marked white stone by using his center thickness, but after incurring a big hit in the lower right corner, Ryu Shikun's state of mind is already not right.];W[hc];B[fe];W[dc];B[ef];W[dg];B[ei];W[eg]
