;B[cj];W[qg];B[fc]C[Black elects to play a steady opening.];W[hc]LB[cf:a][cm:b][fq:c][kc:d]C[The pincer of W10 is more often seen than the knight's move at 'a', next B 'b' and W 'c', this will form a prolonged war. In the real game, 'd' and 'c' are miai and Black must get one to play.];B[fe];W[cf];B[db];W[cc];B[cm]
;W[kc];B[fq];W[dn];B[bo];W[dm]LB[dk:a]C[W20: White very wants to strike at 'a', but Black definitely will counterattack by attaching at 20.];B[cl];W[nq];B[fo];W[fm];B[jq];W[pn]LB[qn:a]C[The high pincer of W26 is a good move, if White approaches low at 'a', Black will attach at 26, White appears over-concentrated.]
;B[on]LB[np:a][mp:b][no:c][oq:d][po:e][qr:f]C[The direction of B27 is correct, if Black presses at 'a', then W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 'e' and W 'f', this is White's ideal shape.];W[pm];B[np];W[qq];B[oq];W[qp];B[mq]
;W[cb];B[he];W[gd]LB[mc:a]C[W36 making diagonal and cut is unreasonable. Since White in the lower left corner is not alive, White is thin on the board. With W36 White should make one-space extension at 'a', this way it is still a very long game.];B[fd];W[ge];B[gf];W[hf];B[ie];W[ib];B[gg];W[hm];B[mc]
;W[hg]C[Although W46 pressing out is far-fetched, White has no other choices due to earlier mistake.];B[gh];W[hh];B[hi];W[jg];B[jf];W[gi]C[After this move, it is time for lunch break.];B[gj];W[fi];B[eg]C[B53 and B55 are good moves! Kong Jie's judgement is very clear, in the real game an exchange is unavoidable.];W[fj];B[hj]
;W[jh];B[fk];W[ek];B[el];W[fl];B[gk];W[dj];B[dl];W[dh];B[em];W[gb];B[ch];W[dg]
;B[di];W[eh];B[il]C[Through B73, Black is clearly favorable.];W[eq]LB[fr:a]C[Following W74, White perhaps has made miscalculation, originally there will be some aji left if White attaches at 'a'.];B[fr];W[bp];B[co];W[br];B[er]C[Through B79, White dies very cleanly.];W[kl];B[im]
;W[ld];B[ji];W[ki];B[kj];W[jj];B[ii];W[lh];B[lj];W[nl];B[jk];W[nd];B[od];W[mn]

;W[md];B[lb];W[oo];B[no];W[nn];B[oe];W[pr];B[po];W[qo];B[or]C[Afterwards, although White continues for a while, but Kong Jie responds with no mistake, in the end Black is leading about 15 points on the board.

The following moves are omitted.])
