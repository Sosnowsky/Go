;W[ce];B[cf];W[cd];B[nq];W[qn];B[iq];W[df];B[cg];W[ef];B[cj];W[ep]C[The opening from B1 to W16 is same as last game.];B[dn]LB[dq:a]C[B17: Black starts to vary, Black made diagonal at 'a' in last game.]
;W[en]LB[cq:a]C[W18: White prepares to attach at 'a'.];B[eo]C[B19: Black starts to counterattack, here starts the fight.];W[do];B[fo];W[dp];B[co];W[cq];B[bq];W[fp]C[From W20 to W26, they start close-contact fight.];B[gp]LB[br:a]C[B27: Black must play hane. If Black plays loosely, White's double-hane at 'a' will be working.]
;W[dr]LB[gq:a][cr:b][cn:c]C[W28 looks like a mistake. White should first play hane at 'a', after Black retreats, White can descend at 'b'. This way, Black needs to guard against White's atari at 'c', White is clearly better than the real game.];B[cr]C[Black gets to atari with B29, White is already not favorable in the capturing race.];W[dq];B[br];W[gq];B[hp];W[fr];B[hr];W[gr]C[W34 and W36: White can only live in gote.]
;B[dm]C[B37: Black succeeds in the first fight.];W[hq]LB[gn:a]C[W38: White has to squeeze and capture in gote. Otherwise Black hangs at 'a' in sente and White is too painful.];B[ip];W[ir];B[jr];W[hs];B[oc]C[After Black defends the corner with B43, Black is favorable in the opening.];W[ej]LB[ck:a]C[W44: White aims to attach down at 'a'.];B[ei]C[Black's play following B45 is questionable.]

;B[ih]LB[cl:a]C[Especially B57 and B59, to cross over at 'a' is more substantial.];W[em]LB[bn:a]C[W60: White escapes and blocks crossover and it is kind of sente. Otherwise if W 'a', Black will be exploited terribly.];B[dl];W[dk];B[bm];W[qi]LB[jq:a]C[W64: White aims to cut at 'a'.];B[fk]C[B65: Black attacks in order to defend, the situation is complicated.];W[gk]
;B[gl];W[el];B[hk];W[gm];B[gj];W[ek]LB[hl:a]C[W72: For White to play atari at 'a' is normal, White is difficult.];B[hm];W[hn];B[in];W[im];B[hl];W[fm]
;B[go];W[jn];B[io];W[jl];B[jk];W[ji]LB[ik:a]C[W84: For White to play wedge at 'a' is compromise. If Black seals off, White is not comfortable. But White seems more uncomfortable in the game.];B[ik];W[fj];B[kl];W[bl];B[am];W[jh]
;B[km]LB[ln:a][no:b]C[B91 is mistake! To make knight at 'a' is clearly better than real game. And for Black to jump to 'b' is more positive.];W[jf];B[he];W[jd];B[hc];W[fc]C[With W92 to W96, White attacks loosely.];B[fe]LB[qg:a]C[B97 is of favorable consciousness. Even if Black takes tenuki, White couldn't kill. For Black to make extension at 'a' on the right side is very big.];W[oe]C[W98 is absolutely not a good move! But now White indeed has no other good place to play.]
;B[pf];W[nc]C[White first strengthens himself, then slowly waiting for chances.];B[nb];W[ob];B[pb];W[od];B[pc];W[mb];B[oa];W[mc];B[pr];W[qq];B[no]C[B109 and B111 are over steady, Black should directly enter the corner at 110.]
;W[kr]C[W112: White probes Black.];B[js];W[mn]LB[mp:a]C[W114: For White to peep at 'a' is better.];B[nn];W[jq];B[kq];W[jp];B[lr];W[kp];B[lq];W[kn]
;B[jm];W[lm];B[ll];W[ml];B[mk];W[nk];B[nl]LB[nm:a]C[B129: Black should extend at 'a'.];W[mm];B[lj]LB[lk:a]C[B131: Black should connect at 'a'. This way Black's big group in the center is already alive completely. Then Black can extend B129.

B129 and B131 are the main reason leading to Black's defeat.];W[nm]
;B[nj];W[ok]C[Black perhaps overlooks W134.];B[pj]C[B135: Black has to pierce through.];W[oj];B[pi];W[ni]C[But after White counterattacks, Black's big group in the center is not alive.];B[li]C[B139 is overplay! Now Black's big group in the center is still not alive. However, Black is already difficult to win the game.];W[ph];B[oh];W[og]C[W140 and W142 are Lee Sedol's top-rated sharp play.];B[qh]
;W[pg];B[ri];W[oi]C[W146 is calm and declaration of victory!];B[qj]C[Black reinforces in the center in gote and is clearly not good.];W[gn]C[W148: White releases the killing move.];B[ki];W[jj];B[kj];W[lk];B[kk];W[mj];B[mi]
;W[lk]C[The center becomes two-step ko, White wins the game happily.];B[mh];W[lg];B[mk];W[jo];B[il];W[lk];B[lo];W[ln];B[mk];W[ho];B[im];W[lk]
;B[mg];W[nf];B[mk];W[nj]C[Lee Sedol plays the relentless move of W172 and kills opponent.];B[mf];W[me]C[Lee Sedol comes back from behind and wins Toyota Cup again.];B[lf];W[kf];B[le];W[ld];B[ke];W[je]
