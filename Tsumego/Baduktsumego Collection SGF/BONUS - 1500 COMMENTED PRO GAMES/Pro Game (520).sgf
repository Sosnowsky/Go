;W[pg];B[od];W[pj];B[cn];W[fp];B[nq]C[With the sequence following B11, Gu Li elects to play the double approach, which is Gu Li's favorite,  he used this approach against Kato Masao recently, but I feel it is not necessarily to Black's advantage.];W[co];B[qn];W[np];B[mp];W[no];B[pq];W[qq]
;B[oq];W[qp];B[jq];W[pm];B[dn];W[cj];B[cg];W[cl];B[em];W[ek];B[gm];W[fn];B[fm]LB[eo:a]C[As to the peep of W30, with B31, Black should diagonal-peep at 'a', the play in the game is too heavy.

;W[gk];B[im];W[ip]C[White strikes back by separating Black with W34, showing Cho Chikun is still full of youth energy.];B[iq];W[hl];B[hm];W[jp];B[hp];W[ho];B[go]LB[hq:a]C[As to the press of W38, although Black is painful, but Black couldn't play the double hane at 41, with B41 Black can only connect at 'a', White draws back, then Black fights a capturing race with White in the center.];W[hq]
;B[gp];W[gq];B[eo];W[fo];B[gn];W[ep]C[In the game White first takes territory with W48, on the outside who has the advantage is still hard to judge, Black's playing strategy is heavy and territory-damaging, it is indeed hard to agree to.];B[kp];W[ko];B[lp];W[jn];B[ln];W[km];B[il]LB[jk:a][jm:b]C[In order to take initiative, with B55 Black certainly should fly out at 'a', because B 'b' is absolutely sente.]
;W[ij]C[White tangles tightly with the cap of W56, Black is painful.];B[jj];W[ii];B[jk];W[lm];B[mn];W[lk];B[ji];W[jh];B[ih];W[gi];B[nm];W[kh]
;B[lj];W[nl];B[mj];W[om]C[Perhaps Black thinks he can attack White, but up to W72, Black needs to jump out in gote, White gets to strike first in the center, Black's judgement is definitely wrong here.];B[mh];W[ig];B[hh];W[gg]LB[gf:a]C[W76: For White to make the knight's move at 'a' directly is good enough.];B[hg];W[hf];B[if]
;W[ik]C[The most inexplicable is that in this crucial moment White squeezes at 80 in gote, at least White should squeeze when playing W78.];B[gf];W[jl];B[jm];W[kl];B[kn];W[kj];B[jg]C[With the sequence from B81 to B87, it forms an unbalanced exchange, White incurs a loss of about 20 points, Black establishes an absolute advantage.];W[kg];B[kf];W[ec];B[lg]
;W[ki];B[dc]LB[he:a]C[Next Black releases so many bad moves, it seems another guy came and played the game, B93 taking at 'a' is simple and clear.];W[de];B[ce];W[db];B[cb];W[he];B[ge];W[hd];B[gd];W[ic];B[gc]LB[hc:a]C[B103: If Black squeezes at 'a', Black would win the game at one stroke.]
;W[jd];B[kc];W[lf];B[ke];W[mf];B[nf]LB[ld:a]C[B109: It is unnecessary for Black to push on in the flush of victory, only if Black reinforces at 'a' to conduct an exchange, Black already achieves a big victory.];W[kd];B[ld]LB[le:a]C[B111: If Black plays at 'a', it would lead to a complicated situation.];W[je];B[jf]
;W[le];B[me];W[lc];B[mg];W[jb]C[After White lives with W118 and the game enters into the endgame phase, but Black is still having a big lead.];B[qh];W[qi];B[hb];W[mb];B[hr];W[gr];B[ir];W[bn]
;B[fg]LB[ri:a]C[Black can win the game if Black stands at 126 with B123 or Black plays hane at 'a' with B127.];W[qg]C[After White blocks with W128, White finally sees some hope.];B[op];W[oo];B[qr];W[rr];B[pr];W[rs];B[ob]LB[ie:a][kb:b][rf:c]C[Next Black's chance is to push at 'a' with B135, White can only take at 'b', then Black can make the knight's move at 'c'.]
