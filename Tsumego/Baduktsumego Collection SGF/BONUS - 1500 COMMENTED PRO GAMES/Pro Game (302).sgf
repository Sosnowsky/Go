In this game, Teacher Nie's play is very light and clever, however how to control unfamiliar situation is also young player's weakness.];W[cp];B[pq];W[dc];B[de]

;B[lo];W[lq];B[mr]LB[ko:a]C[B33 is a slow move, Black should extend at 'a', this way White can't play somewhere else on both sides.];W[mm];B[ko];W[qj]C[White counter-clamps with W36, Black is difficult, here Black's territory is destroyed by White, Black fails doubtlessly.]
(;B[qk]LB[qn:a][pp:b][rn:c][po:d][qm:e]C[In the game, the sequence following B37 is indeed very crude, however there is no other good way, if Black clamps at 'a' now, then White ataris at 'b' in sente then hangs at 'c', B 'd' and W 'e', Black will fail (see var a).];W[pj];B[nl];W[qf];B[pf];W[pg];B[qg];W[qm]LB[ol:a]C[Because the eye shape of W44 is abundant and Black still needs to protect White's wedge at 'a', Black already is hard to strongly attack White.]

(;W[rk]LB[rg:a][rh:b][rl:c][rm:d]C[W48: The correct play of W48 is first playing atari at 'a' then pressing, after crawling at 'b', then White can play W48, next B 'c' and White's clamp at 'd' will be effective. This way White can obtain superiority at one stroke.];B[rl];W[ql];B[qn];W[rm];B[po];W[rg];B[qh];W[ph]
;B[rf];W[rh];B[pb];W[qi];B[re];W[ml]C[Through W62, the local exchange comes to an end, as a result, White ends in gote and can't be satisfied.];B[eq]LB[fp:a]C[B63: Black should consider to approach the corner at 'a', this way if White jumps out, Black can answer at the top.];W[jp];B[kp];W[kq];B[jq]

;B[hp];W[ip];B[cr];W[br];B[gn]C[Black tries to break out of the encirclement with the sequence following B83.];W[gm];B[fm];W[go];B[en];W[hn];B[fo];W[fl];B[em]
;W[dr]C[White takes one stone in sente then ataris with W92, White can adequately fight.];B[gl]LB[er:a]C[B93: Black probably can only clamp at 'a', in the game White gets to crawl here, White is alive completely, Black gets into a bitter fight.];W[fk];B[gk];W[gn];B[eo];W[fj];B[ik];W[ir];B[kr];W[er]
;B[dk];W[dj];B[cj];W[di];B[fr];W[gp];B[gq];W[hq];B[ci]C[The crawl of B111 is a game-deciding move, which leads to a complicated fight.];W[ck];B[dl];W[bk];B[ch]

(;W[hj]LB[eg:a][cl:b][bj:c][eh:d][dh:e][dg:f][cg:g][bg:h][bh:i][ai:j][bf:k]C[W122: For White to fly out at 'a' is just not working, because after the sente move B 'b' and B 'c', Black can push and cut at 'd', next W 'e', B 'f', W 'g' and W 'h', B 'i' and W 'j', Black has a good clamp move at 'k', White is no good (see var a).];B[jl]LB[gj:a]C[Since Black is short by one liberty, with B123 Black can't push and cut at 'a'.]
;W[eg]C[The sequence following W124 leads to a ko fight.];B[im];W[in];B[dq];W[cq];B[ho];W[gr];B[gs];W[fq];B[eh];W[fs];B[gj]LB[cl:a][dm:b]C[In the process, Black has no other choice but to play B133 and B135, if Black can push and capture two stones by playing at 'a', it would be better, but when B 'a', White can reduce liberties at 'b', this way Black is one liberty short in the capturing race.]
;W[mk]C[Because Black has to capture by reducing liberties, after White extends out with W136, Black's situation is already no good, although Black fights bravely later on, but the difference between both sides is relatively big, Black is hard to turn the game around.];B[dh];W[cd];B[ec];W[eb];B[fb];W[db];B[jc];W[kc];B[kb];W[lb];B[jb];W[jd]
