;W[cn];B[kq];W[qj];B[qf];W[qm]LB[pn:a][qn:b][qo:c][lp:d][qg:e]C[So far the opening is almost same as the game between Cho Hunhyun and Chang Hao in recent Fujitsu Cup final, the difference is that Black makes small knight in the upper-right corner instead of the big knight at 'e', this somewhat restricts White from entering the corner at 3-3. In that game, after B 'a', Chang Hao played W 'b', next B 'c' and W 'd', and its result is not satisfactory.];B[pn]LB[qn:a][qo:b][ol:c][on:d][lp:e][pk:f][qg:g]C[As to the small knight in the upper-right corner, White can consider to reduce its efficiency, for example, White can play at 'a', next B 'b' and W 'c', after B 'd', White can make the shoulder-hit at 'e', allowing Black to fight by playing at 'f', this way the small knight is less powerful than at 'g'.]
;W[ro];B[rn];W[qn];B[qo];W[rm];B[rp];W[lp]C[Chang Hao first plays several moves on the right side then takes tenuki, this is the updated version of last game.];B[kp];W[lo];B[ko];W[ln];B[so]LB[qg:a]C[B23 taking one stone is inevitable.]
;W[pm];B[on];W[lq];B[kn];W[om]LB[qg:a]C[So far, Black takes one stone in the corner and becomes very thick, and Black's small knight is much more efficient than at 'a', this updated version is not good, Black is favorable in the opening.];B[fc];W[hc];B[cc];W[dc];B[cd];W[de];B[ce]
;W[df]LB[gd:a]C[This is Seo Bongsoo's relatively strong and crude play, putting emphasis on pulling out at 'a'.];B[cf];W[cg];B[bg];W[dg];B[bh]LB[he:a][gd:b][km:c][jm:d][jl:e][im:f][il:g]C[White certainly will not strengthen at around 'a' right now, Black's attempt is very obvious. White can first play hane at 'c', followed by B 'd', W 'e', B 'f' and W 'g', this way White can take control of center at one stroke, waiting for Black to fight at 'b'.]
;W[kc]C[W42: As to this, the two-space extension is not giving enough support to the coming fight.];B[km]LB[op:a]C[After Black sticks head out, the strength in the middle is reversed, although White can take advantage by playing at 'a', this is clearly not helpful to the fight.];W[op]LB[pq:a]C[W44 is indeed very big, later on White can make diagonal at 'a', if Black takes tenuki, Black will be forced to make life with two eyes, so normally it is sente.];B[gd];W[hd];B[gf];W[he];B[fb];W[eb]
;B[fg];W[di];B[fj]C[Black takes initiative in the fight.];W[cb];B[bb];W[ba];B[ab];W[dk];B[ig]LB[pq:a]C[Black is already clearly favorable and ends the fight in sente. White has to strengthen at the top and has no time to play at 'a'.];W[nc];B[ob]
;W[nb];B[oq];W[nq];B[or]C[B63 and B65 are huge moves.];W[fl];B[cj];W[ci];B[bj]C[B69 is a miserly move.];W[dj];B[cl];W[ck];B[bk]
;W[bi];B[cm]LB[aj:a]C[B75 is a good move, White dares not block crossover at 'a', Seo Bongsoo is very sharp in this kind of places.];W[dn];B[ai];W[dl];B[oc]C[B79 is also a very miserly play, if Black strengthens the center, White will not have any chance.];W[gh];B[hf];W[ii];B[kh]LB[jg:a][jf:b][kg:c][kf:d][lg:e][lf:f][mg:g][mf:h][ng:i][nd:j]C[If White crosscuts at 'a', next B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f', W 'g', B 'h', W 'i' and B 'j'.]
;W[fh];B[jj];W[nd]C[Now if Black makes life in the center, Black will win.];B[dr];W[cq]C[The play of W88 is too candid.];B[ij];W[qd]C[W90: White's game-deciding move is not successful, the following comments are omitted.];B[qe];W[qc];B[oe];W[pb];B[oa]
