;B[ok];W[oh];B[fo];W[dr];B[ce];W[kn];B[lp]C[The opening is very fast, White incurs loss in the exchange of W24 and B25, but on the outside White has the advantage of using W24 as ladder breaker.];W[dg];B[ee];W[fd];B[cc]C[With the attachment of B29, I don't have any special tactic (meaning favorable variations from personal study).];W[dd]
;B[cd];W[de];B[df];W[ef]LB[cf:a][bf:b][bg:c]C[W34: White should play atari at 'a', Black connects at 34, White can descend at 'b' or hang at 'c', this variation is better, I will be difficult to play.];B[cf];W[ff];B[bh];W[mc];B[kc];W[me]

;B[ja]LB[jb:a]C[B77: After study in post game, for Black to retreat crudely at 'a' is also working.];W[jb];B[la];W[kd];B[jd];W[ka];B[ld];W[ne];B[la];W[of];B[ka];W[lj]LB[pg:a]C[W88 is a very risky and unreasonable move, White should bump at 'a'.]
;B[ph];W[lh];B[oi];W[oj];B[qi]C[After B93, Black perhaps has more strong and unyielding plays, I didn't think it through at that time, it is worth study.];W[oh];B[pf];W[pg];B[nf];W[qh];B[qf]C[Through B99, White's situation is also bad.];W[hq]

In post game analysis, we played this variation, but Lee Sedol and I have the exact opposite opinion, I think I will lose, but he thinks he is not good.]
