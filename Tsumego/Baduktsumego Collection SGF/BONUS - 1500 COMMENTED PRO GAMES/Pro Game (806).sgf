Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[pd]C[Yu Bin is one good teacher who is deeply loved by young Go players. Although he always makes modest remarks on himself, but he owns the best record in the world tournaments among all Chinese players. As to our young players, he is always regarded as a very strict "ruler", only if you completely defeats him, you probably can reach to the top of the Go arena.];W[dd];B[pq];W[dq];B[do]

;B[pl];W[qq];B[qp];W[pp];B[il];W[hm];B[rp];W[ce];B[jd]C[Black's tenuki with B63 is vigorous!];W[cl]C[The invasion of W64 is normally the vital point that you have to strengthen, but in this game, Black surprisingly ignores it!];B[dg];W[cg]
;B[kk]C[B67: Black takes lightly the left side and plays tenuki again, it is a related move with B63 aiming at a big moyo fight.];W[pr];B[oq];W[rq];B[or];W[rr]LB[qh:a]C[W72 is small, White should invade at 'a'.];B[pf];W[dk]C[W74: Since there is no proper invasion point, White simply captures the left side completely, this is an extreme measure, it will easily lead to a big killing and managing situation.];B[qn]C[B75: White eliminates White's all uses for other purpose over here, it is necessary.];W[jg]C[The reduction of W76 is a little shallow, White should move one line deeper.]

;W[qd];B[pb]LB[od:a]C[B91 is too relentless! Connecting at 'a' can be satisfied. In the game, Black doesn't give a chance for White to live in the corner and forces White to live as a whole, Black has no assurance of success. But in the fast games, nobody can calculate precisely all variations, normally you can only think of one or two variations. Now if you can crush you opponent by momentum, your opponent may not dare fight a direct confrontation or doubt his own calculation, therefore making mistakes. In terms of the process of this game, Yu Bin 9p's play is more powerful!];W[qc];B[qb];W[od];B[nc];W[mg];B[mh];W[ng];B[nh];W[of];B[pe]

If White plays hane at 'a', comparing with the play in the game, White at least gets one more eye, this way White's big dragon wouldn't die.];B[ne];W[oe];B[jb]LB[ld:a]C[After Black descends with B121, in a hurry, White loses the chance of making an eye at 'a' with W124, instantly White's dragon has no way to escape.];W[mb];B[ob]
