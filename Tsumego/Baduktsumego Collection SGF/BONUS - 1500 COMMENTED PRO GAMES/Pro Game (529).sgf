;B[dp];W[cp];B[eq];W[cn];B[dr];W[cq];B[kq];W[np]C[The play of W14 is rarely seen.
];B[po];W[gq]C[After the invasion of W16, it leads to a fierce fight.];B[fo];W[go]
;B[gp];W[fq];B[ep];W[hp];B[fp];W[iq];B[ko];W[gn];B[em];W[io]C[When B27, White can't crosscut at 'a', but after W28, the crosscut becomes effective.]LB[en:a];B[fr]LB[er:a]C[B29: However, Black can play hane comfortably, and also indirectly guards against White's crosscut, since White can't cut at 'a'.]
;W[gr];B[dl];W[mn]LB[nn:a]C[The diagonal of B31 is a little slow, I spent a lot of time on this move. Perhaps Black still should make knight at 32 or cap at 'a' to seal off W14 one stone. In the game, I thought the diagonal of B31 is also not bad.];B[km];W[ml];B[jl];W[bl]LB[cr:a][kk:b]C[The diagonal of B35 is bad move. Black should first jump at 36, forcing White to make life at 'a', then Black can jump out at 'b'.];B[pl];W[gl]
;B[ej]C[B39 is also bad, its shape is not right.];W[ck];B[fm];W[im]LB[ek:a]C[After the diagonal of W40, White can crosscut at 'a'. To guard against crosscut, Black is forced to do the damaging exchange of B41 and W42. So far, Black's situation is already bad.];B[gj];W[hj];B[gi];W[hk];B[jj];W[lp];B[kp]
;W[pq];B[qq];W[mj];B[hi]C[W52 is slow, White should attach at 53.];W[ii];B[ij];W[ih];B[ki];W[gg];B[cl];W[bj]C[The exchange of B59 and W60 is damaging to territory, but Black is left with the tactic of making life, to prepare for the middle-game fight later on.
];B[hh]
;W[on];B[oo];W[lq];B[jn]LB[kn:a]C[After B53, White's big group makes life, but Black obtains many sente moves, originally White can wedge at 'a', now after Black peeps with B65, the wedge and cut at 'a' disappears naturally.];W[in];B[ig]C[With W62 White should retreat at 67. In the game,  after Black captures W54 and W56 with B67 and B73, Black's shape is thick, Black has no burden on the board.];W[ln];B[kn];W[kr];B[fc];W[if]
;B[jg];W[ic]C[B71: For Black to play at 74 instead is a little better, after the clamp of W72, the counterattack of W74 is inevitable. Next White handles lightly, Black takes some advantage locally but ends in gote.];B[kc];W[fe];B[hd];W[id];B[hf];W[gd];B[dc];W[cc];B[cd];W[de];B[bc]
;W[cb];B[bb];W[ce];B[bd];W[ec];B[db];W[eb];B[ca];W[qm];B[or];W[qf]C[After this move, it is time for lunch break.];B[qi];W[ql]
;B[qe];W[ph]C[The knight of W100 is good move! It is to my surprise.];B[qk]LB[pf:a]C[The play of B101 is a little risky, Black should hang at 'a', sacrificing one stone B97. In the game, Black plays with fire.];W[oj]C[White attacks with W102, Black's big group is dangerous!];B[pj];W[ok];B[oi];W[pi];B[qh]C[But when B103, W104 and B105, White loses chance with W106! If White blocks at 107 instead, Black perhaps will lose the game.];W[pg]
;B[pk];W[re];B[pm];W[qc];B[pc];W[qb];B[nc];W[pn];B[qn]C[In the game, Black crawls with B107, then Black captures two stones W94 and W98 with B111 and B117, the situation is close.];W[rk];B[rj]C[If Black blocks at 107 with B105, later on Black can only hang and atari at 106, but after the hane of W118, Black will be very difficult to handle.];W[om]
;B[rg];W[rf];B[qg]C[White's sequence following W116 is a big miscalculation, White's sequence following W118 is not sente, B123 is good move! White perhaps overlooks this move.];W[pf];B[fb]C[After obtaining sente, Black grabs the last biggest move on the board with B125, Black already can't lose this game. Later on, Black's advantage of 10+ points on the board was never changed.];W[he];B[ed];W[ee];B[pb];W[fd];B[ea];W[fs]
