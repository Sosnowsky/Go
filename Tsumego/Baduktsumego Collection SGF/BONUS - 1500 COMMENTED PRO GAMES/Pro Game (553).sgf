Translation:GoGameWorld.];B[pd];W[dd]C[Known as "Demon Women", Rui Naiwei is generally recognized as the strongest women player in the world! In my memory, only in the 2nd Bohae Cup, she lost in the final (her opponent is Feng Yun), in all other events which she participated, she never let anybody else get away with champions.];B[pq]C[ (In women's only tournaments, the previous statement is true, but in other events, she lost several times, for instance, she was beat for 3 times by her Husband Jiang Zhujiu in NAMTs, and he also lost three finals in Korea, to know the details, you can search all her runners-up in our title page!)];W[dp];B[fq]
;W[hq];B[cq];W[dq];B[cp];W[do];B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[eq];B[cn];W[pn];B[qp]C[B7 and B17: Black has adopted a territory-oriented strategy.];W[qf]

;W[qh];B[ne];W[nh];B[mg];W[oi];B[mc];W[mh];B[lh]LB[lc:a][mp:b]C[B39 is unreasonable, it is no better than extending at 'a', waiting for White to reinforce the right side with one move, then Black can jump to 'b' resolutely, leading to a moyo race, this is quite consistent with B7 and B17.];W[lc];B[mb];W[lg]C[The cut of W42 is severe!]
;B[kh];W[ld];B[nb];W[lf]C[White extends to W46, as a result, two black stones on the outside are isolated, White's position is vivid across the board.];B[pk];W[op];B[po]C[B47 and B49: Black stirs up a fight initially, it seems that she feels the situation is unfavorable for her, but Black itself has been cut into three pieces, the inadequacy of the fight is obvious.];W[oo];B[on];W[om];B[nn];W[qm]
;B[nk]LB[oj:a][mi:b][nm:c]C[B55 is mild, Black should tiger at 'a' bluntly, making a miai of the hane at 'b' and the turn at 'c', Black is sure to get one.];W[nm];B[mn];W[mm];B[ln];W[lm];B[mi];W[oj];B[ok];W[rk]C[White first destroys Black's eye shape with the extension of W62, then connects her two groups together with the knight's move of W64, this removes the future trouble for her and also leaves Black's two groups escape by themselves, White's advantage is self-evident!]
;B[rj];W[qk];B[pj];W[ri];B[qi];W[rh];B[lk]LB[lp:a]C[B71 is a losing move! it is hankering after petty gains. The few black stones on the right are already useless, and can be sacrificed, now Black should jump down at 'a' to first capture the two white stones on the right, staking the game on the center big dragon.];W[oq];B[pr];W[lp]C[After W74, Black sinks into an awkward situation: not only Black's shape is thin but also Black is falling behind in territory. Apparently, Black has totally failed in this fight.];B[kn]
;W[km];B[kp]C[B77: Black seeks a fighting chance.];W[kq];B[lq];W[lr]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.];B[mq];W[mp]C[W80 and W82 are calm and solid.];B[jq];W[kr];B[jr];W[jp];B[ko]
;W[nq]C[After W88, White has already lived, there is no more target for Black to tangle up.];B[ip];W[in];B[jn];W[jm];B[hp];W[gq];B[gp];W[fp];B[fo];W[fr];B[hn];W[dn]
;B[im]LB[cm:a]C[B101 is the last losing move, in any rate, Black should extend out at 'a'!  fighting desperately to the end is the only way for Black to have a chance to win.];W[il];B[hm];W[co];B[bo];W[bn];B[bp];W[cm]C[White ataris out with W102 and then takes one stone with the sequence up to 108, White wins the game for sure.];B[rn];W[rm];B[qn]
