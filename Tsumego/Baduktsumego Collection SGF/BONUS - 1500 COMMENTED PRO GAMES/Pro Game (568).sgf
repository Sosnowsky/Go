Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[pd]C[Lee Sedol's recent momentum is very strong, he defeated Choi Cheolhan by 2:0 in KBS Baduk Wang and won the champion. This is Lee Sedol's big turnaround game.];W[dd];B[pq];W[dq];B[do]
;W[co];B[cn];W[cp];B[fc];W[cf];B[dn];W[fq];B[dj];W[qf];B[nd];W[rd];B[db];W[ch]
;B[qc];W[qi]C[White's opening from B1 to W20 is successful.];B[qo];W[lc]C[Black also didn't play any bad move, the key is, Black's joseki in the lower left corner is not successful, and White gets to play W22 in the upper right corner.];B[ic];W[le];B[mc];W[kq];B[go];W[bj];B[hp];W[nq]
;B[og];W[ph];B[oh];W[je]C[The exchange of B33 and W34 is damaging for Black.];B[ko];W[hd]C[Following W36, White plays very smoothly.];B[hc];W[gd];B[fd];W[fe];B[gc];W[mb]
;B[nb];W[gf]C[Through W44, Black's situation is already falling behind.];B[no]C[B45: Black attacks strongly, but White already prepares for it.];W[op];B[pn];W[jp];B[jo];W[pp];B[qp];W[pr];B[qq];W[ip]C[W48, W50 and W54, these several crude moves appear very powerful now, they are good moves at this situation.]
;B[gq]C[The play of B55 is inevitable.];W[io];B[fr];W[fp];B[er];W[eq];B[fo];W[gp]LB[dr:a]C[W62: For White to play at 'a' is also playable.];B[hq];W[ho];B[dr]C[White separates Black, but after Black crawls with B65, White lives painfully in the corner.]
;W[cr];B[iq];W[jr];B[gs];W[bn];B[bm];W[an];B[gm];W[im];B[bk];W[or]C[B75 and W76 are miai good points.];B[qk];W[oi]
;B[ap]C[B79 is a careless move and should be preserved.];W[bo];B[bi]C[The original move of B81 is to reinforce the right side, but Black has no good way to reinforce.];W[pl]C[W82 is severe! Black suddenly sinks into a difficult situation.];B[pk];W[ol];B[ni]C[Since Black can't connect, Black counterattacks with B85, but it is really unreasonable.];W[qm]C[After White makes diagonal with W86, it seems Black is already about to collapse.];B[oj]C[Following B87, Black has no other alternative but to continue the game strongly.];W[pi]
;B[nk];W[nl];B[pg];W[qg];B[ri]C[B93 is tesuji, ...];W[rh]LB[rc:a]C[..., but with W94 and W 'a', White retreats a little, Black still can't handle the situation.];B[rj];W[rc]LB[ok:a]C[In the process, with W96 if White first squeezes at 'a', Black's situation is even worse.];B[ml]
;W[on];B[rb];W[qd];B[pc];W[ok]LB[mk:a]C[W102 is a big mistake! Only if White doesn't tight liberty but simply cut at 'a', the game will soon be over and White is winning.];B[ql];W[pm];B[rm]C[After B103 and B105, White unexpectedly can't block crossover, White incurs big loss in points and also loses a target to attack. In fact, there is not a big deal even if White doesn't reinforce at top.];W[oo];B[qn];W[md]C[White's moves following W108 are also bad!]
;B[nc];W[rl];B[sl];W[nh]LB[mm:a]C[W112: White is still fine if White plays hane out at 'a'.];B[nj];W[pe];B[me];W[ld];B[mh]C[In the game, Black captures one stone with B117, the situation finally has been turned around.];W[cb];B[cc]LB[dc:a]C[But immediately the play of B119 is overly zealous, Black should just bump at 'a', Black is simply favorable.]
;W[dc];B[bb];W[eb];B[ca];W[ec];B[cd];W[de];B[fb];W[ea];B[jb];W[kb];B[hb];W[mf]
;B[oe];W[of];B[ng];W[ne];B[od];W[pf];B[sb];W[ck]C[Since Black becomes thin as a whole, W140 appears very severe.];B[cj];W[bl];B[aj];W[cm];B[dk]
;W[cl];B[nn]LB[dl:a]C[B147 is a big bad move! Black overlooks White's push at 'a'.];W[mm];B[nm];W[om];B[lm];W[dl]TR[ap]C[After the crude push of W152, Black almost collapses again. We can see how bad the original move of B79 (marked stone) is!];B[fk];W[el];B[gj]
;W[fl];B[gl];W[hk];B[gk];W[fi];B[gi];W[fh];B[fj];W[ii];B[gh];W[mk];B[ll];W[lk]
;B[kk];W[lj];B[jm];W[kj]LB[jk:a]C[W172: White certainly should clamp at 'a' instead, Black has no answer.];B[jk];W[jj];B[pj];W[ik];B[jl];W[hm]C[Just when the victory is almost there, White plays several bad moves W172, W174, W176 and W180.];B[bh]
;W[bg];B[dh];W[be];B[bd];W[da];B[cb];W[dg];B[ci];W[rn];B[rk];W[ah];B[eh];W[fg]
;B[ei]C[Through B193, Black safely enters into endgame phase. White already can't win the game.];W[ek];B[ej];W[al];B[fm]C[This is Lee Sedol's good and very lucky game.];W[dp];B[ak];W[qr];B[rr];W[rs];B[sr]C[The following moves are omitted.

Lee Sedol defeated Choi Cheolhan by 2:0 and won the champion.])
