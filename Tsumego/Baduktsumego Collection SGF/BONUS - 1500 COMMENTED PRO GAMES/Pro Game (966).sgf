After being quiet for a while, recently this veteran seems to come back to life again.];W[dc]C[In the final game 2 of Judan title, Cho Chikun takes back and defeated Yamashita Keigo by resignation with 211 moves, leading the best-of-5 series by 2:0.];B[dq];W[pp];B[ce]

;B[fp];W[fo];B[go];W[br];B[bs]C[Generally speaking, Black can only play one of two hanes among B21 and B23, the play in the game is a new attempt, perhaps Black takes into account the good configuration in the upper left corner.];W[gp];B[ho];W[gq];B[fr];W[ip]LB[hp:a]C[The jump of W28 is interesting, if Black pushes at 'a', White will play by sacrificing.];B[fn]
;W[ds];B[cs];W[hp]LB[gn:a][en:b]C[W32 is to prepare for the cut at 'a', but in the real game, after White cuts at 'a', the fight is not to White's advantage. Therefore, W32 is a questionable move. White should wrap at 'b', the exchange of B29 and W 'b' is not to Black's advantage, this variation is simple and clear.];B[bq];W[bp];B[ar];W[gn];B[en];W[do];B[gm];W[hn]
;B[io];W[jo];B[in];W[hm];B[hl]C[B45 is a surprising strong move. White perhaps overlooks this move, White sinks into a bitter battle.];W[im];B[jn];W[gl];B[ko];W[jm];B[kn];W[kq];B[em]
;W[dm];B[el];W[dl];B[gk];W[km];B[mn];W[lm];B[mp];W[mr]C[Through W62, it seems White can only play this way.];B[dk]C[After Black plays the sente move of B63, overall Black starts to be favorable.];W[ck];B[dj]

;W[id]LB[ic:a]C[W92: White can only tolerate at 'a'.];B[fc];W[fb];B[ic]C[The cut of B95 is intense.];W[jc]C[Following W96, White is being pinned down all the way, Black easily converts advantage into victory.];B[ib];W[hb];B[jb];W[kc];B[kb];W[lc]
;B[lb];W[mc];B[ie];W[jd];B[mb];W[nc]LB[nb:a]C[W108: White very wants to play hane at 'a', but after Black's cut at 108, Black can kill White's big dragon in the center by sacrificing, White is also not good.];B[ha];W[gb];B[nb];W[cd];B[oc]C[After Black plays the hane of B113, Black is difficult to lose this game.]
;W[be];B[dd];W[bc];B[cf]LB[je:a]C[B117 is a conservative play in a favorable situation. Black can press at 'a' and take action first.];W[od]LB[kf:a][jg:b]C[W118: White can consider to make the knight's move at 'a', however Black can enclose territory at 'b', White is also hard to overturn the game.];B[pd];W[oe];B[je];W[qf]
;B[me]C[The strike of B123 is intense.];W[mf]C[Following W124, White is completely forced to answer and has no chance to counterattack.];B[lf];W[mg]C[Later on, White already has no chance to win.];B[lg];W[mh];B[li];W[lh];B[ki];W[kh];B[ji];W[jh]
