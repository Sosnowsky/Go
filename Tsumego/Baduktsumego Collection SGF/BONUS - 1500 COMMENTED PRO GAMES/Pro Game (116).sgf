(;W[eb]LB[ed:a][db:b][dd:c][bb:d]C[W14 is inevitable, if White pushes at 'a', then B 'b', W 'c' and B 'd', not only White would suffer territorial losses, and also White is still not thick (see var a).];B[fc];W[ed];B[dd];W[db];B[gc];W[gd];B[hc];W[bc]LB[hd:a][bb:b]C[W22: White can only elect to make life by this hane move, if White continues to press at 'a', then Black will kill the corner by playing at 'b'.]
;B[hd]LB[lc:a][bd:b][bb:c][eg:d]TR[oc]C[Although it is playable for Black to fight by sacrifice with the sequence after B23, up to the clamp of B 'a', the game is a little favorable for Black, However, if Black blocks at 'b', then W 'c' and B 'd', this would be more severe. Because the position of the marked black stone is far away, the fight should be definitely favorable for Black.];W[ff]LB[ef:a][ch:b][ee:c]C[W24: White wants badly to knight-cap at 'a', however if so, Black's attachment at 'b' would be a good move, because Black would be favorable in the ladder if pushing and cutting at 'c', so White couldn't initiate a direct confrontation with Black and has to look after himself first.];B[eg];W[ef];B[dg]

(;B[lc]LB[mc:a][oe:b][pf:c][of:d][pg:e][kc:f]C[B31 is reasonable. As far as state of the mind is concerned, Black should pincer more tightly at 'a', then W 'b', B 'c', W 'd' and B 'e', next White's counter-invasion at 'f' would be severe (see var a).];W[bg];B[bh];W[bf];B[dm]LB[dl:a]C[B35 is a bad move, it is more appropriate for Black to make the loose-pincer at 'a'.];W[eo]
;B[fp];W[dk]C[In the game, after the jump and the invasion of W36 and W38, Black has been cut into two parts and it is a little troublesome for Black.

(;B[di]LB[ck:a][fm:b][cm:c][dn:d][cn:e][do:f]C[B39: Black is overhasty! After being separated by W 'a' violently, both the upper and lower black groups appear cumbersome, so Black still should jump to 'b', if White crosses over at 'c', then B 'd', W 'e' and Black pierces through at 'f' (see var a).];W[ck];B[fm];W[fo];B[gp];W[go];B[hp]
;W[ho];B[io];W[in];B[hm]LB[jo:a]C[B49 is an overplay, Black should extend at 'a' to protect his territory first, after White kills anyone of Black's groups at the top, Black then could be relieved from this heavy burden.];W[jo];B[ip];W[hn];B[gj];W[fk];B[gh];W[gk];B[ij]

;B[rh];W[qn]C[In the game White gets to strike first on the right side with W78 and W80, Black is clearly one step slow.];B[ql];W[on];B[np];W[rk]LB[ri:a]C[In this crucial moment, W84 is weak! After the game, Liu Jing said, in the game he thought White would block at 'a', thus it would lead to a fierce fight.];B[qo];W[rn];B[qj]LB[qk:a][pj:b]TR[qi]C[B87 is a good move! White is already hard to handle. In the postgame analysis, Liu Jing thinks White now should push at 'a', B 'b', White then pushes out again to sacrifice the marked white stone without hesitation.]
;W[pj];B[qk];W[ri]C[W88 and W90: In the game, White is unwilling to give up anything.];B[pi];W[ph];B[oi];W[qh];B[oh]C[After Black fights by sacrifice with B91 and B95, White instantly sinks into an awkward position.];W[qg];B[rj];W[qf];B[nd]
;W[ok]LB[od:a][mn:b]C[W100 is rash, White should kill Black at 'a' first, then Black would definitely attack White at 'b'. Although this game would still favorable for Black, but the position is still not settled yet, White still has the chance to turn the game around.];B[od]C[W100: While White insists on pulling out his lonely stone, Black takes the chance to extort White in sente.];W[rd];B[pm];W[pn];B[nl]TR[ok][pj]C[Then Black captures the marked key stones with B103 and B105, momentarily Black has achieved an overwhelming superiority.];W[ol];B[om]
