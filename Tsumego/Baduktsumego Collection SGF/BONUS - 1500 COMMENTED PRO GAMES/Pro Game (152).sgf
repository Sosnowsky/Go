;B[gq];W[ep];B[jp]C[This opening is very popular and appeared many times in Gu Li and Lee Sedol's games.];W[cp]LB[bq:a]C[In the lower-right corner, Korean players must have some study, White immediately makes diagonal with W10. Now if White plays on the right side, Black will take the corner at 'a' right away.];B[qo];W[nc];B[pf];W[jd];B[cf]LB[cc:a][fo:b][dn:c]C[B15: For Black to enter the corner directly at 'a' is also possible, or Black can first make the knight's move at 'b', waiting for White to strengthen at 'c', then Black can approach the corner with B15. However, this way Black seems to help White reinforce territory, making Black very difficult to make a decision.]
;W[ce];B[df];W[fd];B[ci];W[ej];B[fh];W[eh];B[eg];W[dh];B[ch];W[dj];B[bf];W[go]C[After White makes the knight's move with W28, White's situation is not bad.]
;B[hd]LB[cd:a]C[B29: It seems Black should directly squeeze at 'a'.];W[ge]C[The exchange of B29 and W30 looks damaging.];B[cd];W[cc];B[bd];W[bc];B[de];W[ad];B[be];W[ec];B[jn]
;W[qj];B[ql];W[qh];B[rg]C[B43: Black can only snap away White's base.];W[qc]LB[pb:a]C[W44 entering the corner is inevitable, otherwise after Black jumps to 'a', Black's shape would be perfect.];B[pc];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[oc];W[re]
;B[qg];W[oh];B[nd]C[B53 is also inevitable, here Black can't allow White to play, otherwise Black as a whole will come under attack.];W[pr]LB[qq:a]C[After W54, Black faces choice. Luo Xihe and me think for Black to retreat at 'a' is stronger, in the real game White is left with the tactic of living the corner.];B[oq];W[qq];B[or];W[qp]LB[hq:a]C[However, whether White should make life the corner immediately is also debatable, An Choyoung worries if he doesn't make life now, later on he may never have a chance, but I feel with W58 White should attach at 'a', making the lower-right territory thicker in sente.];B[po]
;W[rr];B[mh];W[pl];B[pm];W[pk];B[om];W[mi];B[li];W[mj];B[bp];W[bq];B[gm]LB[fn:a][fm:b]C[B71 is slow and the losing move. We suggest Black should dive in at 'a' to destroy territory and fully utilize Black's thickness. In the real game White can be satisfied if just simply attaching at 'b' to enclose territory, Black will face the difficult problem of inadequate territory and is very hard to continue.]
;W[lh];B[dm];W[fm]C[After B73, the attachment of W74 is already one step slow.];B[fn];W[fl];B[do]LB[fo:a][gn:b][bo:c][bn:d]C[B77 is a little questionable, Black should directly push at 'a', White probably also can only capture B71 in a ladder at 'b', this way Black can reinforce at 'c' or 'd' later on.];W[gn];B[fo];W[hm]LB[fp:a]C[W80 is simple, if White blocks at 'a', the corner becomes ko, White also has some comprehension.]
;B[fp];W[mg];B[ld];W[bo]LB[kc:a][lc:b][he:c]C[W84 taking one stone is very big, but in fact White is not in a hurry to play it. Now on the board the vital point is at 'a', next B 'b' and W 'c', capturing B29, this is simple and White is favorable.];B[bn];W[ap];B[kh]LB[jc:a]C[B87 is the losing move! Black should attach at 'a', it is a huge move!];W[lg]
;B[lj]LB[gl:a][mk:b]C[Wang Xi made a big miscalculation. He thought after Black pressed with B89, with W90 White can only take B71 at 'a', this way Black can play hane at 'b' to enclose the big territory, this way Black's situation is not bad.];W[lk]C[But surprisingly W90 is a good move! It unexpectedly serves as ladder breaker!];B[kk];W[kl]C[After White plays double-hane of W92, ];B[ll];W[mk];B[jl];W[km];B[jm]LB[gl:a][hk:b]C[..., Black already can't escape B71 at 'a' with B97, now White can play at 'b' and wrap up in sente, then push through at 97, Black can't resist.]
;W[hk];B[lm];W[kj];B[jk];W[kc];B[lc];W[lb];B[mb];W[ro]LB[ps:a][os:b]C[W106 living the corner is questionable, White should descend at 'a', this is a basic skill. Black blocks at 'b', if White plays as in the real game, it makes a two-point difference.];B[rn];W[rp]
;B[ps];W[qr];B[ki]LB[he:a]C[B111: If Black attaches out at 'a', the game is also to White's advantage.];W[he];B[je];W[ie];B[nl]LB[kb:a][mm:b]C[B115: If Black takes W104 at 'a', White will clamp at 'b', Black is difficult to enclose territory and painful.];W[kb];B[kd]
