;B[ro]C[From W26 to B31, the play from both sides is strong and unyielding.];W[pl]LB[sn:a]C[W32 is the original move, to descend at 'a' is unreasonable.];B[on];W[pk];B[sn]LB[pm:a][om:b][nn:c]C[B35 is correct move, if Black wedges at 'a', White can play atari twice at 'b' and 'c', Black is not happy.];W[rd];B[cf];W[fc]

;B[gk];W[fj];B[gj];W[fi];B[gi];W[fh]C[Through W134, Black gains a lot.];B[ef];W[cj]C[W136 is good move, White forces Black to connect back in dame moves.];B[fe];W[de];B[ge];W[hd]
