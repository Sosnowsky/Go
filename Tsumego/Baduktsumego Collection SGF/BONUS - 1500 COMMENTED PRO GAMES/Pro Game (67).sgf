;W[hd];B[hc];W[jd];B[jc];W[ke];B[gd]C[The opening up to B23 is same as in the final game 1, it seems both sides are very confident .];W[lb]LB[qf:a]C[W24: Lee Changho starts to vary, in the game 1, he played at 'a'.];B[df]LB[qf:a]C[B25 is a positive move, Mok Jinseok apparently knows who is sitting in front of him, playing steadily equals to surrender. However,  for White to pincer at 'a' is still a threat to Black.];W[ef]
;B[ee];W[de];B[cf];W[eg]C[W30 is severe, Black faces a big challenge.];B[bd];W[dc];B[fe]C[The fight over this area becomes complicated, both players are facing challenges.];W[bc];B[dh];W[be];B[bf]LB[ad:a][je:b][if:c][hf:d][jf:e][fh:f][gg:g][ce:h]C[In this area Black aims at some tactics, for example, W 'a', B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e' and B 'f', White's two stones will be captured, this is the variation Choi KyuByung 9p assumed (see var a). If White jumps to 'g', then Black can capture one stone by playing at 'h', White is not comfortable.]

(;W[eh];B[ce];W[fb]LB[di:a][gf:b]C[White simply makes life with the knight's move of W40. As to W40, if Black plays at 'a', then W 'b', everything would be over for Black.];B[gg]C[To stick the head out with B41 is inevitable.];W[fi]LB[gi:a][di:b][ci:c][ch:d][cj:e][dg:f][bh:g][gj:h][hi:i]C[Although the shape of W42 is a little weird, but it is a good point, if Black attaches at 'a', then W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 'e', W 'f', B 'g', W 'h' and B 'i', White's pace is good (see var a).]

(;B[di];W[hi]LB[hh:a]C[W44: Sealing off Black strongly by playing at 'a' may not be good, since White himself also has some defects.];B[gb]C[B45 is absolutely sente, Black probes White, here White is easy to make life, but making life and also reducing Black's eye shape is relatively complicated.];W[eb]LB[kb:a][ig:b][ib:c][qf:d][bb:e][ac:f][cb:g][cc:h][fa:i][ba:j][ca:k][ea:l][ec:m]C[W46: White doesn't want Black to live easily, but Black can ensure eye shape by playing the diagonal extension at 'a', White in the upper left is still not alive, perhaps after White exchanges B 'a', W 'b' and B 'c', White will grab the point at 'd' to attack Black in the upper right, if Black dares to attack, for example, B 'e', W 'f', B 'g', W 'h', B 'i', W 'j', B 'k', W 'l' and B 'm', Black also needs to pay a price.]

In the game 1, Black takes some advantage by using this kind of fierce moves, but in this game, White at the top is very thick, the situation is different.];W[ol];B[pb];W[pc];B[qc];W[rb];B[ob];W[nc];B[rc];W[sb]C[Black wants to make eyes in sente.]
