Liu Xing is the most "hottest" player this year, he didn't taste any defeat in the past 3 months, moreover, in the recent semi-final of Liguang Cup, I lost to him.];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[fq]
;W[hq]C[The purpose of the one-space low pincer of W6 is to break up the position. Due to the last complete loss, I decided to be more careful and play thicker moves, then seek chances to strike back.];B[fc]LB[cf:a]C[B7: For Black to approach the corner at 'a' is more popular, but Liu Xing is not a stickler for usual plays, this is where I admire him more.

;B[cn];W[qo];B[ql];W[op];B[oq];W[np];B[nq];W[mp];B[lq];W[qi];B[ol]LB[qg:a]C[B27: Black really wants to check at 'a', but this will immediately lead to a fierce fight, because White is relatively thick on the left side, so the fight is not favorable for Black.];W[qf]
;B[ml];W[nc];B[pf];W[pe]LB[pg:a][qe:b]C[W32 is a strong move, if White hanes at 'a', after White's tiger at 'b', White's shape seems over-concentrated.];B[oe];W[qe];B[oc];W[of];B[pg];W[ne];B[od]
;W[nd];B[qd];W[rd];B[rc];W[re];B[nb];W[nf];B[ph];W[rb]LB[lc:a][qh:b]C[The clamp of W48 is unnecessary, I thought it was a good move in the game, but I have overlooked Black's knight's move at 'a'. In fact, White only needs to attach back at 'b', then Black would be favorable.];B[lc];W[pi]
;B[oh]LB[nh:a][qh:b][oi:c]C[B51 is a bad move, Black should jump to 'a', if White still plays at 'b' as in the game, then Black can hang at 'c', this makes a big difference.];W[qh];B[oi];W[kd];B[pb];W[ld];B[sc];W[qc];B[qb];W[sd]
;B[pc];W[sb];B[mc];W[kc];B[qc];W[pk];B[lf];W[kb];B[pl]LB[oj:a][rj:b]C[B69 is not good either, Black should extend to 'a', after W 'b', Black can strike first in the upper left corner, this is much superior to the game play.];W[rj];B[nj]
;W[ec];B[fd];W[kf];B[fg];W[hf]C[W76 is a good move! Black not only strengthens himself and also forces Black to "sell out" the aji in the upper left corner.];B[de];W[ce];B[cc];W[ed];B[eb];W[db];B[fb];W[cb]
;B[ee];W[cd];B[dg];W[df];B[ef];W[eh];B[eg];W[ch]C[After White sticks his head out, the game is a little favorable for White.];B[qq]LB[lp:a]C[B93 is incomprehensible, it can be said that this is the losing move! Black should attach at 'a' and force White to live on the spot, then attack White on the left side, although it is not that good either, but there are still many unsettled places on the board.];W[nm];B[mm]
;W[mn];B[ln];W[mq];B[mr];W[kq];B[lr];W[lp];B[kp];W[lo]C[The sequence from W94 to W104 is my most proud moves, after these moves, White has already established himself in a winning position.];B[kg];W[jg];B[jf];W[ke]
;B[kh];W[ge];B[ko];W[kn];B[lm];W[nl];B[jn];W[ok];B[nk];W[on];B[fe];W[gh];B[dh]
;W[km];B[lk];W[ci];B[ig];W[hg];B[jh]LB[qn:a][mg:b]C[B125 and B127 are the last losing moves, Black can only attach at 'a' and try to rescue his three stones in order to keep balance in territory.];W[hc];B[ie];W[gd];B[di];W[gj]
;B[hi];W[gi];B[dk];W[jm];B[in];W[im];B[hn];W[hm];B[gn];W[fl];B[jq];W[dj];B[ej]
;W[cj];B[fh];W[mg]C[After the diagonal move of W148, the well-being of Black's center dragon is questionable, Black has to reinforce.];B[ik];W[gm];B[rn]C[B151: Black puts up a last-ditch struggle.];W[qn]LB[ro:a][po:b]C[W152: If Black blocks at 'a', then after Black attaches at 'b', White's whole group will die, the game would be turned around. White's ensuing moves are accurate and flawless, on the right side, Black can only create a two approach ko, the game for Black is as good as lost.
