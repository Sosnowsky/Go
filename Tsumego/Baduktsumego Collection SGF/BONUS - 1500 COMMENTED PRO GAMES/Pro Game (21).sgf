In this game, Karigane Junichi took Black without komi, time limit is 16 hours each side, the game was suspended for a total of six times. Shortly after the opening, White managed to kill the whole black group, both sides were involved in an extremely dangerous and fierce battle which directly affected the outcome of the game. At that time, the game had drawn close attention of so many go fans, causing a stir in Japanese Go world.];B[qd];W[qp];B[od];W[dc];B[do]LB[co:a]C[At that period, B5 was also often played at 'a'.]
;W[dq];B[cq];W[cr];B[cp];W[er];B[ck];W[op];B[ce]LB[qj:a][jc:b]C[B13: Black can also take the big point at 'a', next if White protects the corner at 13, Black can make an extension at 'b', forming a big moyo that stretches both directions in the upper right.];W[qj];B[gc]LB[gd:a][ed:b]C[Through B15, nowadays most players will elect to pincer attack at 'a', or make a knight-press at 'b', then jump to 'a'.]
;W[ed];B[dg];W[cd];B[de];W[bd];B[qh];W[kc]LB[jc:a][lc:b]C[After Black takes the big point on the right with B21, the splitting move of W22 is thoughtful, normally White will play at 'a', but this way Black would be left with an excellent point at 'b'.];B[ql];W[ph]
(;B[qg];W[ok]LB[qi:a][pj:b][pi:c][oj:d][oi:e][nj:f][nm:g]C[W24 and W26 are good judgement worth praising. With B25, Black can also play at 'a', then W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 'e', W 'f' and B 'g', this way Black would be more initiative and Black can adequately fight (see var a).];B[om];W[pm]LB[qi:a]C[W28 is obviously treated as a sacrificing stone, this shows White wants to develop the center, the conception with the ensuing sequence is magnificent. Perhaps because of different style, Sakata Eio 9p thinks White still should simply reinforce at 'a'.];B[pl]
;W[ol];B[pn];W[nm];B[qm];W[nn];B[rj]C[The crossover with the attachment of B35 is inevitable.];W[eo]C[W36: White expands his right side moyo at the maximum limit.];B[en];W[fo];B[fq];W[dp];B[dn]
;W[ip]C[B39 seems too formalistic to the joseki, after the exchange of W40 and B41, White gets to take the good point at 42, White's moyo at the bottom is tremendous, White becomes initiative.];B[jq]C[Black bravely invades with B43, this shows that Black is not optimistic about his situation, thus starts a war of attack and defense.];W[iq];B[ir]LB[jp:a][jo:b][io:c][jn:d][fn:e][mq:f]C[B45 seems a little unreasonable, Black should play at 'a', then W45, B 'b', W 'c' and B 'd', this way, 'e' and 'f' becomes miai, Black is sure to get one, this would be simple and clear and also the situation is easier for Black to control.];W[jp]C[As to B45, the turn of W46 is a strong move.];B[kr]LB[kq:a][hr:b]C[B47: Black can only make a tiger's move, if Black retreats at 'a', then White will block at 'b', Black is hard to tolerate.]
;W[kq];B[jr];W[lq]C[W50 shows White wants to kill all black stones at the bottom.];B[lr];W[mr];B[hq];W[hp]
(;B[gp]LB[gq:a][fr:b][gr:c][gs:d][hs:e][fs:f][mq:g]C[B55 is a strong move which leads to an extremely complicated situation. If Black connects at 'a', Black can simply make life, because after W 'b' and B 'c', White dares not play the hane at 'd', otherwise after B 'e', W 'f' and B 'g', White would be in danger of collapse on the outside (see var a). In the game, Black is worried that White may make a big territory in the center.];W[go]C[After B55 and W56, Black already can't live at the bottom, however White has a few cut points on the outside, White is also risky.];B[mq];W[nr];B[fr];W[hr]
;B[gq];W[fs]C[W60 and W62 to destroy Black's eye are inevitable.];B[gs];W[ls]LB[dl:a][cl:b]C[As to W64, Shusai Meijin thought after the game, White should first exchange W 'a' with B 'b', then play W64, this way White would be favorable in the capturing race.];B[hs];W[ks];B[ep];W[br];B[gr];W[js]
;B[kp]C[The sequence from B71 to B99 is inevitable, both sides are all very dangerous, and both sides don't have route of retreat either.];W[lp];B[ko];W[jo];B[nq];W[or];B[ms];W[ns];B[ho];W[hn];B[jn];W[io];B[in]

;W[hk];B[gj];W[bm];B[ak];W[bn];B[co];W[ap]LB[aq:a][ar:b][am:c][jk:d]C[Because of the mistake of B129, after W132 and W134, the striking move of W136 is excellent, Black can't block at 'a', otherwise after W 'b' and B 'c', White could get to play at 'd' first.];B[jk]C[Black has no choice but to make the knight's move of B137.];W[aq]C[With W138, White has not only saved one stone and also has extended his liberties, as a result, Black can only make seki at the bottom only if Black has sufficient ko threats. So far, White's situation is optimistic.]

;B[rk];W[pi];B[qf];W[fd]LB[og:a]C[W188: White doesn't connect at 'a', because White himself also has defects, Black can use White's defects to make life or introduce a capturing race.];B[gd];W[ge]LB[ic:a][he:b]C[The push and cut of W188 and W190 are questionable, incurring Black's strong resistance.
