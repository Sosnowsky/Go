Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[The game 3 of the best-of-7 series in Honinbo title match is very important, is one side going to dominate and win all the way? Or the other side starts to strike back?];W[dp];B[cd];W[pp];B[ec]
;W[ci];B[od];W[qj]C[Through W8, the opening is unique, Black becomes thick and White's pace is fast and light.];B[cn];W[co]LB[cl:a][cq:b]C[W10: In Korea, White most likely will pincer at 'a', allowing Black to enter the corner at 'b', this is one difference in Go arena between Japan and Korea, and it is hard to judge which one is better or worse.];B[dn];W[fq];B[ck]C[The sequence from B9 to B13 is Yoda's favorite.];W[cf];B[dg]C[The set pattern following B15 almost becomes joseki.]

;B[ef]LB[bl:a]C[B29 is Yoda's thick play, but it is questionable, normally Black will play the double hane at 'a'.];W[bj];B[ee];W[kc]C[After White plays the good splitting move of W32, Black seems to have accomplished nothing.];B[ic];W[ib];B[jb];W[jc];B[kb];W[mc];B[hb]
;W[id];B[hc];W[lf]C[After W42, White takes the lead in the opening.

After this move, it is time for noon break.];B[qh];W[np]LB[pn:a]C[W44: White can also consider to jump to 'a'.];B[ro];W[qp];B[ql];W[oj];B[ol];W[oh]LB[ok:a][om:b][oi:c][mm:d][kp:e]C[W48 and W50 are steady moves, with W48 White wants to play at 'a', if Black answers at 'b', then W 'c' will form a good shape, when Black jumps to 'd', White can answer at 'e', White's shape would be more vivid this way.]
;B[ml];W[kp];B[ng]C[B53 is strong, aiming to separate White.];W[qg];B[rg];W[ne]C[W56 is alert! White makes himself thick successfully by sacrifice.];B[og];W[ph];B[pg];W[qf];B[rh];W[pf]

;W[nm];B[nl];W[io]LB[kq:a]C[W78: White should descend at 'a'. White is thick on the whole board, giving White komi would become Black's heavy burden.];B[gp];W[fp];B[gq];W[go];B[kr];W[lr]C[After this move, the game was closed for the first day.];B[fr];W[er]
;B[hr]C[With B85 and B87, Black creates the aji of a ko, then makes life on the left side.];W[fs];B[lq];W[kq];B[mr];W[jr];B[ls];W[jq];B[oq];W[op];B[nq];W[pr];B[pq]

;W[kl];B[es];W[rk]C[After White captures the three black stones with W126 and W128, White turns favorable for the game.];B[eo];W[fn];B[do]LB[bo:a][ep:b][cq:c][dq:d][qi:e]C[After B131, White should descend at 'a', next B 'b', W 'c' and B 'd', this way even if White takes tenuki, Black is hard to kill White in the corner completely. Next White can strengthen and atari at 'e', the counter-sente move is very big, White is favorable.];W[fg]C[W132 is the losing move!

After this move, it is time for noon break.]
;B[hg];W[eg];B[gh]C[The counterattack of B133 and B135 is severe.];W[gf];B[pj]LB[qk:a][ok:b][lh:c]C[After W136, B137 is good timing, making White difficult to make a decision and connect at 'a', that way Black's cut at 'b' is sente, next Black's cut at 'c' is also sente, threatening White at the top.];W[pk];B[qi];W[ok]LB[qk:a]C[The connection of W140 is solid, but it is a move that makes White falling behind in the game. Now the game is already not to White's advantage. White should connect at 'a' to fight for a win.]
;B[fk]C[White is frustrated in the game, perhaps White still have a favorable consciousness just at the moment when White's situation makes a worse turn. Yoda strongly comes back from behind.];W[ed];B[de];W[if];B[hj];W[gm];B[gk];W[dq];B[bo];W[bq];B[cr];W[bp];B[dr]
