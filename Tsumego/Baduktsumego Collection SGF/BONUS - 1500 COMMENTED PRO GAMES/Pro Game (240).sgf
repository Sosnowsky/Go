;W[cq];B[dl];W[ck];B[do];W[df];B[dg]LB[dk:a]C[B19: Black must invade immediately, otherwise if White turns at 'a', White's shape would be too good.];W[cg];B[ch];W[dh];B[eg];W[ci];B[cf]
;W[bh];B[bg];W[ch];B[de];W[ce];B[ef]C[B31: Black takes one stone and can be satisfied, because the distance for White's stones on the left is narrow, even though White can take one stone, it would be not very powerful.];W[bf]
(;B[cd]LB[dc:a][df:b][ed:c][ee:d][fe:e][kc:f][mc:g]C[B33: Black immediately initiates the ko and is overhasty. Now Black should calmly attach at 'a', followed by W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 'e', W 'f' and B 'g', thus Black would be thick and also could profit by attacking White (see var a).];W[df];B[ep];W[ee];B[eq];W[gd]LB[ec:a][fe:b][fb:c][fd:d][gb:e]C[W38 is a common play, but it is not a good move in the current situation. White should attach at 'a' to first take the corner territory. If Black hanes at 'b', White could tenuki, even if White hanes at 'c', B 'd' and W 'e', Black as a whole would still be under White's attack.]
;B[dc];W[bd];B[ed]C[B39 and B41 are good move!];W[de]C[W42: White has to connect painfully.];B[hb];W[ib];B[gb];W[jc];B[bb]LB[ec:a]C[Next with the sequence of B43 to B47, Black lives by making 7 points of territory, comparing with White's taking the corner at 'a', the difference for both sides is huge.];W[qo];B[op]
;W[er];B[fp]LB[dr:a]C[However B51 is emotion-driven! Black should simply capture White at 'a'.];W[gr];B[hq];W[hr];B[iq];W[ir];B[gq];W[fr];B[jq];W[jr];B[kr]
;W[kq];B[lr];W[dq]C[In the game, White crawls to make life with the sequence from W52 to W64, Black has not only ruined Black's territory, and also Black has left Black the cut point. What's the most crucial is, Black's thickness can not be utilized in front of White's thickness! This equals to simply losing territory, Black instantly turns into an unfavorable situation.];B[qk];W[kp];B[go];W[mq];B[mr]LB[lq:a][lp:b]C[B69 lacks consideration. Black should first push at 'a' to exchange for W 'b', then crawls at 69.];W[nq];B[nr]
;W[oq]LB[lq:a][lp:b][or:c][pr:d][pp:e]C[While White squeezes with W72, because Black doesn't exchange B 'a' for W 'b', Black couldn't block at 'c' and can only retreat to 'd', after White cuts at 'e', White gets a lot of maneuvers to make sabaki plays.];B[pr];W[pp];B[oo];W[nn];B[on];W[or];B[os]
;W[qq];B[qr];W[no];B[rq];W[om]C[The moves from W76 to W84 is a sequence of nice play! Black couldn't resist and can only hole up inside.];B[po];W[ql]LB[pn:a][qp:b][np:c][nk:d]C[However, W86 is inexplicable! Kong Jie 7p thinks, White needs only to atari at 'a', then B 'b', W 'c', B 74 and W 'd', this way White would not only have reduced Black's territory but also have reinforced himself, White would be already simply favorable.];B[nm]C[After Black cuts White with B87, it leads to a chaotic fight.]

;B[qi]LB[kj:a]C[B101: Black should first play at 'a' to threaten White, this would contain White's development in the center.];W[jj]C[After White takes the vital point with W102, White has encircled a big territory in the center.];B[ri];W[nj];B[mj];W[nk];B[mn];W[mi];B[lo];W[nh]C[W110: It is simple for White to fight by sacrificing.];B[pf]

Black should play at 'a' to kill White, this way the outcome of the game is still hard to imagine.]
;W[hn];B[gn];W[mf]TR[jg]C[After White separates with W152, the marked black stone instead gets killed, Black therefore has incurred a big defeat.];B[hk];W[gj];B[ho];W[ne];B[lh];W[kh];B[li];W[kg];B[mg]
