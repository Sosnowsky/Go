Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[pd]C[Cho U's performance in Japanese Go scene is very good recently, but only once he entered into the final of international tournaments, this is LG Cup final which will take place in just a few days.];W[dd];B[qo]C[B3 is a trend.];W[op]C[W4: White is not tangling with Black.]
;B[pq]C[Black takes territory with the sequence following B5.];W[oq];B[pr];W[dq];B[kq];W[on];B[po];W[oo];B[hq];W[qm]C[But the pincer of B9 is inconsistent, up to the knight's move of W14, Black's stones are too loose and not efficient.];B[co]TR[dq]LB[qk:a][do:b]C[The corner-approach of B15 has little affect on the marked white stone (W8), but to play at around 'a' on the right side seems to follow White's footstep, this shows with the earlier B9 for Black to approach the corner at 'b' is just the right move.]
;W[qf];B[pi];W[or]C[As to the pincer of B17, the asking move of W18 makes Black painful.];B[qk]LB[rm:a]C[Black counterattacks with B19, aiming to attach and cross over at 'a'.];W[pp];B[qp];W[rr];B[rq];W[pk]LB[rn:a]C[But after exchanging two moves with W20 and W22, White attaches with W24, Black is difficult to answer, perhaps with B19 Black can only tolerate by playing the diagonal at 'a'.]
;B[ql]C[The sequence following B25 are crude moves to obtain sente.];W[pm];B[rm];W[rn];B[rl];W[qn];B[qr];W[pl];B[qi];W[nc];B[nd]LB[qc:a][oe:b][od:c]C[White gets to first double approach with W34, now B35 is too weak, and it is the losing move of this game! Now Black certainly should make the diagonal at 'a', if White dares seal off by playing the knight's move at 'b', Black can push and cut at 'c' to initiate a fight. In the game, it is hard to imagine White gets to enter the corner and settle the shape in sente.]
;W[md];B[ne];W[qc];B[oc];W[qd];B[mc];W[cj];B[ep]LB[bp:a][bq:b]TR[dq]C[The press of B43 is also slow, allowing White to take territory happily at 'a', here Black certainly should consider to fly in by playing at 'b', attacking the marked white stone.];W[eq];B[fp]
;W[fq];B[gp];W[bp];B[fc];W[df];B[pb];W[rh];B[ri];W[qb];B[cc]C[B55 entering the corner is the game-deciding move.];W[dc];B[db];W[eb]
;B[cb];W[ec];B[be];W[bf];B[ce];W[cf];B[fb];W[cd];B[bd];W[de]C[W66 and W68 are calm moves!];B[ea];W[ic];B[fe]
;W[lc];B[nb];W[he]C[Next W70, W72 and W74 are light.];B[fg];W[lb];B[cp];W[cq];B[bo];W[rs]C[W80 is an asking move.];B[ro];W[ps]C[White crosses over with W82, leaving half eye.];B[sn]
;W[ae];B[ac];W[cl]C[When White makes the extension of W86, clearly White is already favorable in the game.];B[dh];W[ci];B[hb];W[hc];B[ib];W[jb];B[gc];W[kf];B[ch];W[bh]
;B[ie]C[B97 is a tesuji.];W[gd]C[But W98 is a crude move to get out of trouble.];B[je];W[jc];B[fd];W[ig]C[Through W102, White seals off two stones, Black again incurs loss.];B[ld];W[kd];B[me];W[ke];B[ln]C[B107: Black hopes to enclose territory by attacking.]
;W[lq]C[But with the attachment of W108, White is not soft-hearted.];B[lp];W[kr];B[lr];W[mq];B[jr];W[kp];B[ks]LB[jq:a][lo:b]C[B115: If Black connects at 'a', White will wedge and atari at 'b', White will happily win the game. In the game, Black has no choice but to initiate the ko, but the ko is light to White and heavy to Black.];W[jq];B[hf]
