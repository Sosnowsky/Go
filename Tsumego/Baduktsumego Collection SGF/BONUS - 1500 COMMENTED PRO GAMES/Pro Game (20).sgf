;B[qh];W[qm];B[pl];W[ql];B[pj];W[pk];B[ok];W[qk];B[pi];W[ol];B[nk]C[The opening up to B17 was once used by Lee Changho against Wang Xi in Nong Shim Cup. At that time, Black achieved a very good result, in this game Lee Changho elects to play this opening again, obviously it was well prepared. The only difference from that game is, W4 was at the star point.];W[om];B[jc]
;W[mq]C[W20: White starts to vary, this is one move that Zhou Heyang stressed while analyzing Wang Xi's game.];B[nr]C[It is unclear whether the exchange of W20 and B21 is good or bad.];W[pc]LB[qc:a]C[With the attachment of W22, White is not satisfied with being pressed if entering the corner at 3-3.];B[qc];W[oc]C[This game proceeds very fast, clearly Zhou Heyang also had spent some time to study this opening, however not sure whether his study or Lee Changho's in this opening is deeper.];B[qb];W[ne]LB[od:a]C[W26: For White to turn at 'a' is rather common.];B[mc]C[After Black strikes with B27, White's shape seems a little restricted.]
;W[pe];B[od];W[nd];B[oe]C[Black starts to counterattack.];W[of];B[qd];W[nc];B[nf];W[lc];B[fc];W[cf];B[mf];W[le]
;B[kg]C[B37, B39 and B41 are simple and clear moves.];W[je]C[During the game process, White's upper group and right side are all relatively restricted, however Black first obtains two big corners. Although the situation is still too early, but Black first gets some territory and should be more comfortable to play.];B[kd]C[B43 is an asking move.];W[lf]C[W44 is the strongest counterattack.

];B[ld]LB[lg:a]C[B45 is strong and unyielding, Black can also consider to block at 'a'. The following exchange is inevitable from both sides.

];W[lg];B[me];W[md];B[ng];W[kb]
;B[mb];W[jb];B[nb];W[ic]LB[jd:a]C[W54: White can also squeeze at 'a', in the game, after the exchange of Black's territory vs. White's outside influence, it seems White is not bad, how to covert "check" into "cash" is White's future task.];B[db];W[cc];B[ed];W[gb];B[de];W[ce];B[dc];W[cd]
;B[ff];W[jd]C[Now W64 makes Black very painful, if White strikes first at the bottom, White is not bad, if Black takes tenuki, Black will give up what he struggled to capture earlier on. So B53 is inexplicable, clearly Black should retreat at 54. This exchange is clearly not to Black's advantage.];B[cn]C[B65: After painful decision making, Black elects to prolong this war by playing B65 on the left side, Black absolutely can't answer at the top, therefore W64 is White's wishful thinning. White should strike first.
];W[cl];B[cq]LB[hc:a]C[W66 is inevitable, now comparing with White attacks first, at the bottom this makes a huge difference. However if W64 is omitted, when Black needs to make life, Black can clamp at 'a'.];W[cp];B[dp];W[bq];B[cr];W[do];B[ep]
;W[co];B[br];W[eg]C[The attack of W76 is inevitable. Now if Black again gets to strike first, White's thickness can't be utilized.];B[fg];W[ef];B[ee];W[fh];B[gh];W[gi]LB[fi:a]C[W82 is unnecessary, White can simply extend at 'a', the situation will be simple and clear, White is favorable.];B[df];W[dg]
;B[cb]C[The counterattack of B83 and B85 are good moves, the situation again becomes a little chaotic.];W[bb];B[ba];W[bc]C[Black is calculating whether he can pound at White's weakness on the left side. If there is no loophole, White is favorable.

After this move, it is time for lunch break.];B[eh];W[fi];B[cg];W[dh];B[bf];W[be];B[bg]C[B93 and B95 are regarded as the strongest moves from the study room. Sure enough, Lee Changho plays it out!];W[di]LB[cj:a][ad:b][dj:c][ab:d]C[W95 is the only move, for Black to play at 'a' is strong and unyielding! Next W 'b', B 'c' and W 'd', this way with two white groups, Black must kill one, and even if the left side can be killed, White has to worry about not paying too much price. Now because of the overplay of W82, White's situation is not optimistic. If Black plays at 'b', it is seki and Black takes sente, not sure whether Lee Changho dare play at 'a' or not, as to this, both sides have no assurance of success.]
;B[ad]C[Now even if White can make seki in sente, the game is also to Black's advantage, because White's basic territory is already exploited terribly by Black.];W[ch];B[ae];W[ab];B[bh];W[bi];B[af];W[ah];B[ca];W[ai];B[fb]C[Looking back, Lee Changho grabs the chance of the unreasonable W82, comparing W82 with a move at 90, the difference in territory is huge! From the earlier advantage, now White is not easy to play.];W[fo]
;B[eo];W[en];B[eq];W[dn]C[Now White is very thick on the board, but White's territory is inadequate. Lee Changho is very good at Black in this situation. Facing with Lee Changho whose endgame is first-rated in the world, White's situation is not optimistic.];B[pb]LB[gp:a]C[B113 is huge, the common feeling is to jump out at 'a'. But perhaps Lee Changho thinks White is not easy to enclose the middle territory, so he elects to take cash first.
];W[gq];B[mr];W[kq]C[W114 and W116: White has no other alternative.

];B[iq]C[B117 is Lee Changho's top-rated feeling, White is very painful.];W[er]C[The sequence following W118 is roughly acceptable.]
;B[fr];W[gr];B[dr];W[ir];B[jl]C[After judgement, Black elects to play in the center with B123, which makes White very painful. Now if White strongly encloses the middle territory, White's points will be still inadequate, but to capture is really not easy. After Black settles the shape with several simple and accurate moves, Black is favorable in the game.];W[ll]C[W124 is the only move.

];B[jn]C[B125 is common, Black can consider to play one line to the right.

];W[ln];B[kk];W[mj];B[li];W[mi]
;B[hh]C[B131: Black perhaps should first play in the middle.

];W[ji]C[W132 is sharp! Black has no easy way to get out of the trouble, the situation again becomes chaotic.];B[go];W[fn];B[hi];W[rp]C[W136 probes Black, it is good timing.];B[rq]C[B137: Black can only retreat.

];W[qo];B[pp];W[ik]C[W140: White maybe have miscalculated, however White may be confident about his endgame skill, preparing to win the game in endgame.

];B[ij]
;W[hk]LB[jj:a][jk:b][jh:c]C[W142: White can't push and cut at 'a', otherwise after Black cuts at 'b', the atari at 142 and the bump at 'c' become miai.];B[jj];W[lj]C[W144 appears crude.];B[kj];W[im];B[jm];W[in]LB[rh:a][hm:b][io:c][gj:d][hj:e][lr:f]C[W148: If White grabs the biggest game at 'a', Black is left with the clamp at 'b' on the left side, but the play in the game is inexplicable, after Black's hane at 'c', does White have any good answer? If White takes tenuki, Black can invade at 'd'.

W148 is miscalculation, White can only squeeze at 'e', this makes W144 more like a crude move. If White doesn't play W144, W 'e' would be still sente.

With W148, White incurs loss of about one move! If White plays at 'f', the game is still very close.]
;B[io]C[I think, now the game is close and slightly to Black's advantage.];W[hj]LB[jo:a][ho:b][jq:c]C[W150: White can't cut at 'a', B 'b' and 'c' are all sente.];B[il];W[hl];B[jq]LB[lh:a]C[Now Black's advantage is already very big. Since even if Black strengthens back at 'a', it will be still a very big endgame. However White already spent one extra move with W148 and W150, it is too small.];W[jr];B[lr]C[B155 is a good move, Black again obtains points in sente.]
;W[kp];B[gn];W[gm];B[ho];W[hm];B[jo];W[rh];B[rg];W[ri];B[oh];W[ro];B[aa];W[ag]
;B[kr];W[fp];B[lh];W[oj]LB[rf:a]C[W172 is a good move, after this move, the clamp at 'a' is working.];B[cj]C[Black's play is very steady. White's territory is not enough and White's center is still a little weak.];W[ci];B[nj]LB[hb:a]C[It is too big if Black gets to play at 'a'.];W[mh];B[sg]LB[ig:a]C[B177 is a little soft-hearted, why not play at 'a'?

]
;W[sq];B[rr];W[jg];B[jh];W[ih]C[White is very happy with W180 and W182, the situation becomes relatively close.

Now White is a little thin.

];B[kh];W[ig];B[ii];W[kf];B[ki];W[kc];B[ob];W[bp]C[W190 is unreasonable, although White's situation is a little inferior, but White can't afford not to play in the middle.

Now the game is over, however originally White will lose by a little.]
