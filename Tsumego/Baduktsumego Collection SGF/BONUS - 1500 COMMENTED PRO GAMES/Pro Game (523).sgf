(;SZ[19]EV[China 8th NEC Cup quarter-final]DT[2002-11-16]PC[Qingdao, China]PB[Qiu Jun]BR[6p]PW[Liu Shizhen]WR[6p]RE[W+R]C[Commentary: Liu Shizhen 6p, Source: China Sports Weekly, Comment Translation: gogameworld.com.];B[qd];W[dc]C[Because I won the second place in the last year's NEC Cup, this time I get into quarter-finals directly as a seeded player. My first opponent is Qiu Jun 6p who has the nickname of "dawdling king". Before the game, some people warned me that I should be careful of his "dawdling power", however I do not take it to heart, because no matter how he can "dawdle", he must make his move within 30 seconds.];B[pq];W[dq];B[ce] 
;W[dh];B[ed]C[The knight's pressing at B7 is the favorite play of Qiu Jun 6p, as for this move he has some special study.];W[ec]LB[dd:a]C[So I did not push through and cut at 'a', instead I chose the simple variation of crawling at 8.];B[fd];W[gc];B[cc];W[gd]C[W12 leaning is another simple and clear way to settle the shape, locally this variation is usually considered as a slight loss for White, but in the case of a big komi, this variation is fully acceptable for White.];B[dd];W[gf];B[nc];W[cb] 
;B[bb];W[cn];B[iq];W[qo];B[pm];W[jp]C[The shoulder hit of W22 is rare, but this is not my invention. Long time ago, somebody played this move, specially in the situation when B21 is pressing hard on W20.];B[jq]LB[ip:a]C[I used this tactic two year ago in one game of the ranking competition between me and Qiu Jun, he crawled at 23 in that game, but I still feel Black should attach at 'a'.];W[lp];B[po];W[kq];B[ip] 
;W[jo];B[io];W[jn];B[fq];W[qp]C[White grabs the extension to 32 with sente, locally White can be very satisfied.];B[pp];W[qm];B[qn];W[rn];B[pn];W[ql];B[qq]LB[rm:a]C[B39 is slow-paced. Right now Black can only cut at 'a', in the game due to the turn of B39, it becomes tasteless no matter which side to cut in the future.] 
;W[qi]C[The two-space extension at W40 is perfect, White's opening is very successful.];B[hm];W[fp];B[gq];W[lc];B[jl];W[kl];B[kk];W[ll];B[lk];W[jk];B[jj];W[ik]

;W[db];B[dm]C[The knight's pressing move of B67 is unexpected, because this move does not have any impact on White.];W[ba]TR[ce]C[W68 is a huge move! White not only strengthens itself, but also it turns the marked black stone into a bad move, Black's situation has more deterioated.];B[km];W[ml];B[jm];W[mp];B[pl];W[nq];B[ro];W[cg] 
;B[eg];W[hl]LB[gh:a]C[The squeeze of W78 is unnecessary. W78 should directly jump to 'a', thus the situation is more easy for White to take control.];B[eh]C[The tenuki of B79 is alert!];W[dj];B[ei];W[dk];B[dn];W[cm];B[cl];W[dl];B[co]C[After B87 plays hane, for the first time in the game I feel nervous, at the current moment a small mistake can lead to a big disaster.] 
;W[bo];B[bp];W[do];B[cp];W[bn];B[dr];W[gh]LB[cq:a][bq:b][cr:c][br:d][er:e]C[Regardless of the safefy in the corner, W94 tries to kill Black's big dragon, it is a decision I has made in a rush. In fact, now if White just turns at 'a', then B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e' atari, the capturing race in the corner favors White.];B[bl] 
;W[ck];B[bd];W[ab];B[bf];W[bg];B[di];W[ci];B[dg];W[ae];B[af];W[ch];B[ff];W[cq] 
;B[bq];W[cr];B[br];W[fg]C[W112 is a strong move! White's shape is a little thin, but White has many uses in the upper right, Black has no way to live.];B[ge];W[he];B[fe];W[ad];B[gi];W[hi];B[gj];W[fj];B[df] 
;W[ee];B[hj];W[fi];B[fh];W[gg];B[ij];W[if];B[fk];W[ej];B[bk];W[bj];B[ao]LB[gl:a][rm:b]C[B133 should capture White's four stones at 'a', then atari at 'b', this way White's several stones on the left are still dangerous.]
