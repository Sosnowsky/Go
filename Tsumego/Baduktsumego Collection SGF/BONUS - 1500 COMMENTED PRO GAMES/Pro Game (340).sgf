;B[gb];W[hc];B[cc];W[nd];B[qf];W[jc]C[The sequence from the approach of W8 to the extension of W24 is Wang Lei's favorite play when taking White.];B[cq]C[The sequence after entering the corner with B25 is simple and clear.];W[cp];B[dq];W[ep];B[bp];W[bo]
;B[bq];W[co];B[fq];W[qn]C[Through W34, it becomes a steady game.];B[gq]LB[cj:a][hq:b][pr:c][pq:d][or:e][qr:f][mq:g][go:h][ql:i]C[B35: If Black forces at 'a' and grabs the big point on the left side, White definitely will counter-force at 'b', the value at the bottom appears bigger. But the play in the game seems slow, Black should consider to simply play at 'c', White perhaps will bump at 'd', next B 'e', W 'f', B 'g', next White will surely make the small knight's move at 'h',  even if Black still doubles up with B35, next B 'a' and B 'i' becomes miai, Black must get one, this is clearly better than the real game.]
;W[ci]C[In the real game, White gets to first take the big point with W36.];B[pr];W[pq];B[or];W[qr];B[mq];W[qh]LB[go:a]C[Through W42, White again takes another big point, White saves the small knight's move at 'a', White's speed is relatively fast.];B[pi]C[The shoulder-hit of B43 is a common play in this situation.];W[ph];B[oi];W[oh]
;B[ni];W[re];B[qe];W[rf];B[rd];W[mg];B[li]C[Through B53, White obtains sente.];W[go]C[After making a detour, White again grabs the good point with W54, White takes advantage.];B[rr]LB[qs:a][rn:b]C[After the clamp of B55, if White descends at 'a', Black will attach at 'b', White is hard to answer.];W[qq]C[The connection of W56 is simple.]
;B[qs];W[qk]LB[rg:a]C[Because for White to retreat at 'a' is almost sente, being able to make a good extension with W58, White should be happy.];B[pm];W[qm];B[pk]LB[ok:a]C[Black has no other choice but to play B59 and B61, otherwise if White attacks at 'a', Black's shape will be restricted.];W[io]C[W62 is a carefree and good move, so far White is successful in the opening.];B[qj]C[The tiger's move of B63 prevents White from extending here.];W[pl];B[ol]
;W[ql]C[The wedge and connection of W64 and W66 are inevitable.];B[rj]LB[hp:a][ho:b][kp:c]C[B67: Black should take tenuki on the right side, and play at 'a', next W 'b' and B 'c', this way, Black can keep balance with White in territory.];W[qg]LB[nh:a][ng:b][rh:c]C[W68 is a must, otherwise if Black pushes at 'a', next W 'b' and Black can attach over at 'c'.];B[nb];W[mb];B[ob]C[The hane and connection of B69 and B71 is very big, otherwise if White plays hane at 71, Black can't tolerate.]
;W[kh];B[jj];W[ok];B[nk];W[pj];B[oj];W[pk];B[qi];W[nl]C[White gains a big profit with the atari of W74 and W80.];B[ml];W[nm];B[lk];W[ln]
;B[kp];W[ko]C[The diagonal of W86 is a calm move.

After this move, it is time for lunch break.];B[hj]LB[jp:a][hq:b][jq:c]C[B87: Black has no other choice but to stick the head out to the center, if Black extends at 'a', White can attach down at 'b'; Moreover if White crosses over with the diagonal at 'c', White can cap at 87.];W[iq];B[rq];W[rp];B[kq];W[fj];B[gl]
;W[ii]LB[ij:a][gk:b][hl:c][fl:d]C[When W94, if Black connects at 'a', next W 'b', B 'c' and W 'd', White is favorable.];B[hi];W[ih];B[fk];W[ej];B[el];W[dn];B[fe];W[ge]
;B[gf];W[he];B[lb];W[mc];B[ma];W[lc];B[bh]C[Black desperately grabs endgame with the large knight's move of B109.];W[ch];B[bi];W[bg]LB[cg:a][dg:b][bj:c]C[When White plays hane with W112, if Black cuts at 'a', White can atari at 'b' in sente then hane at 'c' in sente, Black is not good.]
;B[cj]C[Therefore, in the game the counter-hane of B113 is a game-deciding move.];W[cf]C[W114 is the only move.];B[dk];W[be];B[bd];W[de];B[dd];W[cd];B[of];W[pf];B[ce];W[eh]C[With the sequence from B115 to W124, they destroy each other's territory, it is not necessarily to Black's advantage.]
;B[bk];W[dm]C[W126 is a calm move, White plays thickness and wants to proceed safely.];B[bl];W[bm];B[pe];W[oe];B[hh]C[B131: Black tries to obtain sente.];W[cd];B[bc];W[gk]C[The counterattack of W134 is severe.];B[dl];W[hk]
;B[ij];W[hl];B[gm];W[hm];B[aj];W[ah];B[ck];W[cm];B[al]C[Through B145, Black makes two eyes, the game for Black is as good as lost.];W[ig];B[kb];W[jb];B[mo]
