;W[rc];B[qe];W[nc];B[cn]LB[fq:a]C[B21 can also be considered to approach the corner at 'a'.];W[fq];B[bp];W[qo];B[cq];W[iq];B[qm]C[The tight pincer of B27 is a positive play.];W[oo] 
;B[np]LB[mq:a]C[B29 is better than the two-space extension at 'a'.];W[qk]C[The play of W30 is very strong and tough.];B[pl];W[qi];B[ph];W[pi];B[nl]C[After B35 jumps out, it seems Black is more active.];W[nn]LB[no:a]C[The reason why W36 is not played as the press move at 'a' is, that White does not want to help Black to build territory, but the play in the game is not smooth either.];B[oi]C[The attack following B37 is very happy.] 
;W[oj];B[nj];W[ok];B[nk];W[oh];B[ni];W[rh];B[og];W[rj];B[nm];W[mn];B[kq]C[Black seizes the extension to 49 and can be satisfied.];W[lq]C[The play of W50 seems not favorable to White.] 
;B[lp];W[op];B[oq];W[mq];B[mp];W[kr];B[nq]C[Through 57, White at the top becomes weaker.];W[qp]C[The sequence after W58 tries to seek safety.];B[qq];W[pm];B[ql]LB[pn:a][rm:b]C[If B61 is played at 'a', then White can clamp at 'b' to cross over.] 
;W[rl];B[qn];W[ro];B[on];W[om]C[The purpose of W66 is to obtain sente.];B[pn];W[no]LB[ol:a][rn:b][ln:c][mm:d][lm:e][ml:f][ll:g][mk:h][lj:i]C[If W68 is played at 'a', then B 68, W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 'e', W 'f', B 'g', W 'h' and B 'i', Black seals White in with sente, it is not good for White.] 
;B[ol];W[rq]C[Through 70, White has seeked safety, but meanwhile Black becomes very thick and has a potential to surround territory in the center.];B[lr];W[jq]LB[mr:a][jr:b]C[W72 has no other choice, if it is played as the atari at 'a', then Black will play at 'b', White is no good.];B[mr];W[hd];B[hc];W[fd]C[W74 and W76 are good moves.];B[ec];W[cm] 
;B[dm];W[cl];B[bn]LB[dl:a]C[B81 is worth study, from the whole board point of view, pressing at 'a' is the vital point.];W[dl]C[After 82, White gains territory in the upper left, however, Black's outside influence on the right may comes to nothing.];B[jr];W[ir];B[pk];W[pj];B[ed];W[ee];B[gd]LB[fe:a]C[B89 should atari at 'a'.] 
;W[fe];B[ge];W[fg];B[hg]C[Through 93, Black can not be satisfied.];W[nd]C[W94 is a mutual good point.];B[rg];W[qg];B[pg];W[rf];B[pf];W[sg];B[er]

;B[al];W[bj];B[lc];W[hi]C[W118 achieves two purposes, it not only cutivates its own territory and also consequently Black's outside influence on the right may become useless.];B[en];W[fm];B[rn];W[sn];B[fn];W[js];B[rr];W[sr];B[rs] 
;W[rm];B[cb];W[mb];B[cd]C[B131 is a common tesuji.];W[ce];B[bd];W[bc];B[dc];W[be];B[ad]C[Through 137, a ko fight results, White has nothing to be afraid of.];W[lb];B[kb] 
;W[me];B[de]LB[ke:a]C[B141 reinforcing with the knight's move at 'a' is the proper move.];W[jd]C[W142 delivers the fatal blow to Black.];B[kc];W[gf];B[hf];W[he];B[gc];W[jf]C[Through 148, Black's two stones have been isolated, White wins the game for sure.];B[lf];W[mg]
