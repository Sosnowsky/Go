Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[qo]C[B5 protecting the corner is "Kobayashi Style", in my memory O Rissei also likes to use this opening. In the first two games, Lee Changho suffers loss in fast-paced games. In this game, he obviously wants to play steadily and fights a prolonged war.]
;W[jq];B[fc];W[df];B[db];W[cc];B[ic];W[di]LB[qg:a]C[W12: For White to approach the corner at 'a' is relatively common.];B[pj]C[Since White didn't approach the corner, W13 taking the big point is inevitable.

];W[nq];B[cq]LB[cn:a]C[B15: Black strikes at 3-3 and it is a territory-oriented play, for Black to approach the corner at 'a' is also possible.]
;W[cp];B[dq];W[eq];B[er];W[bq]LB[fr:a][bp:b][bo:c][co:d]C[The hane of W20 is a local good move, if White plays double-hane at 'a', next B 'b', W 'c' and B 'd', White is not good.];B[br];W[dr];B[cr];W[fr]
;B[ep];W[fq];B[bp];W[bo];B[aq];W[cn]C[Through W30, White gets to play on both sides, it is very efficient.

];B[lq]LB[no:a]C[The invasion of B31 is inexplicable! Here clearly is not a place to play, to cap at 'a' is general thinking.];W[no];B[lo];W[nm];B[lm]
;W[lr];B[mr]LB[mk:a]C[As to the attachment of W36, the sequence from B37 to W48 is not to Black's advantage and should be reserved, Black should simply make the knight's move at 'a'.];W[mq];B[kr];W[lp];B[kq];W[kp];B[jp];W[jr];B[ls];W[ko];B[nr]
;W[ip];B[mk];W[nc]C[Through W50, White is already favorable for the game.

];B[ob];W[kc];B[je]LB[nb:a][oc:b]C[B51 and B53 are positive plays in an unfavorable situation. Next if White blocks at 'a', Black will attach at 'b', Black's corner already becomes territory and Black can be satisfied.];W[qf]C[W54 is a very nimble move!];B[pf];W[pg];B[of]
;W[qd];B[qc];W[qe];B[pc];W[qh];B[le];W[me];B[ld];W[gc];B[gb];W[hb];B[hc];W[gd]
;B[fb];W[ng];B[md];W[qm]C[Although White's two stones W50 and W52 are being captured, but following W64 and W66, White takes a big advantage, the jump of W72 is again sente, White also gets to force with W74 and White is successful.
];B[qi];W[pi];B[oi];W[ph];B[nh]LB[oj:a]C[B79: Black has no choice but to play diagonal of B79, if Black reinforces the cut at 'a', White will double at 79 and Black's big group is too heavy.];W[oj];B[og]
;W[ok]C[White captures two stones B13 and B75, White is clearly leading in territory. So far, Lee Sedol plays very smoothly.
];B[bm]C[The strike of B83 is game-deciding move! No matter what the result is, only if Black messes up the situation, Black may have a chance to turn the game around.

];W[cm]LB[ao:a][es:b]C[W84: White can also consider to descend at 'a', later on White will be very happy to take one stone in sente at 'b'.];B[cl];W[dl];B[ck];W[ci];B[dm];W[eo];B[ao]C[After Black plays hane of B91, it forms a ko, this is the key for the game.]
;W[qq];B[oq];W[ib]C[The exchange of W92 and B93 is damaging, White should directly crawl with W94 to create ko threats.];B[jb];W[an]C[W96: White is not soft-hearted and elects to fight the ko, both sides have no way to retreat.
];B[fp]LB[bn:a]C[B97: It is too heavy for Black to fight the ko directly at 'a'. In the real game, it leaves more aji.];W[ap];B[gp];W[es];B[ao];W[jc]
;B[ha];W[ap];B[ql];W[pm];B[ao];W[id];B[ia];W[ap];B[rm];W[bq];B[qj];W[rh];B[rn]
;W[em]C[Through W116, it forms an exchange, Black takes a little advantage, but the whole situation is still to White's advantage.];B[bp];W[ao];B[fl];W[el];B[rd];W[re];B[rc];W[pl];B[qk];W[rg];B[mp];W[jo]LB[mo:a]C[W128: If White plays atari at 'a', Black may extend out at 128.]
;B[mo];W[mj];B[lj];W[ll];B[kl];W[mi];B[hr]LB[hq:a]C[B135 is a good move, next if White makes the diagonal at 'a', Black's corner becomes ko-alive.];W[gq];B[fn]C[The jump of B137 becomes sente.
];W[hq];B[bi]
;W[bh];B[ej];W[fm];B[li];W[mh];B[oh];W[mm];B[lk];W[ln];B[nj];W[dj]LB[gi:a]C[W150 is the only losing move and it is also a fatal one! White should play at around 'a', this way White is not that easy to lose this game.
];B[cg]LB[am:a][bj:b]C[The play of B151 is excellent timing! Since B 'a' is sente, then White can make life by retreating at 'b', White has no choice but to reinforce.
]
;W[bj];B[ee]C[After Black flies out with B153, White is very painful.];W[ef]LB[de:a]C[However with W154 for White to connect at 'a' calmly is relatively better than the real game.];B[ff];W[de];B[gg]C[Through B157, the situation has been turned around.];W[ed];B[fd];W[hh];B[gh];W[hj]
;B[gi];W[nk];B[ni];W[hi];B[km]LB[np:a][gl:b]C[B167: If Black captures at 'a', Black will extend at 'b', White's three stones in the center are dangerous.
];W[ml];B[gl];W[pe];B[oe];W[fe];B[ge]
;W[il];B[jh]LB[np:a]C[Later on, B 'a' taking is sente and Black gains a big profit, Black calls off his troops on time with B175, it is a declaration of victory.

However at the end Black wins by 7+ points, Lee Changho's endgame skill is really brilliant!];W[ji];B[kh];W[hf];B[gf];W[hg];B[ie];W[gm];B[np];W[mn];B[eh]
