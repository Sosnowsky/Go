At the age of 56, Kato takes a 2:1 lead in the best-of-seven series, making this final even interesting to watch.];W[dp];B[cd]C[Kato specially likes to play the small-point.];W[qp];B[op];W[lp]
;B[pm];W[oo];B[no];W[on];B[pp];W[qn];B[qq];W[qo];B[nn];W[om];B[pr];W[qi]C[The sequence from W6 to W18 is the standard "demon sword" joseki.];B[ec]LB[oc:a][qg:b][qk:c]C[B19: Black doesn't protect the corner at 'a', because Black has planned that when White approaches the corner at 'a', Black can make the two-space extension at 'b' and aim to invade at 'c' as well.]
;W[oc];B[qg];W[kc];B[cj];W[cn]LB[fq:a][ln:b][qk:c]TR[qg]SQ[lp]C[W24 is the wrong direction for protecting the corner, White should make the small knight's move at 'a'. Due to the addition of the marked black stone, the jump of B 'b' is almost sente, otherwise White can't tolerate if Black invades at 'c'. Therefore, to support the marked white stone is an inevitable consideration in this situation, however in the game the position of W24 is too far.];B[ip];W[gq]LB[ln:a][fq:b]C[W26: If White jumps to 'a', for Black to approach the corner at 'b' would be an excellent point, White can't be satisfied.]
;B[ln];W[rf]LB[oi:a][hq:b][gp:c][in:d]TR[lp]C[W28: For White to jump and strengthen at 'a' is the common play, followed by B 'b', W 'c' and B 'd', the marked white stone would be completely captured, White can't be satisfied.];B[qf]LB[rg:a][pf:b][pg:c]C[B29 is the proper move, if Black blocks at 'a', then W29, B 'b' and W 'c', White can reinforce with sente by sacrificing, this exactly fits White's plan.];W[rg];B[od]
;W[nd];B[nc]LB[re:a][qh:b][qk:c]C[The three moves B31, B33 and B35 reflect Mr. Kato's strength and power. Now if Black blocks at 'a', then W 'b', Black is no good. White doesn't have a stone at 'b', and still need to worry about the invasion at 'c', this is also the purpose of B31 and B33.];W[pb]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.];B[nb]C[The stand of B35 is very strong and unyielding.];W[pd]C[The sequence after W36 is inevitable.];B[oe];W[pe];B[qe]
;W[pf];B[qc];W[pc];B[qh];W[rh];B[pi];W[qj];B[of]LB[og:a][me:b]TR[nd]C[The attachment of B47 is the follow-up maneuver, forcing W 'a' and B 'b', the marked white stone basically couldn't move. ];W[og];B[me]
;W[pg];B[ph];W[nh]LB[ng:a][mf:b]C[W52 is a calm move, if White extends at 'a', then Black would double up at 'b', White still can't capture Black's stones.];B[pj];W[pk];B[ok];W[nj];B[qk];W[pl];B[oj];W[ql]
;B[nm];W[ke];B[ld];W[kd];B[mg];W[lh]C[In the game, White finally gets out of trouble by sealing off Black with W62 and W66.];B[ng];W[oh];B[lg]C[So far, the game is closed for the first day. Black has used 2 hour and 56 minutes, White has consumed 4 hours and 8 minutes.];W[kg];B[lb];W[kh]
;B[kb];W[jp]C[The pull-out of W74 is inevitable.];B[ol];W[rq];B[rr];W[sp];B[jq];W[jo];B[kq];W[lo];B[lj];W[mh];B[er]C[B85 is a good move for mock attack.]
;W[iq]LB[eq:a]C[The cut of W86 should be reserved, to make the diagonal's extension at 'a' would be better.];B[lq];W[mp];B[nr];W[ml]C[W90 is unnecessary.];B[kl]C[The knight's move of B91 is a good move, White has incurred some losses.];W[mj];B[nl];W[ho]LB[dq:a]C[W94 is again a slow move, protecting the corner at 'a' is better. Even if the five white stones get killed, the corner is bigger.]
;B[cq];W[cp]LB[dq:a][dr:b][bq:c][ch:d]C[W96 is the losing move! At any rate, White should first push at 'a', then B 'b', W 96, B 'c' and W 'd', this way the game would be still far from over.];B[dq];W[bq];B[br];W[bp];B[fq];W[fp];B[gr]
;W[hq];B[dh]C[After Black lives with sente and comes back to reinforce at 105, Black's advantage is clear.
After this move, it is time for noon break.];W[bd]C[W106: White makes the last-ditch effort.];B[bc];W[ce];B[dd];W[cg];B[dg]C[The attachment of B111 is very simple and clear.];W[bi];B[ch];W[ar];B[cr]
;W[bh];B[cf];W[bg];B[bf];W[bj];B[ck];W[bk];B[cl];W[bl];B[ic]C[White has to crawl in the second line, Black grabs the knight's move at 125, White already has no chance of winning.];W[he];B[in];W[il]
