So far in the Myungin league games, Mok Jinseok 6p and Cho Hunhyun 9p have three consecutive wins, both Lee Sedol 7p and An Joyoung 7p have 2 wins and 1 loss, Song TaeKon 4p has only 1 win but 2 losses.];W[dp];B[qp];W[dd];B[nq]

(;W[nd]LB[qg:a][pc:b][qc:c][rh:d][oc:e][oe:f][nf:g][jc:h][qe:i][pf:j][nc:k][ne:l]C[W14 is a fresh and novel play. White normally would hit at 'a' or attach under at 'b'. If White hits at 'a', then Black will make the diagonal's extension at 'c', White can bridge over at 'd', the situation is even (see var a). If White attaches under at 'b', then B 'e', W 'c', B 'f', W 'g' and B 'h' (see var b), however in this variation, Black is left with the tactic of creating a ko by playing the diagonal at 'i' and the wedge at 'j', White always has some apprehensions. Moreover if then White plays at 14, Black definitely would not simply connect at 'k', instead Black will counterattack with a push at 'l'.];B[nc]
;W[pc]LB[oc:a][qc:b][jc:c]C[In the game, White first plays at 14 then attaches under at 16, White wants the sequence of B 'a', W 'b' and B 'c', this means that when White plays at 14, Black answers at 15.];B[qc];W[oc];B[od]C[In the game, Song TaeKon doesn't want to be exploited by White, so he counterattacks with 17 and 19.];W[qb];B[qd];W[rc];B[ne];W[md]

(;B[nb]LB[jc:a][jb:b][ob:c][oa:d][pb:e][ib:f][lb:g][ja:h][ma:i][rb:j][re:k]C[B31: It seems Black should directly hane at 'a', reserving the variation at the top. However if so, then White would cut at 'b', Black descends at 31, White instead would reduce liberties at 'c', followed by B 'd', W 'e', B 'f', W 'g', B 'h' and W 'i', a clever diagonal, Black would collapse (see var a). After Black exchanges B31 for W 'e', Black has lost the powerful maneuver of B 'j', W 'e' and B 'k', but in order to play at 'a', Black has to play this way.];W[pb];B[jc]
;W[nf];B[me];W[jd];B[ic];W[id];B[mf]LB[hc:a][lf:b]C[B39: Black must turn like this. If Black answers at 'a', then White can play at 'b' to kill Black.];W[hc];B[hb];W[gb];B[ib];W[qg]LB[gc:a][rh:b][dj:c][nh:d][ni:e][mg:f]C[W44 is over-cautious. In fact White should first reinforce at 'a', after B 'b', then White can grab the central point at 'c'. This way White's moyo would be extremely huge, also White is also left with the tactic of cutting Black's tail by W 'd', B 'e' and W 'f'.]

;W[qi];B[ph];W[rj];B[ii];W[kj];B[jl];W[pf]LB[re:a]C[The connection of W64 is a steady play. This move prevents Black from reducing liberties with the hane at 'a' and guards against Black's wedge at 64 to capture two white stones, and it also makes Black outside thin.];B[kf];W[if]LB[jg:a]C[The counterattack of W66 is inevitable. If White simply connects back at 'a', then after the attachment of B66, White couldn't make any good shape.];B[jg]
;W[hf];B[kg];W[ge];B[fq];W[ij]C[W72: White attaches out from the root, it is a fierce and ruthless play. Lee Sedol's play is always active and never allows his opponent any chance to take a breather.];B[gf];W[gd];B[hj];W[ik];B[gl];W[il];B[cn];W[eo]
;B[go];W[gk]LB[dm:a]C[W82 is more relentless. White normally would make the knight's move at 'a', but Lee Sedol still wants to separate Black.];B[hk];W[hl];B[gj];W[fk];B[fl];W[ek];B[el];W[dk];B[dl];W[ck]

Black should jump to 'b'. If White still plays as in the game, W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f', W 'g', B 'h', W 'i', B 'j', W 'k', B 'l' and W 'm', Black can attack White severely at 'n' or 'o'; Furthermore when B 'b', if White doesn't want to give up stones by playing the hane at 'p', then Black can hang at 'q' to fight with White directly.]
