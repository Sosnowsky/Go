Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[pd]C[Is Cho Hunhyun really old? In the first round of Samsung Cup, he luckily turned the game around by beating Wang Yihui with so much an effort, in this game he didn't play well either.];W[dd];B[qp];W[dq];B[do]
;W[op]C[As to B5, W6 is Gu Li's favorite move.];B[cq];W[qq];B[cf];W[ch];B[ck]LB[cm:a]C[B11 aims to prevent White from approaching at 'a'.];W[df];B[dr];W[eq];B[er];W[cp]
;B[fq]LB[dp:a]C[Black has no assurance of success with the counterattack of B17! The original move of B17 is to cut at 'a', the game would be still earlier. Recently, Cho Hunhyun's play becomes very weak and is easy to collapse.];W[bq]C[With the sequence following W18, White easily makes life inside Black's territory, Black clearly incurs a big loss!];B[cr];W[dp];B[co];W[bo];B[ep];W[bp];B[cm];W[cn];B[dn]
;W[fp];B[eo];W[bn]C[The variation up to W30 is not difficult at all, Black couldn't kill White.];B[gp];W[bm];B[fo];W[cl];B[dl];W[dm];B[em];W[dk]C[White cuts with W38, White's one stone instead gets captured.];B[cm]
;W[bl];B[ci]LB[ek:a][mq:b]C[B41 could be a desperate play under an unfavorable situation, but here White has much more stones, it is not a place for Black to exert power, Black should sacrifice by playing at 'a' then grab the huge point at 'b', this way it would be slow and Black can wait for chances.];W[cg];B[bk];W[dj];B[di];W[ei]C[W42, W44 and W46 are all strongest plays, Black sinks into a difficult situation. You should know this is what Gu Li is good at, he can't miss it.];B[eh]LB[dh:a][cj:b]C[If B47 at 'a', then White will push at 'b', Black's two stones can't be saved.]
;W[el];B[fi];W[dm]C[White takes two stones and connects all together, Black didn't gain anything but added one lonely group, White takes a big lead. In this situation, if it were Lee Changho, he can simply play the game and wins easily, there will be no so many big fights, but Gu Li prefers to "resolve" his opponents through fights.];B[cc];W[ce];B[ec];W[ej];B[dh];W[fd];B[gg];W[fc];B[fb];W[dc]
;B[db];W[ed];B[eb];W[hc]LB[lq:a][kq:b]C[W64 overly stresses on attack, the value of B 'a' is huge! For White to play at 'b' means White can win the game without any fight. It seems the play style is really different.];B[lq];W[pn];B[ro];W[rq];B[qm];W[nq];B[qf]
;W[pk]C[W72 is a good point to put pressure on Black and White also aims at Black's big dragon on the left side.];B[pm];W[om];B[ol];W[pl];B[ok];W[pj];B[oj];W[qn];B[rm];W[nm];B[pi];W[qi]
;B[rk];W[oi]C[White's sacrifice with W86 appears very bold in a favorable situation.];B[ph]C[B87: Black also first tries to capture.];W[nj];B[ni];W[oh];B[nk];W[pg];B[qh];W[qg];B[rh];W[mj]
;B[mk];W[lk];B[ml];W[rg];B[og];W[nh];B[ri];W[lj];B[mm];W[pf];B[ng];W[mh];B[mg]
;W[lh];B[ne];W[kf];B[hj];W[qc];B[qd];W[od];B[oe];W[pc];B[rc];W[hh]C[W120 is severe! Because White's center is very thick, Black's big dragon is very dangerous.];B[dg];W[be]
;B[ef]C[Black makes eyes with B121 and B123 but damages the corner eye space.];W[bc]C[The intervolving fight following W124 is obvious, Black can't look after both groups.];B[bb];W[cd];B[cb];W[ab];B[hb];W[gb];B[ga];W[gc];B[ib];W[jc]
;B[jb];W[nd];B[pe];W[gj];B[gi];W[hi];B[ij];W[hg];B[hf];W[if];B[gf];W[ie];B[ic]
;W[id];B[lc];W[gh]C[After the push of W150, Black's big dragon get killed, the game is over.];B[mb];W[rb];B[rd];W[nb];B[ob];W[mn];B[ln];W[lo];B[nn];W[mo]
;B[on];W[kn];B[jp];W[io];B[hm];W[oc];B[na];W[md];B[ld];W[mc];B[nc];W[ip];B[iq]
;W[nb];B[de];W[bf];B[nc];W[hq];B[ir];W[nb];B[bi];W[bg];B[nc];W[hn];B[jo];W[jn]
;B[im];W[nb]C[Gu Li advances to the fight eight, which will take place on 10/6-10/7.])
