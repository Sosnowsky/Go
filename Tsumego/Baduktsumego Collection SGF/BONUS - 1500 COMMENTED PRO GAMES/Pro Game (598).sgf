Translation:GoGameWorld.];B[qd]C[In the game 3 of the Mingren challenger final, Qiu Jun played brilliantly and won the game over Yu Bin 9p by resignation, getting the right to challenge the current Mingren Zhou Heyang.];W[dc];B[pp];W[dp];B[cn]C[Black approaches the corner with B5 inside White's moyo, it is a challenging attitude.]
;W[cl]C[The sequence following the pincer of W6 is a tic-for-tat play.];B[fq];W[dn];B[cq];W[dq];B[cp];W[do];B[bn];W[dr];B[cr];W[hq];B[dm];W[cm]
;B[em];W[dk]C[Through W20, the result is not to Black's advantage.];B[de]LB[cf:a][cg:b]C[B21: For Black to make the large knight's approach at 'a' is usual, in the game White's pincer at 'b' is just right, Black seems unreasonable.];W[cg];B[cc];W[cb];B[cd];W[eb];B[ef];W[gd]LB[fk:a][fc:b][gc:c]C[W28 is a state of mind, White should jump to 'a' instead, it is a perfect point, if Black presses at 'b', White can handle lightly by playing at 'c'.]
;B[ci]C[After invasion of B29, the game gets into a fierce fight.];W[di];B[ch];W[dg];B[dh];W[eg];B[ei];W[ek];B[fj];W[eh];B[dj];W[fk];B[gg]
;W[gh];B[gj];W[gk]LB[hg:a]C[When Black extends with B43, with W44 White originally should play the simple hane at 'a'.];B[hj]LB[hh:a][hg:b][ff:c][fn:d][fg:e]C[B45: But Black doesn't play the hane at 'a', after White's hane at 'b', Black sinks into a difficult situation, no matter what Black can only play at 'a', then W 'c' and B 'd', later on Black can seek the chance to cut at 'e', reducing liberties by sacrifice.];W[hg];B[fd];W[gc]LB[gf:a]C[But W48 is slow in a favorable consciousness! If playing at 'a', White would have a big advantage.]
;B[hf];W[gf];B[ge];W[fg];B[he];W[fc];B[fn]C[Because White gives in, after the counter-pincer of B55, the situation is still very chaotic.

;B[jr];W[kr];B[lk];W[ll];B[kq]LB[km:a][kl:b][ko:c][kn:d][mn:e]C[B91 is a mistake! Black should first peep at 'a', after W 'b', then Black plays B91, this way when White pushes at 'c', after Black ataris at 'd', Black could hang at 'e'. In the game, White is left with the extension at 'e'.];W[kp];B[lq];W[ko]
;B[kn];W[ir];B[im];W[ln];B[km];W[kl];B[lm];W[ok]C[After W102, Black already is very hard to continue attacking White.];B[pi];W[qk];B[pm];W[hm]LB[jj:a]C[W106 is a mistake, which gives Black the sente connection at 'a', this has a big impact on the fight later on.]

;B[op];W[mp]TR[kq]C[From the sequence from W110 to W134, the mistake of B91 (the marked black stone) can be easily seen.];B[kc]C[B135: Black grabs the big point, although the game is to White's advantage, but the outcome of the game is still hard to guess.];W[mg]TR[hm]C[But due to the mistake of W106, the strength of White's extension of W136 is greatly abated.];B[bg];W[bf];B[kf];W[kg];B[lf];W[je]

Black should first make the sente diagonal's extension at 'a', then push and atari at 'b', which is a huge move! Next the outcome of the game hangs in how White can obtain sente in the upper right corner then grab the point 'c'.];W[ad];B[ag]
