;W[ce];B[cf];W[cd];B[nq];W[qn];B[iq];W[df];B[cg];W[ef];B[cj]C[The opening up to B15 is common.];W[ep];B[dq];W[do]
;B[co];W[dm];B[cn];W[ek];B[dn];W[en];B[fo];W[eo];B[ej];W[fk];B[oc]C[B29 is very big. It seems Black wants to defend at bottom, but B29 protecting the corner is the biggest move on the board.];W[lq]C[The invasion of W30 is resolute and of great momentum.]
;B[fr];W[pr]C[So far, the game is steady.];B[qi];W[jd];B[lc];W[ei]C[W36 is good and thick move, White seals off Black.];B[di];W[fj];B[eh];W[dj];B[fi]C[B41: Now there are no ko threats, so White should play hane to the center.];W[gi]
;B[ej];W[dk];B[fh];W[qk]C[B46: White becomes thick in the lower right corner and White's shape looks good. So far, White's opening is not bad.];B[hd]C[B47 is the vital point for the shape.];W[qg]C[W48: White is not willing to fall behind and invades strongly.];B[ph];W[qe];B[pe];W[rd]C[B52 is the dodging tactic at this situation.];B[pd]
;W[rf];B[rc];W[sc];B[sb];W[sd];B[qb];W[pf]C[W60: White simply dodges himself.];B[nh];W[pg];B[rh];W[rg];B[pn]C[The attachment of B65 is very clever.]
;W[pm];B[on];W[qo]C[W68: Black doesn't seem to have gained anything.];B[nl]C[The knight's move of B69 is good feeling.];W[mp];B[pl];W[om];B[nm];W[ol];B[ok];W[qm];B[kp]
;W[kq];B[np]C[B79: Black sticks out and aims to initiate a fight.];W[jp]C[W80 is very thick move, White judges his situation is not bad.];B[mo];W[lo];B[mn];W[ho];B[pk];W[qj];B[pj];W[gq];B[gr]
;W[km]C[W90: White's shape is very beautiful.];B[fc];W[gh];B[gg];W[hg];B[gf];W[fd];B[fe];W[gd];B[ed];W[gc];B[ec];W[ee]C[W102: Nobody wants to retreat.]

;W[ib];B[ff]C[B117: Although three white stones are captured, but White can cross over in first line and White also simplifies the situation. Thus, White is not bad.];W[ld];B[kc];W[md]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.

White is a little favorable for the game.];B[mc];W[mj]C[W122: Lee Sedol hits Black's vital point. Black is difficult to answer.];B[mk];W[nj];B[lj];W[oi];B[oh]
;W[mi];B[nk];W[li];B[kj]C[B131: It seems Black starts to fight desperately.];W[ki]C[W132: The situation is very complicated. However Black has many cut points.];B[ji];W[jh]C[W134 is urgent point. Black is still very difficult.];B[oj]C[B135: Black has no choice but to connect back. White will cut now.];W[lk]C[W136: White cuts from the root, should White be this relentless?];B[jj];W[kk]C[W138: Black doesn't seem to have good variations and can only fight this way.]
;B[ih];W[jg];B[ig];W[ii];B[ij];W[hi];B[jf];W[lg];B[lm]C[B147: Black elects to give up five stones in the center.];W[jk];B[kn];W[jm];B[ko]C[B151: Black redeems a lot, but Black is still very difficult to win.]
;W[nr]C[W152: White gains a lot of territory.];B[lf]C[B153 is very sharp. If responding incorrectly, the situation will be turned around.];W[ha];B[dg];W[fa];B[eg];W[ga]C[W158: White crosses over safely.];B[mr];W[or];B[in];W[hq];B[hm]
;W[ik];B[hr];W[ir]C[W166: Now Black is leading on the board.];B[jr];W[jq];B[is];W[ip]C[W170: Black is already very difficult to continue.];B[io];W[lp];B[ln];W[ni];B[oo]
;W[pi];B[mg];W[kf]C[The sequence up to W178 is inevitable.];B[ke];W[kg]C[Overall, Black's attack following the invasion of W48 is not positive enough. Instead, White sacrifices three stones simply in the upper-left corner and achieves safety. Next W122 hits the vital point and Black doesn't have any chance after that.

The decisive game 3 will take place on 1/9.])
