;W[qo];B[oc];W[pd];B[pc];W[qe];B[qc];W[nd];B[mc]C[The opening starts with Black's territory battling White's influence.];W[pj];B[re];W[np];B[oq]LB[po:a]C[B17: To attach out at 'a' is common, but now White is clearly favorable in the number and strength of stones, in the game, to avoid a direct confrontation is a clever choice.]
;W[oo];B[mq];W[qf];B[rf];W[qg];B[de];W[cj]LB[dh:a]C[W24 is rarely seen and seems careless, it is better to make a two-space high pincer at 'a'.];B[cc];W[cg];B[dd];W[ec];B[bd]
;W[cm]C[The two two-space extensions of W26 and W30 is too insipid.];B[dk];W[ck];B[hc]LB[eq:a]C[B33: For Black to protect the corner at 'a' is bigger.];W[le];B[ge];W[eq];B[cn];W[dm];B[ep];W[fp]
;B[eo];W[dq];B[cq];W[kp]C[The configuration from W36 to W44 is not bad.];B[fo];W[gp];B[go];W[hp];B[rp];W[ro];B[rg];W[qh];B[ki]
;W[ie];B[he]LB[kk:a]C[The hit of B55 is too slow! Can't see White has any tactic here if Black tenukis, Black certainly should jump to 'a'! Black is already way ahead in territory, to destroy White's potential in the center is the most urgent.];W[ii]LB[kk:a]C[The cap of W56 is a rather dangerous move, White most likely will drive Black into his own territory, White should cap at 'a', enclosing territory and attacking Black as well.];B[kf]C[B57: It is good enough for Black to jump to 'a'.]LB[kk:a];W[kh];B[il]C[The play of B57 and B59 is unnecessary.];W[ji];B[kl]
;W[hm];B[hl];W[gm];B[gl];W[fm];B[im]LB[kj:a][lh:b][hj:c]C[B65 and B67 are questionable, Black should extend at 'a', then W 'b' and B 'c', White's shape is light and nimble, Black's left corner would not get ruined by White that terribly.];W[kj];B[jo];W[ho];B[jp]
;W[in];B[jn];W[kq];B[mp];W[lo];B[mo];W[ln];B[lm];W[mn];B[mm]LB[ml:a]C[The sequence of B69 to B81 is far below the standard! Black has completely helped White to become thick, it is better to play nothing and jump to 'a' directly.];W[nn];B[gi]
;W[cr]C[From W84, White uses his thickness and favorable ko threats to expropriate Black's corner, Black can only make life grievously like in the game, and the right corner can also be used as ko threat, Black is too painful!];B[br];W[bs];B[dr];W[ds];B[cs];W[qq];B[qp];W[cr];B[bm];W[bl];B[cs];W[cb]

;B[dn];W[mk]C[Through 124, White's advantage is already obvious.];B[lk];W[mj];B[if];W[lc];B[mb];W[lf];B[nl];W[ol];B[nk];W[ic];B[id]
;W[jc];B[hb];W[je];B[nj];W[ni];B[qn]C[The cut of B141 is a game-deciding move.];W[rn];B[qm];W[rm];B[oi];W[pr];B[or];W[qs]
;B[nq];W[on];B[ns];W[pr];B[mr];W[nh];B[ql];W[rl];B[qk];W[qj]LB[rh:a][sj:b]C[The block of B158 is a mistake, White should block at 'a', Black couldn't connect.];B[rk]
;W[sl];B[sj]C[After Black connects back with the diagonal's extension, the difference between two sides has been narrowed down a lot.];W[iq];B[md];W[gh]LB[me:a]C[The attachment of W164 is questionable and almost the losing move! Because of White's earlier mistake, White is a little anxious and wants to kill Black's big group, in fact if White blocks at 'a', White would be still slightly favorable for the game. In the game, Black lives with 8 points, the game has been turned around.];B[lj];W[li];B[ml];W[mi];B[fi];W[ej]

;W[ek];B[hi];W[hh];B[ij];W[hf];B[gf];W[hg];B[me];W[kk];B[ff]LB[jk:a][oj:b]C[However, next Black plays the counter-sente one point move of B193! It is hard to understand! After White simply pushes at 'a', Black's big group dies immediately, if Black reinforces at 'b', then Black would be a little favorable for the game and could win the game by a small margin.];W[ef]
