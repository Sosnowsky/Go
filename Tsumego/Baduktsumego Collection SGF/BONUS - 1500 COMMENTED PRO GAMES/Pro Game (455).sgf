Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[In the semi final of Mingren Title, the rising star Zhou Ruiyang 3p defeated Wang Haoyang 4p and advanced to the challenger final, hoping to challenge Gu Li 9p again.];W[pp];B[dc];W[cp];B[eq]
;W[od]C[W6 is rare, to approach the upper left corner or pincer attack B5 is common.];B[oc];W[nc];B[pc];W[nd];B[qf];W[jc];B[cm]C[Wang Haoyang perhaps wants to avoid the opponent's familiar opening, but in theories, allowing Black to pincer first with B13 is always not good.];W[do];B[cj];W[gc]LB[iq:a]C[W16: For White to pincer at 'a' is relatively better.]
;B[cr]C[Since B17 is related to both side's base, its value is huge.];W[fp];B[fq];W[gp];B[gq];W[hp];B[iq]C[Through B23, Black gains a big territory, but White is still not stable, the result is to Black's satisfaction.];W[ce];B[ed];W[bc];B[cg]LB[df:a]C[B27: The common move is to make the knight at 'a', this way Black can seal off White inside, this should be good for Black. The play in the game seems not good but very relentless, Black aims to obtain territory at the maximum limit.]
;W[dg]C[As to this, of course White still stick the head out with W28, it seems here White can fight.];B[ch];W[df];B[fe];W[fg];B[he];W[di];B[dj];W[je]LB[hg:a]C[The direction of W36 is wrong, since White is relatively thick at the top, to attack at 'a' is better.];B[gb]C[B37: Black exerts power here, a surprising tactic! Black wants to build base locally.];W[fb]C[W38: White gives tit-for-tat, its tactic is intense! Here it seems Black is very dangerous.]

;W[bb];B[de]C[B43 and B53 are two good diagonal moves.];W[cd];B[dd];W[ca];B[jf];W[ic]C[Through B57, Black captures one stone, although White captures two stones with W58, Black gets over a crisis nonetheless, Zhou Ruiyang's local fighting skill is very strong.];B[cf];W[hd];B[ie];W[em]LB[ej:a][ge:b]C[W62: White wants to exchange with B 'a', then W 'b'.]
;B[bf]C[As to this, the play of B63 makes White very difficult to answer! If White answers with W64, when Black's several stones at the top die, Black takes advantage with the exchange of B63.];W[ge]C[Therefore White again counterattacks with W64, here the sequence fits into both players' thinking, it is very interesting.];B[gf];W[ff];B[ee];W[gd];B[bd]C[After W68, although Black obtains some territory, but Black on the outside becomes thinner, as a result, White is not bad.];W[ej]LB[hh:a]C[But next W70 is Wang Haoyang's very regrettable move, White should first attack at 'a' in the center.];B[gg]C[B71 is alert!];W[gh]
;B[hh];W[hi];B[ih];W[ii];B[jh]C[Through B77, Black makes life in sente, Black is certainly very happy, the situation also turns to Black's favor.];W[gi];B[qn];W[ql];B[qq]C[B81 striking the corner is simple and clear, in this situation, to grab territory is more important.];W[qp];B[pq];W[op]

;W[mo]LB[in:a]C[W98 is a desperate tactic in an unfavorable situation, the original move is to connect at 'a', this way although White's situation is a little inferior, but White still can fight for a victory.];B[ok]C[B99 serving as ladder breaker is a clever move.];W[kn];B[qk]C[B101: Black attaches down, White's side territory has been destroyed, White's situation deteriorates.];W[pl];B[pk];W[ni];B[rl];W[rm];B[qi];W[qh]
;B[rj]C[B107 and B109 are good moves to make eyes, this group's eye shape is abundant.];W[ri];B[mk];W[sl];B[rk];W[pd];B[re];W[pn];B[lj];W[nf]C[After B117, White still needs to connect with dame move of W118, here White clearly fails in the fight.];B[jj];W[qc]

;W[mp];B[no]LB[nr:a]C[B135: Black is not soft-hearted, in fact for Black to descend at 'a' is already good enough.];W[nl];B[nn]LB[rh:a]C[Of course, Black plays this way since Black has the ko tactic at 'a', White is also not good.];W[nk];B[ol];W[om];B[nm];W[ml];B[rh]
;W[si];B[rg]LB[ll:a]C[B145 is a careless move, if Black hangs at 'a', White's situation will be even worse.];W[oj];B[ln];W[lr];B[ll];W[oq];B[or];W[nr];B[ns];W[mr];B[pr]C[Through B155, White can't make life at the bottom and has to kill Black's big dragon in the center, but this definitely can't be accomplished.]
