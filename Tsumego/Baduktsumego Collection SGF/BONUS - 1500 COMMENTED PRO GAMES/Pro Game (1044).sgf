;W[ed];B[jd]C[B7 and B9 are Gu Li's favorite and being "borrowed" by Lee Changho.];W[cd];B[pk];W[od];B[oc];W[nc];B[pc];W[me];B[pf];W[mb];B[fq];W[jc]LB[kc:a]C[The attachment of W20 is a good move. Here is the vital eye point for both sides and very important. So with B19 Black shouldn't take tenuki and should play at around 'a'.]
;B[ic];W[kc];B[gf];W[ef]C[As for the result up to W24, White is relatively satisfied.];B[cn];W[eo];B[cq];W[cp];B[dq];W[bq]LB[gp:a][fp:b]C[W30: If White directly makes the knight's move at 'a', Black will push and cut at 'b'. In the real game, the play of W30 is necessary.]
;B[br];W[bp];B[ck];W[gp];B[gq];W[hp];B[hq];W[ip];B[bd];W[bc];B[ek];W[he]C[The strike of W42 is the vital point for the shape.];B[hd]C[Black's defense with B43 is also very beautiful.]
;W[ge];B[ie];W[hf];B[if];W[hg]C[Through W48, both sides are roughly acceptable.];B[di];W[dh];B[ch]C[B49 and B51: Black seeks to dodge.];W[dj]C[White's answer following W52 is correct.];B[ei];W[cj];B[ej]
;W[bk]C[Especially W56 turning to the lower side is also the right choice.];B[cg];W[dk];B[eg];W[fh];B[eh];W[df];B[dg];W[el];B[fl];W[em]C[Through W66, the result is also to White's satisfaction.];B[be]
;W[fb];B[ig];W[qi]C[W70: White gets to invade first, White's situation is not bad.];B[qk];W[rf];B[qf];W[re]C[After this move, it is time for lunch break.];B[rg];W[qg];B[rh];W[pg];B[rd]
;W[ri];B[po];W[iq];B[nf];W[ob];B[qe];W[qh];B[se];W[sh];B[sf];W[oj];B[fc];W[ec]
;B[lg];W[ok];B[ol];W[nl];B[om];W[lh]C[As to White's provoke with W98, Black already can't retreat.];B[mh];W[mi];B[li];W[kh];B[nh];W[mj];B[lj]
;W[lk];B[ji]LB[jh:a][mk:b]C[When B107, White has the push at 'a', Black must play at 'b' to resist.];W[qm]C[When White probes Black again with W108, Black is a little difficult.];B[mk]C[B109: Black simply fixes his center defect first.];W[pl]LB[ml:a][kk:b][nk:c][rl:d][kl:e][qq:f]C[The cut of W110 is the losing move for the game. here White has made some miscalculation. In fact, with W110 if White simply answers at 'a', next B 'b' and W 'c', Black reinforces at around 'd',  then after W 'e', White can attach at 'f', this way White is favorable.]
;B[pm];W[ql];B[rk];W[qn];B[qo];W[ro];B[rl]C[B117 is a good move to kill liberties.];W[rm];B[rp];W[qp];B[pp];W[sp];B[rq]
;W[sn];B[sl];W[sm];B[pn]C[Through B127, it becomes ko-kill, Black achieves a big victory.];W[ml];B[kk];W[nk];B[kl]C[B131: Black again grabs one good point, White clearly fails.];W[pj];B[sq];W[qj];B[so]
;W[ar];B[ir];W[jr];B[hr];W[sp];B[dl];W[bh];B[bg];W[bi];B[so];W[ii];B[jj];W[sp]
;B[cl];W[aj];B[so];W[lf];B[kg];W[sp];B[ah];W[bl];B[so];W[lq]LB[kq:a]C[W158: White already has no mindset to fight, its shape is not right. If White simply hangs at 'a', the difference between two sides are not very big and White can continue to play endgame.];B[rn];W[cr]
;B[dr];W[bs];B[fp];W[kf];B[jh];W[fm];B[jq]C[The cut of B167 is the last fatal attack. Black captures one stone and already doesn't need to strengthen to make life.];W[kq];B[mn];W[ni];B[jp];W[jo];B[kp]
;W[lo];B[kr];W[ko];B[js];W[lp];B[jr];W[oh];B[gn];W[in];B[gl];W[qb];B[ag];W[ai]
;B[en];W[fn];B[fo];W[dn];B[km]C[Through B191, White incurs a big defeat.])
