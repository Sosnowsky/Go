;W[qo]LB[pl:a][lq:b]C[B7: If Black plays pincer at around 'a', White will split at 'b'.];B[op];W[qk];B[cf]C[The opening up to B9 is very common.];W[dh]LB[cc:a]C[B11: For Black to enter the corner at 'a' is also possible, ...];B[ef]C[..., but considering the big komi, I elected to play more positively.];W[fc];B[dm]
;W[do];B[gp];W[dq];B[ep];W[dr];B[dj];W[fh];B[gf];W[hh];B[if];W[ic]LB[jh:a]C[The two-space extension of W24 is the right move. If White jumps to 'a', Black will check at 24, which is very big.];B[jh]
;W[gk]C[The big knight of W26 is good move.];B[gm]LB[fn:a]C[Black can't tolerate if White makes knight at 'a' and can only jump with B27.];W[ik]C[White easily makes good shape with W28, White's big group basically is not easy to get attacked.];B[qi];W[pm]C[W30 is thick play, but White's speed looks slow.];B[qp];W[po];B[lp];W[qf];B[oi]
;W[of];B[qe];W[rg];B[nc]LB[nd:a]C[The knight's move of B39 is questionable, Black should jump to 'a', this will help the fight later on.];W[lg]C[The big knight's move of W40 is good move!];B[li];W[jg]C[B41 and W42 are miai, White has successfully separated White.];B[id];W[jc];B[hc];W[hb]
;B[ig];W[ih];B[ji]LB[jf:a]C[The exchange of B43 and B45 is to prevent White from pressing at 'a'.];W[kf];B[ed]LB[me:a]C[B51: Black's group on the left side is not too dangerous, with B51 Black should first make knight at 'a', this will echo Black on the left and right sides and also indirectly reinforces the corner. This way it will be a complicated game.];W[ec];B[cd];W[de];B[df];W[re]
;B[rd];W[qc];B[qd];W[ce];B[be];W[cc];B[ch]C[Black's sequence from B51 to B63 is the root cause of Black's bitter battle in this game.];W[ni]C[The attachment of W64 is severe.];B[nh]LB[nj:a]C[B65 again is wrong direction, to play hane at 'a' is a little better.];W[mh];B[mi]
;W[nj];B[ng];W[ne];B[mf]C[B71: Black has no choice but to make diagonal and capture W66 one stone.];W[me];B[lf];W[mg]LB[nf:a][le:b][rc:c]C[The exchange of W74 and B 'a' is bad. If White simply blocks at 'a', allowing Black to capture W66 one stone, then W 'c', Black is losing the game.];B[nf];W[le]
;B[oh];W[kd]LB[oe:a]TR[ni][nj]C[In the game, White itself adds cut point at 'a', and W64 and W68 (the marked two stones) also become heavy.];B[pk];W[pl];B[ok];W[nk];B[ol];W[lk]LB[ml:a]C[W84: For White to make diagonal at 'a' is a little better.]
;B[rk];W[ql];B[nm]LB[jk:a][rj:b]C[Through B87, B 'a' and 'b' become miai, White already can't take care of both, the situation has been turned around.];W[ri];B[jk];W[jl];B[kk];W[kl];B[ll];W[il];B[lm]
;W[rc];B[fj];W[gj];B[ij]LB[se:a]C[B99 is big bad move! If Black loses this game, it would be the losing move! Black tightens one of his own liberties, as a result, Black is being captured instead of capturing White. For Black to play atari at 'a' is just fine.];W[hj];B[fi];W[ii];B[jj];W[lj];B[rj]C[B105: It forms an exchange, but Black has no other choice, Black's territory is still not enough.];W[sd]
;B[rh];W[rp];B[rq];W[rn];B[sm];W[pp]LB[sq:a][sr:b][so:c]C[W112: For White to play at 'a' is simple and clear, next B 'b' and W 'c', making a ko. This way White can just simply play two moves on the outside.];B[qq];W[oq];B[or];W[nq]
;B[nr];W[mq];B[on];W[oo];B[no]C[White makes himself heavy.];W[sq]C[And the hane of W122 becomes gote.];B[mr];W[rr];B[qr];W[qs];B[pr];W[rl]

;W[jq];B[kr];W[jo]C[Through W144, White takes lot of advantage, but White's situation is still not optimistic.];B[cn];W[fg];B[bd];W[er];B[bo];W[bp];B[pf];W[pg];B[oe];W[pe]
;B[ki];W[mj];B[pf];W[og]LB[od:a]C[W158 is too strong. If White makes compromise at 'a', it would be still a close game.];B[pc];W[oj]LB[qb:a]C[But with W160 White tightens his own liberty, it is bad move. White should turn at 'a' to capture Black.];B[pj];W[qh];B[pi];W[sh]
;B[qj]LB[qb:a][rb:b][ra:c]C[Now White has to reinforce the center, Black has the tactic of playing double hane at 'a' and 'c', the situation becomes unclear.];W[mn]C[The strike of W166 is the last losing move!];B[nl]C[B167: Black gets to tighten one liberty, capturing White in the center, and White has no follow-up tactic on the right side.];W[mp];B[np];W[mo];B[nn];W[jr];B[ks]
