(;SZ[19]EV[7th LG Cup final game 2]DT[2002-02-28]PC[Korea]KM[6.5]BR[9p]WR[9p]PW[Cho Hunhyun]PB[Yoo Changhyeok]RE[W+R]C[Copyright by gogameworld.com and weiqi.tom.com.];B[pd]C[Black is Yoo Changhyeok 9P];W[dd]C[White is Cho Hunhyun 9P];B[qp];W[dq];B[nq]
;W[qj];B[ql];W[qf];B[mc]C[The opening up to B9 is often adopted by Yoo Changhyeok 9p.];W[oj]LB[rd:a][qd:b]C[W10: White has many choices, for example, making the knight's move at 'a' or attaching at 'b'.];B[qh]LB[pg:a][rd:b]C[Black invades immediately with B11, it is an asking move, if White makes the diagonal extension at 'a', then Black will jump to 'b'.];W[qn]C[W12 is "an eye for an eye", but initiating a fight in the place where Black has more stones is a little far-fetched, a fierce fight already can't be avoided, and it is also what all Go lovers are waiting for.]
;B[ol]C[B13 is a steady move. After the first game, Yoo Changhyeok becomes more confident.];W[on]C[W14 is also a common move.];B[op]C[The way of Black's strengthening with B15 is worth study.];W[rp]C[W16 is alert.];B[rq];W[qo];B[pp]C[Through B19, White can be satisfied.];W[rl]C[W20 is a simple play.];B[rm];W[qm]
;B[rk];W[pl];B[qk];W[pk];B[rj]C[Through B27, both sides have some profit, it seems that Black is more substantial.];W[qc]C[W28 entering the corner is inevitable.];B[qd];W[pc];B[od];W[rd];B[re];W[rc]
;B[om]C[B35: Black takes tenuki to attack first, it is a play taking the whole game into account, showing Yoo Changhyeok character of "#1 attacker".];W[pm];B[nn]C[Through B37, White's outside influence seems to have been come under attack.];W[oc]C[W38: Black doesn't accept Black's threat.];B[mj]C[B39: Black forces White to make life.];W[qi];B[ri];W[ph];B[qg];W[nm]C[The cut of W44 is good timing, if waiting after White makes life, White is worried that Black may sacrifice.];B[nl]
;W[mm];B[ml];W[lm];B[oo];W[pn];B[mo];W[pg];B[rf];W[of]LB[nd:a]C[W54: It is very obvious that White aims to hane at 'a'.];B[pi];W[pj];B[ni]
;W[oi];B[nd]C[B59 is the original move.];W[mg];B[kl];W[km];B[jl]C[The purpose of B61 and B63 is to open the center by attacking White.];W[in];B[do];W[hm]C[W66 is a mutual good point.];B[cq];W[dl]C[W68 is a good move according to the situation.]
;B[dr];W[eq];B[er];W[cp];B[dp];W[fq];B[bq]C[Through B75, Black gains a big territory.];W[li]C[White starts to attack Black with W76, it is White's deserved compensation. So far Black is leading in territory, White needs to make profit and take the initiative by attacking Black.

After this move, it is time for noon break.];B[jm];W[jn];B[kn];W[mn]
;B[no];W[ko];B[lo];W[ln];B[ll];W[kn];B[hl]C[The set pattern from B77 to B87 is the simplest play.];W[dn]C[W88: White probes Black first and then decides how to attack Black in the center.];B[cn]LB[co:a]C[B89: If Black plays at 'a' instead, it seems being taken advantage by White, in the game Black doesn't allow White to take tenuki.];W[eo];B[en]
;W[dm];B[ep];W[gl];B[hk];W[co]C[W96: White elects to do an exchange.];B[fp];W[gk];B[hi];W[bn];B[gq]C[Through B101, Black has gained some territory, but White obtains sente. White's only choice is to enclose territory on the left or upper side by attacking Black's weak stones in the center.];W[gj];B[ji]
;W[ih];B[kg]C[The counterattack of B105 is very fierce, but the risk is also not small.];W[ii];B[hj];W[jj];B[gi];W[jh]C[W110 prevents Black from attaching out here.];B[ei];W[fo];B[gp];W[im]LB[gm:a]C[W114 guards against Black's cut at 'a'.]
;B[jk];W[kc]LB[qe:a]C[W116 wants to force Black to connect back by playing the dame at 'a'.];B[ke]TR[kg]C[Black resists tenaciously with B117, it is also one of the purposes of the earlier marked black stone.];W[me]C[W118 is the vital point for the shape.];B[ld];W[ic]LB[md:a][qe:b]C[W120 is tight, Black couldn't strengthen two cut points at 'a' and 'b' cleanly with just one move.];B[hd]C[B121: Black attacks in order to defend.]
;W[hc];B[gd]LB[lh:a]C[After B123, the diagonal cut at 'a' becomes White's practical problem.];W[gg]C[W124 again is a counterattack in order to defend.];B[if];W[hf];B[id];W[eg]C[W128 again threatens Black's big dragon in the center.];B[gc]C[B129: This doesn't worry Black, it seems that Black is confident in living the big dragon.];W[il]C[Cho Hunhyun already enters into overtime, Yoo Changhyeok still has 8 minutes in the regular time.];B[ik]
;W[mb]C[W132 prepares for killing the dragon.];B[nb]LB[dg:a]C[B133 is clearly unreasonable,  Black should reinforce the dragon at 'a' in order to have a chance to win.];W[le];B[kd];W[nc];B[lb]LB[md:a][lh:b]C[Through B137, because White has the cut at 'a', Black's diagonal cut at 'b' is already not a threat to White any more.];W[fj];B[fi];W[dh]C[W140: White starts to kill the dragon.]
;B[gm];W[fm];B[gn];W[go];B[ej];W[fl];B[lh]C[B147: Black puts the last trap for White.]
(;W[kh]LB[mh:a][ki:b][kj:c][ij:d][lg:e]C[If W148 at 'a', then B 'b', W148 and B 'c', next 'd' and 'e' become miai, Black must get one, White is no good. Yoo Changhyeok also enters overtime.];B[di];W[ci]C[W150 is tight.];B[ch];W[cg]C[W152 is the right move, Black doesn't have chance to make trouble.];B[cj];W[bh]
;B[bi];W[ch];B[lg];W[mh]C[Through W158, Black's dragon was tragically killed, Black has to concede defeat. The game 3 will take place on 3/27.])
