;B[qo];W[op];B[ql]C[From the small diagonal extension of W6 and the two-space extension of B7, we can see both sides are very careful.];W[nc]LB[oc:a][od:b]C[Kong Jie has thought about 16 minutes for the move W8, he clearly overrules the approach at 'a' or 'b', which would easily lead to a fierce fight.];B[pc];W[kc];B[ic];W[ke];B[cn]C[This game proceeds very slowly, now both sides already prepares to fight a prolonged war.];W[fq]
;B[bp];W[fc]TR[ke]LB[ne:a][cf:b][cm:c]C[W16 is a positive move, please notice the position of the marked stone, if the marked white stone at 'a', then White may not play this way. For White to play at 'b' is also playable, followed by  B16 and W 'c'.];B[ec];W[fd];B[df];W[ie]C[Chang Hao: Can't agree with the play of B17 and B19, after White captures one stone with W20, there is no reason why White is no good. With B17, for Black to jump to 20 or attach at 18 is better.];B[ff]LB[jq:a][fb:b][eb:c][cq:d]TR[ic]C[Black almost didn't hesitate to play B21, this move aims to pull out the marked black stone, only in terms of territory, for Black to play at 'a' is the biggest move.

Chang Hao: B21 is inexplicable, making Black to lose the efficiency of playing first very earlier on. With B21, Black can directly play hane and connect at 'b' and 'c' or make the diagonal extension at 'd'.]
;W[iq];B[ld];W[jc];B[fb]LB[ck:a]C[With B25, Black strengthens the upper left corner, for Black to make an extension at 'a' is also a good point.];W[gb];B[eb];W[cl];B[cq];W[co];B[bo];W[dn];B[bn]
;W[dm];B[gc]LB[hc:a][gd:b][hb:c][ge:d][jp:e]C[The cut of B35 is too slow, after W 'a', B 'b' and W 'c', Black still has to strengthen at 'd', Black spends too many moves in the upper left.

Chang Hao: B35 can be considered as the losing move of this game. Black spends three moves locally but Black's profit is very limited. Black certainly should make the shoulder-hit at 'e' or play at 'c' if Black wants to play locally.];W[pn]C[Chang Hao: W36 is a huge move.];B[qq];W[qr];B[rp];W[ln]C[W40: White forms a moyo at the bottom.]
;B[rr];W[pr];B[jn]LB[kl:a][jp:b][im:c][jq:d][ir:e][mp:f]C[After the reduction of B43, both sides will fight a big war here, for example W 'a', B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e' and B 'f', this kind of fight would be headache for both sides, and most likely this fight will decide the game. 

Chang Hao: B43 is already one step slow.

So far, Black has used 55 minutes, White 2 hours and 15 minutes.

After this move, it is time for noon break.];W[im]LB[jm:a][jl:b]C[W44 is the most severe attack, if B 'a', then W 'b', Black is unreasonable.

Chang Hao: W44 is a clever move.];B[km]
;W[kp]LB[qm:a][rm:b][rl:c][rk:d][pl:e][sl:f][qk:g]C[With W46, White first protects his lower side, if White plays the sequence of W 'a', B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f' and W 'g', Black is not optimistic.

Chang Hao: W46 is a steady move.];B[in];W[dr];B[dq];W[eq];B[cr];W[ik]
;B[lm];W[pl];B[qm];W[pm];B[po];W[oo];B[hm];W[hl];B[jm]C[B59 and B61 are slow moves.];W[qk]C[W62: White elects to take territory first and not to attack Black strongly, it is related to personal styles.

Chang Hao: White is able to hane with W62, White is already leading in territory.];B[pk]C[The cut of B63 was criticized by observers.];W[rk]
;B[qn];W[pj];B[ok];W[oj];B[nl];W[qf]C[White gets to play at 70, it seems White's tempo is not bad.];B[on]LB[oe:a][ml:b][mk:c][mm:d][ll:e][nm:f]C[B71: If Black defends at 'a', then W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 'e' and W 'f', White is better.]
;W[nn];B[om];W[oe]LB[ne:a]C[W74 is a good move.

Chang Hao: Black captures three white stones and White gets to cap with W74, the game is already over. With B71, Black should cap at 'a', this way B23 may still have some room for action.];B[nb];W[ob];B[oc];W[mb];B[nd];W[na];B[mc];W[nb];B[rf]LB[rg:a][re:b][pg:c][od:d][mf:e][pb:f][ch:g]C[After B83, if W 'a', B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f' and W 'g', White would be favorable, but the current problem is that Kong Jie is under time pressure.]

Black still has about 20 minutes left in the regular time, Kong Jie is already in overtime, when B 'a', W 'b' and B 'c', White doesn't need to fight the ko, if W 'd', B 'e' and W 'f', White wins the game for sure.]
