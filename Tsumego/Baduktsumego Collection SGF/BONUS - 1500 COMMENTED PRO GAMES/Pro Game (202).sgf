Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd];W[pp];B[cp];W[dd];B[oc]C[The opening of B1, B3 and B5 is rarely seen in recent years, I also play this opening not often, just want to try some new opening.]
;W[eq];B[hp];W[do]LB[en:a]C[W8: For White to jump to 'a' is the most common.];B[co]LB[dp:a]C[B9: Black can also push and cut at 'a', the play in the game is simple and clear.];W[dn];B[cm];W[jp]LB[cq:a][dp:b][ep:c][dq:d][dr:e][cr:f][cn:g][bn:h][bm:i][bo:j][cl:k]C[Since White is not favorable in ladder breaker, White can't attach at 'a' (B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f', then W 'g', B 'h', W 'i', B 'j' and W 'k', White can't capture B11 in the ladder).]
;B[fo];W[dp];B[cq]C[Black is happy with the exchange of W14 and B15.];W[dm];B[cl];W[dl];B[dk];W[ek];B[ej];W[fk]C[The sequence from W16 to W22 is inevitable.];B[fm]C[The jump of B23 is the vital point.];W[gn]
;B[fn];W[gq]LB[fl:a][gm:b]C[Although the counterattack of W26 is a little far-fetched, now it is just a state of mind, if White simply strengthens at 'a' to exchange B 'b', White will be very painful.];B[hq]C[The block of B27 is inevitable, in the game I feel Black has many choices, but if allowing White to cross over, Black is too passive.];W[gp];B[go];W[ho];B[gr];W[fp];B[io];W[hn]
;B[jo];W[im];B[kp]LB[jq:a]C[B35 and B37 appear efficient but in fact are questionable, with B35 for Black to simply attach at 'a' is just the right move.];W[jq]LB[kq:a][ir:b][hr:c][kr:d][lr:e][lq:f]C[W38 is a strong move, Black is not easy to capture the two stones. If Black blocks at 'a' strongly, next W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 'e' and W 'f', this way Black is very dangerous.
];B[lq]C[The diagonal of B39 is the best move locally.]
;W[lr];B[kr];W[ir];B[mr]LB[ip:a][hr:b][jr:c][iq:d][ko:e][fr:f]C[B43 is not careful and precise enough, if Black simply connects at 'a', next W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 'e', W 'f' and B43, this way Black is thicker.];W[hr];B[ip];W[jr]
;B[ko];W[ck]LB[ik:a][dj:b]C[The atari of W48 is sharp, if White reinforces at 'a' to capture four black stones, Black will connect at 'b', Black's situation is not bad.];B[dj];W[cn];B[bn];W[bk];B[bl];W[ci];B[dr];W[kq];B[ls]
;W[fr];B[hl];W[il];B[ik];W[kl];B[dh]LB[gj:a]C[B61 and B63 are questionable, to jump at 'a' simply is light and nimble, the play in the game seems heavy.];W[ch];B[df];W[eh];B[fh];W[eg];B[dg]
;W[di];B[ei];W[ef];B[ee];W[gg];B[de];W[gi]C[W76: White captures four black stones, White's potential in the center is very big, White is favorable.
];B[gh];W[fi];B[hh];W[gf]LB[he:a][if:b][ff:c][hf:d]C[W80 is miscalculation, Hu Yaoyu thinks when B 'a', White's jump at 'b' is the right shape (if White jumps to 'b', Black can first wedge at 'c', then push at 'd').]
;B[he]C[After Black nets with B81, the situation suddenly becomes closer.];W[hf];B[ie];W[if];B[jf];W[ge];B[gd];W[je];B[hd];W[ke];B[kf];W[le];B[lf]
;W[me];B[ng];W[ic];B[hb];W[od];B[ig];W[fj];B[nd]LB[ec:a][pd:b][of:c][cd:d]C[If Black loses, B101 will be the losing move. In the game, I overlook the severeness of W 'a'. Black should bump at 'b', next W 'c', Black obtains sente and can strengthen at 'd' to capture W4, Black's situation is not bad.];W[of]
;B[ne];W[mf];B[nf];W[mg];B[kk]C[In the game, I think, the attachment of B107 is good tempo.
];W[ec];B[fc];W[ib]C[W108 and W110 are severe, White makes life W4 and also threatens Black's big group, this makes a big difference if Black reinforces one move.];B[bd];W[bc];B[be];W[lk]LB[cd:a][bb:b][cc:c][ac:d][ab:e][aa:f][ad:g][ae:h][cb:i][da:j]C[Following W114, White misses a good chance, White should continue to bump at 'a', next B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f', W 'g', B 'h' and W 'i', this way White makes life in sente (White has the tactic of playing diagonal at 'j'), Black's big dragon is still not alive. Black's territory is clearly not enough.]
;B[jk];W[km];B[lj];W[mj];B[mi];W[li];B[kj];W[mk];B[lh];W[ni]LB[lb:a][lg:b][cd:c]C[W124 is the last losing move, White still should bump at 'c', W 'a' and 'b' are miai, White must get one, White's big group is not dangerous.]
;B[mh];W[lb];B[cc]C[Black gets to strengthen with B127, Black's clearly leading in territory.];W[qi];B[pq]C[Black's sequence following B129 is very simple and clear.];W[qq];B[op];W[po];B[oq];W[oo];B[ln];W[mo]
;B[mn];W[nn];B[mp];W[mm];B[oi];W[oj];B[nh];W[pi];B[nj];W[nk];B[rh];W[ri];B[qr]C[Although White encloses territory on the right side, Black takes advantage in sente with B141, then grabs the biggest endgame with B149, Black's victory already can't be overturned.]
;W[nb]C[The counterattack of W150 is inevitable.];B[mc];W[mb];B[ob];W[rf];B[rq]C[W154 and B155 are miai big endgames.];W[qp];B[qf];W[cd];B[bb];W[cb]C[W158 and W160 are forcing moves under time pressure, White obviously loses ko threats.];B[ac]
