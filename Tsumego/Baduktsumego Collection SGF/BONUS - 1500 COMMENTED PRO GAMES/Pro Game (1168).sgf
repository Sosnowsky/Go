;W[mj];B[hn]C[Through the exchange to 65, White is very thick on the right, but Black's territory on the lower side is huge, the focal point now is, how much territory White need to enclose on the left and top side in order to contend with Black's territory.];W[fd];B[ik]C[B67 is good point for both.];W[gl];B[im];W[hj]LB[ce:a]C[W70 at 'a' to protect the corner is better and solid.];B[cd];W[ce]LB[cc:a]C[W72 would like to hane at 'a'.]
