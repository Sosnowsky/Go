;W[mn];B[qh];W[oh];B[qk];W[lq]LB[qo:a]C[With the knight's move of W24, White hopes Black to attach at 'a' immediately, this way Black's stones ('a' and B23) will fight with each other.];B[ok]C[Therefore, Black takes tenuki and jumps with B25, it is an inevitable counterattack.];W[nq]LB[qp:a]C[W26 makes Black too comfortable, with W26 White should make the diagonal extension at 'a'.];B[qo];W[qn]
;B[ro];W[rn];B[pp]LB[ni:a]C[B31: Black can consider to take tenuki and make the knight's move at 'a', now White can't initiate the ko fight, White will be relatively difficult.];W[mk];B[pn];W[nm];B[ol]C[However, in the real game, Black is also not bad, B33 and B35 make White very painful.];W[po];B[mo];W[lo];B[no]
;W[om];B[pg]C[After Black counterattacks with the diagonal of B41, Black takes initiative in the fight.];W[pf];B[og];W[ng];B[nh];W[oi]LB[ni:a][nf:b][qg:c]TR[of][pf][qf]C[White can only resist with the sequence following W46, if White plays atari at 'a' first then connects, then Black can cut at 'b' in sente and reinforce at 'c', White's three marked stones will be captured.]
;B[ni];W[qi];B[qg];W[ri];B[rf];W[nj];B[mg];W[nf];B[oj];W[pi];B[rh]LB[rj:a][pk:b]C[Black blocks with B57 and captures five white stones, this is the right play, it leads to an exchange, although Black is not bad either, but anyway White avoids one crisis. If B57 at 'a' instead, White can play at 'b'.]
;W[rk];B[lh]LB[rl:a][ql:b][pl:c][sl:d]C[In this process, if Black hanes down at 'a' with B59, next W 'b', B 'c' and W 'd', leading to a ko fight, but White has ko threats on the outside, Black is not good.];W[ql];B[lj];W[lk];B[jd];W[gc];B[iq]LB[rq:a][lp:b][hd:c]C[B65 is to guard against W 'a', this way Black can wedge at 'b' to reinforce indirectly. However, for Black to play at 'c' is more urgent.]
;W[ke]C[In the game, White invades with W66, White's situation takes a better turn.];B[mf];W[kd];B[cn];W[cm];B[dm];W[bm];B[cl];W[dl];B[bl];W[bn];B[cj];W[el]

;W[eh];B[cc]LB[bf:a]C[Black enters the corner with B93 to probe White, it is an overplay! To make the diagonal at 'a' is the original move.];W[bh];B[be];W[bf];B[bd];W[cf];B[eb];W[fk];B[md];W[jc];B[fi]
;W[gk];B[hl];W[hk];B[il];W[jh];B[ii];W[ik];B[ji];W[hn]LB[ko:a][rq:b]C[In the real game, Black incurs loss in the exchange, White's questionable move is W112 jumping out two stones, allowing Black to clamp at 'a' to form an exchange, the aji at 'b' in the corner is all gone, White incurs loss.];B[jl];W[kj]

;W[jm];B[lp];W[mj];B[li];W[jj];B[ij];W[kk];B[gg];W[fg]C[Because Black on the left side is captured, it is too big, the whole game is still to White's advantage.];B[hh];W[hg]LB[gf:a][ff:b]C[W138 is a big mistake! White should play atari at 'a', next B138 and W 'b', sacrificing two stones, this way White will win by a small margin.]
;B[gf];W[hi];B[ih];W[eg];B[ic]C[The hane of B143 is severe.];W[ib];B[jb];W[kc];B[hb];W[id];B[ia]LB[hc:a][hd:b][gb:c]C[With B149 Black certainly should connect at 'a', next W 'b' and B 'c', it is huge, this way the outcome of the game is still hard to imagine.]
