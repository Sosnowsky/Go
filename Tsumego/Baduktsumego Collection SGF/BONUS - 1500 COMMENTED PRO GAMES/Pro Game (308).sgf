;W[cn];B[ip]C[Not sure why the opening from B1 to B7 starts to show recently, it seems that Korean players pay relatively more attention to the study of opening.];W[qj]C[W8 is an attitude of preparing for a prolonged war.];B[qg];W[qm];B[qn]C[But the attachment of B11 is fierce.];W[rn];B[ro];W[qo];B[pn];W[rp];B[rm]
;W[so];B[ql]LB[pm:a]C[After White hanes down, the exchange is inevitable. Because Black needs one move to take at 'a', so the result is not good for Black.];W[op];B[nq];W[pq];B[pr];W[qq];B[jd]LB[ol:a][pm:b]C[B25: Black is tenacious, the original move is to reinforce by jumping at 'a' or take at 'b'.];W[np]LB[ke:a]C[It seems that White takes advantage in sente with W26, in fact that's not the case, White should make the shoulder-hit at 'a' as a ladder breaker, once the ladder stone escapes, the exchange of W26 with B27 is damaging for White.]
;B[mq];W[lc]C[W28: White invades and lives inside, then Black is no need to be hurry to reinforce the ladder stone.];B[le];W[pc];B[oc];W[ob];B[qc];W[pb];B[od];W[qb];B[rc];W[mc]LB[nc:a][rb:b]C[W38: Usually White will hane at 'a', but in the game White is still not alive. Therefore, with W38 White should crawl at 'b' instead.]
;B[kb];W[rb];B[fc];W[cf];B[mp]LB[ok:a][dr:b]C[B43 is weird! For Black to make the knight's move at 'a' is the right move. Moreover, flying inside at 'b' is also big.];W[ge];B[hc]LB[lb:a][ic:b]C[As to W44, the play of B45 is very bad! The original purpose is eyeing for White's life-and-death, in fact Black has miscalculated. With B45 Black should crawl at 'a' then make the diagonal extension back, it is sente.];W[fp]
;B[er];W[eq];B[fr];W[dr];B[cq];W[dq];B[gp];W[fn];B[lb]C[The sequence following B55 is inertia.];W[mb];B[nc];W[nb];B[sb]
;W[kd];B[ke];W[jc];B[jb];W[me]LB[mf:a][qd:b][nf:c]C[But the sequence from W60 to W64 is clever, Black already can't kill White, if Black plays hane at 'a', then White cuts at 'b' in sente and counter-hanes at 'c', Black is no good.];B[qe];W[kc];B[ic];W[je];B[id]

;B[og];W[nf];B[oh];W[pe];B[qd];W[of]C[With the sequence from W66 to W88, White lives completely, White is favorable for the game.];B[cm]C[With the sequence following B89, Black incurs loss again in order to capture two stones in a ladder, White's advantage has been enlarged.];W[bm];B[dn];W[cl];B[dm];W[co]
;B[ig];W[go];B[hp];W[dl];B[hi];W[qh];B[rg];W[mh];B[lh];W[mi]LB[oj:a]C[W102 and W104 are mistakes, after Black jumps out at 'a', White has no follow-up maneuver, White should jump to 'a', which is the urgent point at this situation.];B[oj];W[ok]
;B[nj];W[nn];B[nm];W[gi]C[W110 is tight!];B[gh];W[fh];B[gj];W[fi];B[hk];W[mm];B[om];W[ko];B[jp]
;W[ml]C[White first settles the pattern with the moves from W116 to W120, it is beautiful!];B[pk];W[gg]C[When White plays atari of W122, the game is still to White's advantage.];B[mo];W[in];B[hm];W[hh];B[ih];W[ji]C[W128 is unnecessary.];B[jh];W[mn]LB[hn:a][ii:b]C[W130: White should attach back at 'a', this way Black would still have the cut point at 'b', it is a Black's hidden trouble eventually.]
;B[hn];W[on];B[cc];W[dc];B[db];W[cd];B[ek];W[el]LB[dj:a][bb:b][sm:c][rl:d][ol:e]C[W138 is the losing move! White should enclose at 'a' instead, next B 'b', W 'c', B 'd' and W 'e', this way White still can keep a slight advantage.]
;B[dj];W[cb];B[bk]LB[ci:a]C[B141: For Black to play at 'a' is the right move.];W[bi];B[ca];W[bb];B[fl];W[cj];B[di];W[eb];B[po];W[pp]
;B[dg];W[cg]LB[ch:a][df:b][ci:c][sm:d][fb:e]TR[bk]C[W152 is the losing move! White should peep at 'a', Black connects, next W 'b' and B 'c', Black connects back the marked stones in gote. Then White plays atari at 'd' and crawls at 'e', this way the outcome of the game is still hard to imagine.];B[bh];W[ck];B[ch];W[fb];B[bj]C[Black's moves following B157 are all sente.]

;B[qr];W[rr];B[pm]C[After Black takes with B173, Black already wins the game for sure, in the following endgame Black is a little conservative, but it has nothing to do with the result.];W[jl];B[lk];W[mk];B[mj];W[ol];B[pj];W[kj];B[lj];W[il];B[ii]
