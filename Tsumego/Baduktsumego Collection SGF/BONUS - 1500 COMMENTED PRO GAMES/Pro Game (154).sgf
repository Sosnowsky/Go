;W[od];B[oc];W[nc];B[pc];W[dh]C[White first approaches to the corner with W6 to exchange for B7, then White plays two-space high pincer of W10, it is tempo of playing.];B[fe];W[fc];B[ed];W[ec]LB[gc:a][de:b]C[I think, W12 is more powerful then two-space extension at 'a', the reason is forcing Black to exchange B13 and W14, if omitted, White can attach and cut at 'b'.
];B[he]
;W[cl]LB[ic:a][ck:b]C[W16 is questionable, to make extension at 'a' is the right move. Even if making extension on the left, to play at 'b' is better.];B[ic];W[cd];B[bd];W[bc];B[nd]C[Black flies with B17 in sente, then cut with B21, Black's shape is thick and Black can be satisfied.
];W[qj]C[W22 making extension on the side is imperative.];B[qh]LB[md:a]C[B23 is very big, but to make extension at 'a' is more solid.]
;W[jd]C[The invasion of W24 is good move.];B[md];W[jc]LB[cj:a]C[The exchange of B25 and W26 should be reserved, to invade at 'a' directly is more powerful.];B[cj];W[gf];B[ge];W[cg]C[The counterattack of W30 is positive, due to the addition of W26, Black's few stones are very weak.
];B[ej];W[fi];B[hf];W[el]
;B[fk];W[ei];B[jf];W[ib]C[After the exchange of B37 and W38, White becomes safe, so Black doesn't need to exchange this for now, later on Black can take chance and block crossover at 38.];B[di];W[de]C[After W40, White's two groups have connected already.

;B[fl];W[dn];B[fp];W[cp];B[cq];W[co];B[bq];W[hn];B[hp]C[Following B45, Black takes some profit by attacking three white stones.];W[qn]C[But White obtains sente and makes knight with W56, the situation now is even.

After this move, the game was closed for noon break.];B[nq];W[kq]LB[pr:a]C[The invasion of W58 is the only move! If White defends at around 'a' passively, Black will make extension back at 58, White's situation is not optimistic.]
;B[pr];W[qq];B[op];W[hr];B[gq]LB[gn:a][kn:b]C[W62: White takes profit in sente, White looks happy, but it may not be good. Due to the addition of B63, Black's wedge at 'a' is working, perhaps with W62 for White to jump at 'b' is the right move.];W[kn];B[po];W[qo];B[pq];W[qp];B[fm]
;W[em];B[gn];W[go];B[gm];W[fo];B[ho];W[in];B[iq];W[no]C[As to B77, W78 attacking Black on the right is correct.
];B[oo];W[nn];B[qr];W[rr]
;B[lp];W[kp];B[lo];W[ln]LB[lq:a][pm:b][mq:c][om:d][rl:e]C[If White loses this game, W86 is the losing move! How come I missed the vital turning point at 'a'? This way Black can only escape at 'b', next W 'c', B 'd' and W 'e', Black's big group is still not alive, however White captures two stones B83 and B85, White's situation is not bad.];B[ko];W[jo];B[lq]C[In the game, Black blocks with B89, Black is already alive, however White still needs to connect, the more fatal is, this is related to White's life-and-death on the left side.];W[ir]
;B[eo];W[en];B[gr]LB[fr:a]C[B93: Black loses the chance to win the game at one stroke, Black should hang at 'a'.];W[dq];B[eq];W[dr];B[er];W[hq]LB[fr:a]C[If B93 at 'a', White can't take advantage with W94 and W96, White can only reinforce the cut at 98.];B[gp];W[ip]
;B[dd];W[cc];B[bj]LB[cf:a][bk:b][ao:c]C[In this game, I overlooked the descent of B103 (If White takes tenuki with W104, Black can bump at 'a'). I only thought, if B 'b', White has the clever move at 'c'.];W[bh]LB[al:a][am:b][ao:c][cm:d][cf:e]C[If no W94 and W96, when B103 and W104, B 'a', W 'b' and B 'c', White's big group will die unconditionally.

Due to the addition of W94 and W96, White can live by taking at 'd', please see the variation.]

;W[il];B[al];W[am]LB[bm:a][bn:b][an:c][cm:d][bo:e][bp:f]C[Since the mistake of B93, the situation becomes even again, after B119 and W120, if B 'a', then W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 'e' and W 'f', it is two step ko for Black, and Black is damaging in points, Black is also reluctant to play this ko.
];B[oh]LB[ik:a]C[B121: For Black to press at 'a' is the original move.];W[ii]C[Being capped with W122, Black can only make White thick in order to connect together, Black is very painful.]
;B[bm];W[bn];B[ik];W[jk];B[hi];W[hh];B[ij];W[ig]LB[jj:a][ih:b][ji:c][gh:d][gi:e][hg:f][gk:g]C[W130 is unnecessary, White should block at 'a', next B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f' and W 'g', it forms a worry-free ko, White is clearly favorable.]
;B[ji]C[After Black ataris out with B131, this situation is again chaotic.];W[ih];B[jj];W[cf];B[je];W[hl];B[fj];W[kh];B[kk];W[jl];B[jh];W[jg];B[kg]
;W[li];B[lg];W[gj];B[gi];W[gh];B[hj];W[kj];B[gk];W[lj]LB[lk:a]C[W151 to exchange with W152 is the last losing move. Black certainly should simply make life, later on Black can extend out at 'a', the outcome of the game is difficult to imagine.];B[fg];W[fh];B[bl]
