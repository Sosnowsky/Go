In the first game of best-of-7, Yoda won by only half point.];W[od]C[W2: White starts to challenge right away, it seems that this big war will be brilliant.];B[dp];W[pq];B[cd]

;B[dd]C[The fight starts with B19 in the upper left corner.];W[ec]LB[ic:a]C[W20: Because there is no black stone at around 'a', White has the state of mind to initiate a fight immediately.];B[db];W[eb];B[da];W[cf];B[ee]LB[df:a][cg:b]C[B25: Black should hang at 'a', White prepares for a severe attack so White definitely will retreat at 'b', then Black hangs at 25, this way Black's shape would be much better.];W[df];B[de]
;W[gd]C[After W26 and W28, Black sinks into a bitter battle.];B[ef];W[dh]LB[gf:a]C[The jump of W30 is no good, White should grab the vital point at 'a'.];B[eg];W[di];B[gc];W[hd];B[ea];W[fd];B[hg]C[In the game Black takes the vital point with B37, Black's situation takes a better turn. In the process,  B33 and B35 are very thoughtful moves, the purpose is not allow White to settle down easily.];W[gb]
;B[jc];W[jd];B[ic];W[hc];B[cj]C[Through B43, the fight is still spreading.];W[dj];B[ck];W[dk];B[cm];W[dl];B[gf];W[id];B[jf]
;W[cl]LB[kc:a][co:b][do:c][cn:d][dn:e][bm:f]C[W52: For White to hane at 'a' instead would be steady, even if White wants to invade, White should simply play at 'b', if B 'c', then W 'd', B 'e' and W 'f', this way although the fight is complicated, but White can fight adequately.

White couldn't hane at 'a', because of Black's clamp at 'b', White's four stones will get captured.

After this move, the game was closed for the first day.]
;W[fn];B[gp]LB[gq:a]C[B67: For Black to extend out at 'a' is good enough.];W[gm];B[gl];W[gq]C[In the game, W68 and W70 are good moves! White seems to have taken a better turn.];B[hp];W[eq];B[fr];W[dq]LB[ep:a]C[W74 is not good, White should simply connect at 'a'.]
