Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[pd]C[In the first round, Kong Jie 7p defeated Hikosak Naoto 9p very luckily, at the crucial moment, the opponent miscalculated, otherwise the result is difficult to guess.];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[fq]
;W[cn];B[fc];W[df];B[pk]C[The opening from B1 to B9 is very fast, ...];W[ec];B[jd];W[fd]C[......, but W10 and W12 are very thick, the situation is even.];B[jp];W[nc]TR[jd]C[The direction of W14 is correct, since White is thick on the left side, White can start to attack B11 (the marked black stone).];B[oc];W[nd]
;B[pf];W[ld];B[jf];W[mg];B[kg];W[mi]LB[og:a]C[W22: White should jump to 'a'.];B[og]C[After the diagonal of B23, White is a little painful.];W[ki]LB[lg:a]C[W24: White underestimates Hikosaka's strength. From strength's viewpoint, Kong Jie can definitely win the game in the second half, for White to play at 'a' is steady.];B[me]C[B25 is severe, the situation enters into close-contact fight, White is very dangerous.]
;W[ne];B[gd];W[gc];B[hc]C[B27 and B29: Black borrows strength.];W[fb];B[mf]C[Then Black bumps and cuts with B31, the order is clever.];W[ke];B[nf]C[B33 makes White's shape collapse!];W[je]C[Following W34, White pushes and cuts desperately, making sacrifice already can't be avoided.];B[ie];W[if]C[White really doesn't want to sacrifice this way, however White doesn't have any other choice.]

;W[hf];B[mb];W[hj];B[hi];W[gj];B[jh]C[B55 is the vital point, the liberty is tight, must be careful.];W[nb];B[ob];W[ij];B[gi];W[fi];B[na]C[B61: Black captures ten stones and establishes superiority at one stroke.]
;W[go];B[hp];W[po];B[qp];W[lo];B[dr]LB[cm:a]C[The order of B67 and B 'a' is inexplicable, if White wants to destroy White's moyo, Black clearly should directly attach at 'a' with B67.];W[cq]C[The exchange of B67 and W68 is not good for Black to make life.];B[cm];W[ck];B[fj]C[The play of B71 should be reserved.];W[fk]TR[cm]C[After the atari of W72, White becomes very thick on the outside, B69's room for maneuver (the marked stone) has reduced dramatically, Black incurs loss.]
;B[op]C[B73: Black turns to fight on the right side, Black's tempo looks chaotic.];W[lq];B[mp];W[lp];B[kr]LB[mo:a][jq:b]C[The shape of B77 is not right, considering later on Black will push and cut at 'a', with B77 for Black to play at 'a' will help the fight.];W[oo]C[W78 is strong and unyielding, White's situation takes a better turn.];B[mo]LB[bk:a]C[The timing of B79 is not right, if Black first does some preparations, like attaching at 'a', White is very hard to deal.];W[pp]

;W[jo];B[io];W[in];B[kl]LB[jl:a]C[Here perhaps Hikosak didn't notice, when B97, White has good attachment at 'a'! here Black can't extend liberties, Black unexpectedly dies.];W[qq];B[qr]LB[rq:a]C[If knowing Black will die, with B99 Black also should play at 'a'. If the game still proceeds as the real game, Black may not lose the game.];W[jl];B[bk]C[B101: Now Black comes to attach, it is already late.];W[bj]C[White's sequence following W102 is very steady.]
;B[co];W[dn]C[If White tries to kill Black strongly, Black can borrow strength from the center, White is painful.];B[bn];W[do];B[bl];W[ej];B[cj];W[ci];B[aj];W[bi];B[bp];W[bq];B[am]C[White allows Black to make life a small group.]
;W[lr];B[hn];W[im];B[ho];W[cl];B[dm];W[fm];B[dk];W[dj];B[ak];W[ro]C[Then White settles the shape in sente from W116 to W126.];B[rq];W[qi]C[White grabs the last big point of W128, the situation has been turned around.]
;B[oi];W[rk];B[kq]LB[nk:a]C[B131: Black should play at 'a', this way Black can still make some troubles for White.];W[nk]LB[hb:a][pi:b]C[After White simply jumps with W132, the big endgame 'a' and 'b' become miai, White must get one, White is simply in a winning situation.];B[nj];W[mj];B[ls];W[mr];B[nr]
