;B[ck];W[gn]LB[go:a][cn:b]C[The striking move of W20 is an asking move, if Black connects at 'a', White will make the diagonal extension at 'b' to fight a direct confrontation with Black.];B[fn];W[dk];B[dj];W[cj]LB[go:a]TR[ho][dm]C[In the game, White is left with the advantage of pushing at 'a' to capture the marked black stone, then the marked white stone can be treated lightly, this is also the purpose of W22 and W24.];B[bl]LB[cl:a][ci:b][ej:c]C[B25: Black wants to extend at 'a', if W 'b', then B 'c', this would be better than the real game.]
;W[ci];B[dl];W[ek];B[el];W[nc]C[W30: White takes tenuki, treating the left side lightly and seeking speed, for White to extend at 'a' is also possible.]LB[fk:a];B[fk]C[B31 is a huge move, Black's play has nothing to criticize.];W[ej];B[di];W[cg];B[dh];W[qc]

;W[pf];B[nd]C[However, through B51, White's unusual opening seems to have achieved a good result.];W[pi];B[qk];W[jd];B[id]LB[jc:a]C[B55: Black should crawl at 'a', trying to cross over is better.];W[jc]C[The attachment of W56 is a strong move, which may be overlooked by Black.];B[je];W[ib];B[hb];W[jb]
;B[if]LB[ke:a][hc:b]C[B61: If Black extends at 'a', then White has the tactic of playing the cut at 'b'.];W[ke];B[kf];W[le];B[lf];W[me];B[lc]C[After this move, the game was closed for the first day.];W[mc];B[md];W[lb]

;W[bk];B[cl];W[pb];B[pg]LB[nf:a][mg:b]C[B87: To double up at 'a' to exchange for White's extension at 'a' can be used as ko threat, although Black would have more ko threats, but it is too crude and Black can't play this way. In the game, it means Black will eliminate the ko threat no matter what ko threat White will find.];W[oe];B[qb];W[he];B[ne];W[nf];B[og];W[re]
;B[ra];W[qg]LB[ie:a][rg:b][qf:c]C[W96: It is hard to understand White doesn't play atari at 'a', when Black jumps to 'b' on the right side, White can live by descending at 'c'. The play in the game equals to letting Black eliminate the ko without any condition.];B[qh];W[rg];B[ie];W[nh];B[nq];W[qp];B[qo];W[pq]

;W[bf];B[rp];W[qq];B[jp];W[li];B[eb]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.];W[db];B[qi];W[pj];B[ph];W[qj];B[rj];W[rk]
;B[ri];W[rl];B[pk];W[nj];B[qm];W[jg]LB[ok:a][om:b][bj:c]C[W134 is too small! White should exchange W 'a' and B 'b', then connect at 'c', this is the biggest endgame.];B[bi];W[ag];B[bj];W[ok]
;B[om];W[ol];B[pm];W[ji]LB[jr:a]C[The jump of W142 is inexplicable! Not sure why Yoda is such care-free! At least White should make the knight's move at 'a'.];B[ir];W[ip];B[jo];W[rm];B[rn];W[ng];B[ql];W[jq]
