;W[cn];B[kq]C[B1 to B7 forms the common varied "Chinese Fuseki".
];W[qj];B[pk]C[The diagonal of B9 is Korean players' favorite play.];W[qk];B[pl];W[ql];B[qm];W[qg];B[rm]LB[pj:a][pi:b][oi:c][ph:d][rl:e][rk:f][nc:g]C[B15: Black can also press at 'a', next W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 'e', W 'f', B15 and W 'g', this variation was popular for a while.]
;W[pj];B[nk]LB[nc:a]C[The jump of B17 is rarely seen, the common move is to protect the corner at 'a', White invades in the lower right corner.];W[nc]C[The corner-approaching of W18 is inevitable, since Black takes tenuki in the upper right corner, White certainly should punish.];B[nd]LB[ko:a]C[B19: Black wants to reinforce at around 'a', this way Black's moyo at bottom is very significant. Of course, Black also takes risk. But in the real game, Black follows White and plays in not so valuable places.
];W[md];B[ne];W[oc];B[pc];W[re]C[W24 is the vital point for shape, not only making life himself and also threatening Black's whole group.]
;B[qe];W[rd];B[qf]C[White forces Black to play crude moves of B25 and B27, it seems White can fight.];W[rf];B[pg];W[qh];B[kd];W[le];B[nh]LB[lb:a]C[B33: Black should first make knight at 'a', this way Black can take advantage, then Black can connect with B33.];W[ke];B[lb]C[After White presses with W34, B35 making knight now is already one step late.]
;W[jd];B[jc];W[ic];B[jb];W[ib];B[mc];W[ie]LB[mb:a][lc:b][nb:c]C[W42: If White plays atari at 'a', next B 'b' and W 'c', the fight will be to White's advantage but complicated.];B[ld];W[ce]C[The diagonal of W44 is very big.
]
;B[gf]LB[ko:a]C[B45: For Black to jump at 'a' is common, this way it will be a long game.];W[fg]C[Black probes with B45 and is being counterattacked by W46, here it leads to an unexpected fight.];B[gg];W[gh];B[hh];W[hg];B[hd];W[id];B[hf];W[ig];B[fh]
;W[gi];B[eg]LB[ff:a][ee:b][eh:c][fi:d][ef:e][df:f][dg:g][fe:h][if:i]C[B57: White faces choices. If White escapes at 'a', next B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f', W 'g', B 'h', W57 and B 'i', it will lead to a very complicated fight.];W[fi]C[W58: White again makes compromise, White clearly fails in this local fight. White's situation is not optimistic.

White makes comprise twice (W42 and W58). It seems Hu Yaoyu is not in the right state.];B[ff]
;W[fd];B[ei];W[dh];B[eh];W[fk];B[if];W[jf];B[cg];W[ck];B[ej]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.];W[oq]C[The invasion of W70 is inevitable, here is the key for the game. Black is thick on the board.];B[pq]
;W[pr];B[qr];W[lp];B[lq];W[mp];B[kp];W[ln];B[ko];W[pp];B[qq];W[nl];B[ll]C[W82 and B83 are all good moves for shape.];W[mk]
;B[ml];W[nm];B[kn]C[After B87, White is leading slightly in territory but very thin on the board. Black is still favorable.];W[ok];B[nj];W[pm];B[pn];W[om]C[Through W92, White dodges successfully, the situation becomes much closer. Black must take some profit by attacking White in the center, now the game becomes a long and endgame fight.];B[dl];W[cl];B[fo];W[dm]C[W96 is a good and calm move.]
;B[fj];W[dr];B[eq];W[dq];B[cc]C[B101 is early preserved tactic.];W[dc];B[bd];W[be];B[db]LB[eb:a][bb:b]C[After B105, if White plays hane at 'a', then Black can ko-live at 'b', this way Black can exert power by using his thickness, also if White loses the ko fight, White's whole group may die, so Black almost lives unconditionally.];W[eb]
;B[bb];W[da];B[ca];W[cb]C[W110: It forms a ko fight, which is very important.];B[gd];W[gb];B[db];W[me];B[nb];W[cb];B[em];W[en];B[db]
;W[ja];B[kb];W[cb];B[eo]C[B123 is a clever ko threat.];W[fm];B[db];W[lc];B[kc];W[cb];B[el];W[ek];B[fn];W[dk]
;B[db]LB[dn:a][cm:b]C[B133: Black should take at 'a', after W 'b', then Black takes the ko, White doesn't have enough ko threats.];W[fl]LB[dn:a]C[W134 eliminating the ko is inevitable. If White continues to fight ko threat and Black takes at 'a' as ko threat, White can't continue the game anymore. So far, Hu Yaoyu already enters into over time, his situation is not good. If White can make life in the upper left corner, it is still a close game.];B[ea];W[gj]LB[fa:a]C[W136 is a bad move under time pressure. In terms of points, to play atari at 'a' is bigger, and it is also related to big dragon's well-being!];B[jg];W[ih];B[fb]
;W[fc];B[ec];W[gc];B[ee];W[ed];B[de];W[cd];B[cf]LB[ii:a][jh:b][kg:c][ji:d]C[B147: Black misses a good chance, Black should play atari at 'a', next W 'b', B 'c' and W 'd', then B147, White's big dragon will die.];W[eb]
;B[fa];W[ga];B[da];W[kg];B[jh];W[ii];B[ji];W[ij];B[jj];W[ad];B[bc];W[mi]C[W160 is good move to make life.
];B[mh]
;W[ba];B[aa];W[lh];B[li];W[mg]C[Through W166, White makes life, but White's situation is still a little inferior. The board becomes smaller, White's chance is less. W136 is still a big mistake.];B[lj];W[nf];B[er]LB[op:a]C[B169: Black should first play atari at 'a', this way Black wins for sure.];W[hn];B[ho];W[ch]
;B[bh];W[bi];B[hm];W[gm];B[gn];W[hl];B[im];W[dg];B[df];W[bg];B[bf];W[ah];B[af]
;W[ae];B[fe];W[po]C[W188 is worth 10 points in counter-sente, Jo HanSeung overlooks this place.];B[do];W[co];B[ds];W[cs];B[es];W[cr];B[op];W[qn];B[rn];W[or]
;B[qo];W[oo];B[mr];W[of]C[Through W202, White is slightly favorable.];B[ob];W[jk];B[kk];W[il];B[kh];W[lg];B[jm];W[qb];B[sj]
;W[rj];B[qc];W[rc]C[White most likely will win by half point.];B[sl];W[sk];B[rk];W[rl];B[on];W[no];B[nq];W[np];B[ps];W[sk]
