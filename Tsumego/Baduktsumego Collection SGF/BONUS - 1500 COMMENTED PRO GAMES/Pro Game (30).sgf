;B[ep];W[hp]C[The two-space high pincer is a challenge, Chinese players have more advanced study on the "Great Slant" joseki, Japanese and Korean players all have suffered losses on this joseki to Chinese players.];B[en]C[B7 is a simple answer, Black cunningly avoids the "Great Slant" joseki. Zhou Heyang once made Lee Changho suffer miserably with this joseki, it seems Lee Changho still have a lingering fear.];W[cn];B[kp];W[hn];B[nq];W[el]C[W12 is unexpected, Chang Hao obviously wants to crash the opponent with momentum.]
(;B[dm]LB[cq:a][dq:b][dp:c][cr:d]C[B13: If Black attaches underneath at 'a', Black worries about White's counter-measure of W 'b', B 'c' and W 'd' (see var a).];W[eq];B[dq];W[dp];B[fq];W[er];B[fo];W[dr]C[White takes the corner territory with W14 to W20 and can be satisfied.];B[cm]
;W[dj]C[W22 is a good move, neither close nor far, leaving Black at a loss as to how to proceed.];B[fl]C[B23: Black wants to run out over here.];W[fk];B[gl];W[gn]C[W26: Black tries to wreck Black's shape.];B[fm]C[Although Black has suffered a little bit with the play of B27, but White needs to watch out for Black's future counter-attack. So far, White's two groups on the left and right side are all vulnerable, how to handle the situation is a difficult problem.
];W[kn]C[W28 is the vital point.];B[gk]C[B29 is a very thick play, aiming to strike later.];W[ce]C[W30 approaching the corner is inevitable.];B[ed]TR[gk]C[B31 is a well-correlated play to the marked black stone.]
;W[fj];B[gj];W[fi];B[bj]C[With B33 and B35, Black first flattens White's territory at the top and then gains profit on the side, making White uncomfortable.];W[ck];B[bk];W[ci]LB[em:a]C[W36 and W38 are good sequence plays, eyeing for the squeezing and cutting at 'a'.];B[iq];W[hq];B[fr]C[B39 and B41: Black has settled his shape, but ends in gote.];W[ir]
;B[jq];W[gr];B[fs];W[bm];B[bl];W[bn]LB[cr:a][cq:b][ds:c][br:d][bs:e]C[The hane and connection of W46 and W48 prevent Black's tactic of making a ko by the sequence of B 'a', W 'b', B 'c', W 'd' and B 'e' (see var a).]
(;B[cl];W[no]C[White gets the chance to play the knight's fencing-in move at 50 and can be satisfied.];B[ln];W[km]C[W52: White sticks his head out the play is fluent.];B[im];W[in];B[ko]C[B53 and B55 are good moves to fix the shape.];W[il];B[mo]C[Black is very happy with the tiger move at 57.];W[hh]C[W58 is the mutual good point.];B[ik]
;W[jl];B[ii];W[nn];B[pr]LB[lm:a]C[B63 can't be omitted, if trying to get out at 'a', Black may come away with gote.];W[lm];B[bi];W[ch];B[qq]C[B67: Black aims to keep the balance in territory.];W[hi];B[hj];W[jj]C[W70 aims to take advantage with sente.]
;B[jk];W[kk];B[kj]LB[hl:a]C[The counterattack of B71 and B73 is absolute. B 'a' is somewhat sente, so Black's big group has no life and death problem. So far it is lunch break time. After reviewing the current situation, Nie Weiping 9p commented on the game: Chang Hao is positive in the fight, while taking White, he is not falling behind and can be satisfied.]
(;W[ki]LB[ji:a][ij:b][ih:c][hl:d][lj:e][jm:f][jn:g]TR[il][jl]C[Nie Weiping thinks W74 is a bad move, White should directly retreat at 'a', followed by B 'b', W 'c', B 'd' and W 'e', White lives, afterwards if Black ataris at 'f', White can connect at 'g' and sacrifice the marked two white stones, White is not bad in this variation (see var a). In the real game White has missed this sequence.];B[lj];W[ji];B[ij];W[ih]
;B[hl];W[hm]TR[ki]C[Through W80, Black lives with sente, thanks to the improperness of the marked white stones.];B[lk];W[kl];B[oc]C[B83: Black protects his corner and it is very substantial, Black has no choice but to go all out for territory with the 8-points komi.];W[bh];B[ai];W[mh];B[pi]C[B87 is a good move, in this juncture White has no time to capture Black's three stones in the center. Through 87, Black's speed is faster, White's moves following W74 seem cumbersome, but due to the big komi, the game is still up in the air.];W[hc];B[cd]C[W88 and B89 are miai, each side gets one good point.]

;B[ri];W[rk]LB[kh:a][lf:b]C[W124 and 126: White elects to obtain sente by sacrificing, because Black has the option of pushing through at 'a' and cutting at 'b', Black has no danger, so White's sacrificing is clever.];B[qi];W[qp]C[W128: White blocks in sente and is very happy.];B[rq];W[be]C[W130 aims to gain profit in sente.];B[gb]C[B131: Black seeks to obtain sente.];W[gc];B[hb]
