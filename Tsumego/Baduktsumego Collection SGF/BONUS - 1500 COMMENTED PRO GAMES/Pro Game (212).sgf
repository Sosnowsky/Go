;B[df];W[fd];B[ck];W[jp];B[jd]LB[cc:a]C[B9: Black aims to attach at 'a'.];W[qf];B[cc];W[cd];B[dd];W[bc];B[ec];W[cb]
;B[ed];W[eb];B[fc];W[gp];B[do];W[qn]C[W22 is a good move, White protects the corner while watching how Black will act.];B[pi];W[of];B[qe];W[rf];B[nd];W[ni]C[W28: White starts the slow attack on B23, and at the same time enters into the center, White's tempo is very smooth.]

;W[nr];B[mr];W[cq]C[W44 is an asking move, White also seeks to create some ko threats, however it may be damaging if not controlled properly.];B[er]C[B45 is very strong and brutal, reflecting Rui 9p's style.];W[jm];B[nq];W[dr];B[ep];W[mq];B[jo]C[The play for both sides in the center is very light and nimble, it is hard to find an effective measure for attack, from the standpoint of the real game result, the attachment of B51 is not a good choice.];W[ko];B[kn]
;W[io];B[jn];W[in];B[kp];W[jq];B[im];W[jl];B[hm];W[gn]C[Through 62, Black doesn't achieve any clear success on the battlefield. After this move, it is time for noon break.];B[pn];W[qo];B[hk];W[fq]
;B[cr]C[W66: White has no other alternative, this move is very mischievous.];W[ln]C[W68 is a good move, exposing Zhan Xuan's sharpness.];B[km];W[lm];B[kl];W[ll];B[kk];W[lk];B[lo];W[jk]LB[kj:a][lj:b][jj:c][nn:d]C[W76 is a surprising good move, if Black extends to 'a', then W 'b', B 'c' and W 'd', this would be bad for Black (see var a).]
(;B[no];W[kj];B[ko];W[nq]LB[jj:a][lj:b]TR[fd]C[After W80, it seems that White has many cut points, but the cut at 'a' or 'b' is not effective, the position of the marked white stone is just right.];B[gr];W[fr];B[fs];W[hr];B[ir];W[gq]
;B[hs];W[gs]C[Through 88, a ko fight results, because White has so many local ko threats, Black is hard to win the ko fight.];B[mj]C[B89 is not good timing.];W[mk];B[gr];W[hq];B[jr];W[gs];B[nj];W[nk]LB[oo:a]C[After W96, the tactic of White's hane move at 'a' becomes effective.];B[gr]
;W[kr];B[kq];W[lr];B[nm];W[oj]C[Through 102, White has gained a big profit in the center fight.];B[hn];W[ho];B[fo];W[go];B[ok];W[oi];B[pj];W[gs]
;B[ng];W[mi];B[gr];W[en]C[W114: White seeks to make life and at the same time destroy Black's territory, White is very happy.];B[nf]C[The push and cut of B111 and B115 is not that severe.
];W[qc]C[W116: White turns to enter the corner, again showing Zhang Xuan 8p's flexible style.];B[re];W[oc];B[pc];W[pb];B[nc];W[nb]
;B[od];W[ob];B[rc];W[rb];B[qd];W[qb];B[sb];W[lc];B[oh];W[ij]C[After White reinforces with W132, White only needs to simply reduce Black's center, White is not bad.];B[fl];W[gm];B[gl]
;W[dn];B[cp]C[B137: Black has no choice, otherwise after White extends to 137, Black would be unable to deal with the situation.];W[gs];B[gi];W[ih];B[gr];W[ik];B[hl];W[gs];B[kc];W[lb];B[gr];W[dl]
;B[hi];W[ii];B[gs];W[dk]C[After White presses out with 152, White is already leading.];B[cj];W[dj];B[di];W[ei];B[dh];W[eo];B[rk];W[ql];B[cm]

;B[hb];W[ha];B[gc]C[B201 and B 203: Black resists staunchly.];W[ib]TR[sh]C[If White has imagined that there will be a ko fight, then earlier the crawl of the marked white stone should be reserved, it is an excellent ko threat.];B[ga];W[ao];B[aq];W[gb];B[qm];W[rm];B[ga]

;B[on];W[gb];B[ks];W[ms];B[ga];W[mn];B[nn];W[gb];B[db]LB[bd:a][ba:b]C[B233 is a little bit damaging from the professional point of view, if Black has the chance to squeeze at 'a', then after B 'b', the corner could be seki.];W[da];B[ga]
;W[hg];B[hf];W[gb];B[jh];W[ji];B[ga];W[fh];B[ig];W[gb];B[hc];W[bd];B[af];W[md]
;B[ne];W[ga]C[White has made a positional judgement by gaining time with the consecutive forcing moves, W250 is the declaration of victory.];B[fg];W[ic];B[id];W[eh];B[eg];W[iq];B[is];W[an];B[lf];W[kh];B[mh]
;W[jg];B[kg];W[lh];B[hh];W[lg];B[mg];W[je]C[The attachment of W268 is the biggest endgame, worth 3 points.];B[jf];W[ke];B[ie];W[am];B[al];W[de]
;B[ee];W[fj];B[fm];W[fk]C[Rui Naiwei is forced to concede defeat, Zhang Xuan is leading by 1:0 in the best-of-3 final. From B81, Black has placed too much hope on the lower left ko fight, Zhang Xuan has handled the weak stones very clearly, it looks like Black is busy to make life, actually the ko instead has become Black's burden, in the end although Black wins the ko, but White has already stalked off and in the mean time wrecked Black's territory. Zhang Xuan has given a full play of her resilient style, in contrast, it seems that Rui Naiwei 9p's strength and power is not utilized in the right places.

The game 2 will take place on 3/9.])
(;B[kj];W[lj];B[jj];W[nn]C[This would be bad for Black.]))
