;W[qj];B[fc];W[cf];B[qh]C[The opening up to B9 was played many times between them.];W[qm];B[jd]LB[db:a]C[B11 is variation, in the past it was at 'a'.];W[hc]LB[oj:a]C[With the invasion of W12, White puts emphasis on territory, to play at 'a' is also a good point.];B[pl]C[B13 is the follow-up tactic of B9.];W[ql]
;B[pj];W[pk];B[ok];W[qk];B[pi];W[ol];B[hd]LB[nk:a][pm:b]C[B21: The common move is to extend at 'a', taking tenuki and aiming to pull out at 'b' is Gu Li's unique style.];W[nk];B[oj];W[ic];B[id]
;W[jc];B[de]C[B27 is superficial.];W[ee]LB[ce:a][kc:b][gc:c]C[W28: If White simply answers at 'a', then B 'b' and W 'c', White can't connect with the left side and fall into the trap.];B[kc];W[kb];B[gc];W[lc];B[kd];W[mb]
;B[hb];W[ia];B[dc]C[B37 is the tesuji to take the corner.];W[cc];B[ed];W[cd];B[df]LB[ef:a][ce:b][fe:c]C[B41 is to obtain sente, but this way Black's local loss is very big, Black can consider to play at 'a', next W 'b' and B 'c'.];W[dg];B[ef]
;W[ce];B[pm];W[qo]C[W46 is common tesuji to dodge.];B[pp];W[nl];B[pn];W[ro];B[nn];W[eg];B[ff];W[jp];B[jn];W[me]C[W56 is good point! Black's moyo at the top has been reduced a lot.]
;B[nc];W[mc];B[do];W[co]LB[gq:a]C[W60 is overplay! Here if White can connect with the weak W54, White is happy, so White should jump at 'a'.];B[dp];W[cp];B[eq];W[cn];B[dr];W[cq];B[hq]C[After B67, W54 comes under attack and White is painful.]
;W[hp];B[gp];W[ho];B[iq];W[jo];B[kn];W[hm];B[em];W[er];B[fr];W[dn];B[fo]C[B79 is light, now to keep pressure on White is important.];W[ep]
;B[fq];W[il];B[nb]C[B83 is huge, not only protecting the corner and also not allowing White to live, this kind of one-stone-multiple-purpose play is a place both sides must fight for.];W[fn]LB[kl:a]C[W84 is impulsive, this tactic is not severe now, White should play at 'a', eyeing from afar, taking chance to act is better.];B[fg];W[fh];B[fj]C[B85 and B87 are good thinking!];W[gh];B[en]C[After the addition of B87 by playing cleverly, Black becomes favorable in the direct confrontation with B89.];W[eo]
;B[gn];W[go];B[fp];W[fm];B[gm];W[fl];B[gl];W[el]LB[gk:a][fk:b][hk:c][ik:d]C[W98 is overplay, White should play at 'a', next B 'b', W98, B 'c' and W 'd', this way the center is safer.];B[gk]
;W[hn];B[hi]LB[hj:a][ij:b]C[B101 is not good, Black didn't expect the good move of W 'a', Black should play at 'b', White is in a bitter battle.];W[hj]C[W102 is sharp! It is just the vital point of Black's shape, just become of this move, White takes initiative.];B[gj];W[ij];B[eh]LB[gi:a]C[B105: Black is clearly reluctant to connect with dame at 'a', after cut, Black also can't see clearly, but in this game-deciding place, you can't be weak.];W[ei];B[dh];W[cg]
;B[di];W[gf]C[W110: White fights back by borrowing strength.];B[gg];W[hg];B[fe];W[hh];B[ii];W[gi]C[After the cut of W116, Black's situation is dangerous.];B[ih];W[ig]LB[if:a][dj:b][jj:c]C[But W118 is bad, if W 'a', then B 'b' and W 'c', Black can't kill White at the top and is not good.]
;B[jg];W[jf];B[kh]LB[jh:a][kf:b][if:c][ie:d][ik:e]C[B121: Black misses a good chance! Black should connect at 'a'! Next W 'b', B 'c' and W 'd', then Black wedges at 'e', White is very difficult!];W[kf];B[if];W[ie];B[dk]LB[ik:a]C[B125: For Black to wedge at 'a' is still better, this way Black can continue the fight.]
;W[jj]C[W126: White reinforces defect in sente, Black sinks into a dire strait.];B[fi];W[hf];B[ki];W[cj];B[dj];W[bi]LB[ck:a]C[Perhaps happiness comes too fast, next White makes a big mistake! With W132 White should tight the liberty at 'a', this way Black reduces too liberties comparing to the real game, in a capturing race with outside, these two liberties are too important!];B[cl];W[bm];B[ck];W[cm]
;B[jk]C[B137 is not-easy-to -find vital point! Within 30 seconds, Gu Li sees this move, enough to show his excellent talent.];W[hl];B[le]C[B139: Black separates and first keeps one dead group in the mouth, even if sacrificing, Black can also win.];W[lf];B[mf];W[mg];B[nf];W[lh];B[kj];W[ng];B[of];W[og]
;B[pg];W[ni];B[oh]LB[nj:a][mi:b][lk:c][ib:d]C[But Gu Li's killing intention heats up, with the casual B151, Gu Li wants to take some advantage. If B151 at 'a', next W 'b' and B 'c', White can only extend liberty at the bottom, Black can kill the top at 'd', this way the game will be subject to whether White can find a loophole in the upper-right corner, the variation will be very complicated, the outcome of the game is difficult to guess.];W[kl]C[W152: White is forced to strike back, Black's key stones unexpectedly have no way to escape!];B[mi];W[pf];B[qf];W[mj];B[ll]
