Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[In the second round of LG Cup, Chen Yaoye 4p (Black) who participates a world competition for the first time meets Lee Changho 9p as he wished.];W[dd];B[pq]C[The opening of B1 and B3 is very popular nowadays.];W[oc];B[kd]
;W[pe];B[qe];W[pf];B[qg];W[ic];B[je];W[dp]C[W12: White takes tenuki in the upper right corner and grabs the empty corner, Lee Changho's play is very positive.];B[ne];W[oe];B[hd];W[qo]LB[lc:a]C[When Black presses with B15, White approaches the corner with W16, because White prepares to make extension at 'a'.]
;B[fc];W[lc];B[cf];W[ec];B[fd];W[cd]C[The play W20 and W22 is light and nimble. Perhaps Lee Changho thinks Chen 4p is still not mature yet, trying to play an unfamiliar shape, but he doesn't know Chen 4p is young and fearless.];B[kc];W[kb];B[nd]LB[jb:a][lb:b]C[B25 is powerful. If Black plays hane at 'a' usually, White will connect at 'b', Black's shape is stagnated and Black also ends in gote.];W[qf]C[The push and cut of W26 is a necessary sequence.]
;B[rf];W[re];B[rd];W[rg];B[se];W[pb];B[qh];W[mb]C[Through W34, both sides get some profit.];B[qm]LB[ef:a][eb:b][db:c][gb:d][jb:e][be:f]C[B35: Black can consider to strengthen at 'a', later on when having a chance, Black can play hane at 'b', next W 'c' and B 'd', making a miai of B 'e' and 'f' to threaten White's corner, Black will get one to play.]
;W[ck];B[fq];W[dq];B[eb];W[db];B[ed]C[The atari of B41 is a crude move, Black loses some variations in the corner.];W[dc];B[iq];W[df]C[W44 is good timing.];B[dh];W[dg];B[cg]
;W[eh];B[di];W[bi]C[Through W50, White's tempo is not bad.];B[de];W[ce];B[ee]C[The wedge and cut of B51 and B53 are inevitable counterattack, but White has the addition of W52, White becomes thicker.

After this move, it is time for lunch break.];W[eg];B[bh];W[ci];B[ch];W[gh];B[dk]
;W[dl];B[ek];W[ei]C[After W62, White takes chance to enclose territory on the left side and in the corner. Lee Changho often plays like this to control the outcome of the game.];B[cj];W[bj];B[dj];W[cl];B[el];W[em];B[fm];W[en];B[hk];W[ih]
;B[kh];W[ij];B[hj];W[hi];B[ji];W[ii];B[jl];W[kg];B[lh];W[hf];B[id];W[jc];B[jg]
;W[pp]C[After White handles his big group in sente with W80 and W82, White again deals with his stones in the lower right corner quickly with W86.];B[qq];W[np];B[nr]LB[oq:a]C[B89 is slow, Black perhaps can consider to extend at 'a', this way White is not easy to get the good shape with W94 in the game.];W[pm];B[ql];W[pn];B[ok];W[mm];B[fn]C[B95: Black accumulates strength.];W[jh]
;B[gb];W[ea];B[fa];W[fb];B[eo];W[do];B[eb];W[da];B[lg]C[But through B105, it appears White makes life his big dragon in the center in sente.];W[lo]C[W106 is the vital point for the shape. The game enters into Lee Changho's tempo.];B[er];W[dr]
;B[mp]C[In this crucial moment, Black starts to exert power with B109.];W[mq];B[nq];W[lq];B[ff]C[Black starts to destroy eye with B113. Lee Changho perhaps doesn't think the opponent has killing intentions.];W[kj];B[ki];W[ig]LB[fg:a]C[W116: If White blocks at 'a', White feels wronged, but this way White is safe.];B[fg]C[After Black destroys eye with B117, the game will be decided by this life-and-death ko in the center.];W[jf]
;B[kf];W[ik];B[il];W[ie];B[jd];W[lf];B[jg];W[kk];B[kl];W[kg];B[ke];W[he];B[jg]
;W[gj]C[Under Black's strong attack, White is a little rush, W120 and W132 handling ko threats are not careful and precise enough.];B[gk];W[kg];B[fj];W[gi];B[jg];W[mk];B[ll];W[ml];B[lk];W[kg];B[dn];W[dm]
;B[jg];W[lj];B[mj];W[kg];B[op];W[no];B[jg];W[mi];B[nj];W[kg];B[oo];W[nn];B[jg]
;W[ni];B[oi];W[kg];B[kp];W[lp];B[jg];W[hc]LB[li:a][ng:b][og:c]C[However W164 is Lee Changho's last losing move. White should connect at 'a', this way when W 'b', Black can attach and cut White as in the game with 'c'. Therefore Black can only connect by jumping at 'b', White takes the ko again. This way the game is still complicated, White would still have a chance to win.];B[if]C[B165: Black continues to take the ko, delivering White the fatal attack.];W[gd]
;B[ge];W[gc];B[hg]LB[jb:a]C[After Black initiates the ko with B169, B 'a' becomes a very good local ko threat.];W[jf];B[jb];W[ib];B[if];W[oj];B[pj];W[jf];B[ia];W[ja]
;B[if];W[nk];B[oj];W[jf];B[hb];W[ha];B[if]C[When Black takes the ko with B185, White can't find a proper ko threat on the board.];W[li];B[gf];W[ng];B[og]C[After Black attaches and cuts with B189, White wins the game by killing White's big dragon.

Chen Yaoye 4p advances to the final eight.])
