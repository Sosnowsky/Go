Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[jj]C[Although Li Zhe 4p is still young, his games are very interesting, in this game against Chen Yaoye, he used "Tengen fighting tactic" and won the game, not sure what other interesting opening he will bring later on.];W[dp];B[qd];W[dd];B[pq]
;W[oc];B[mc];W[qh]C[As to the tight pincer of B7, B8 turning the body around is a good move, if facing the fight directly, Black's Tengen stone will be put into use.];B[qj];W[pe]C[B9: Black tolerates White's press of W10, it is rarely seen.];B[qe];W[pf];B[qf];W[pg];B[qb]C[Black's purpose is after B15 Black still can attack White's outside influence, this is Li Zhe's unique thinking.];W[mf]C[W16 first making himself thick is necessary.]
;B[kd];W[kf];B[id];W[gc]C[W20 is a very happy move! Normally you can't allow the opponent to play here.];B[oj];W[if]C[With the jump of W22, White succeeds in the opening fight. In theories, taking Tengen point first is playable, but in real games, it is very hard to control, normally you will fall behind unconsciously.];B[gd];W[fd];B[ge];W[hc];B[ie];W[lj]LB[jb:a]C[W28: For White to play at 'a' is better, not only taking Black's base and also reinforcing himself, one stone for two birds.]
;B[lg];W[lf];B[oh]C[B29 and B31 are sharp! Black aims at White's weak point in shape, making White very uncomfortable.];W[lh];B[nd];W[od];B[mh];W[mg];B[li];W[mi];B[kh];W[nh];B[ph]
;W[og];B[cd]C[B43 making ko threats is a good move, since the burden of the all-dominating ko in the center, it is reasonable for White to retreat a little bit.];W[cc];B[dc];W[ec];B[db];W[de];B[ce];W[ki];B[bc];W[eb];B[cb];W[jb]
;B[df]C[B55: Black hanes in the head, the exchange result is about even.];W[ef];B[ee];W[fe];B[ji];W[lh];B[gg];W[ed];B[dg];W[eg];B[ig]LB[gi:a]C[B65 is not good, for Black to stick the head out fast at 'a' is better.]
;W[hf];B[gf];W[dh];B[fi];W[ch];B[bg];W[bh];B[cn];W[co];B[dn];W[fp];B[dj];W[fn]
;B[fl];W[qg]C[The value of W80 is huge, so far, White's situation is not bad.];B[qn];W[jq];B[cq]LB[lq:a]C[The original move of B83 is to play at 'a', in the game, Black grabs the territory aggressively, meaning Black feels pessimistic about the situation.];W[bo];B[eq];W[fq];B[fr];W[ep];B[er]
;W[gr];B[br];W[ql]C[The invasion of W92 is severe!];B[pm]C[Since White is thick in the surroundings, following B93 Black has to make compromise inconveniently.];W[rj];B[rk];W[qk];B[ri];W[rl];B[sj];W[ok];B[rm]
;W[sl];B[pj];W[ol];B[rg];W[rh];B[sh];W[nq]C[White grabs the last big point with W108, White is favorable for the game.];B[np];W[mp];B[no];W[oq];B[pp];W[rf]
;B[sg];W[hl]C[W116: White takes advantage in sente.];B[gk];W[pr]C[W118: White again gets to play hane-and-connect, Chen Yaoye's tempo is very good, instead Black must pound at White's weakness at the bottom, otherwise Black has no chance to win.];B[qr];W[or];B[mk];W[ml];B[mq]C[B123 is an asking move.];W[mr];B[lq];W[lp]C[W124 and W126: White doesn't give an inch, you got to play bravely when seeing clearly.]
;B[kp];W[kq];B[ll];W[lk];B[nj];W[nk];B[mj];W[lm];B[nm];W[nl];B[kl];W[mm];B[km]
;W[lo]C[W140: Although White is inconvenient, White gets to connect home, Black doesn't gain any meaningful advantage.];B[kn];W[ln];B[gq]C[B143: Black gives White the last test.];W[gp];B[hq];W[hr];B[hn];W[gm];B[hp];W[iq];B[go]
;W[im];B[in];W[kk]LB[en:a]C[W154: Unfortunately, White seems to make miscalculation here. In fact, White doesn't need to chase-and-kill Black, White can win the game easily by seeking life at 'a'.];B[hm]C[B155 is a good move.];W[jl]LB[gl:a]C[W156: White is still not thinking right. Now White can only play at 'a', this way White may still have chance.];B[gl]C[After B157, White's big group is being captured.];W[jn];B[hk];W[il]
