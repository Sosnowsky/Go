;W[ee];B[ef];W[ed];B[oc];W[df];B[dg];W[cf];B[cg];W[eg]LB[be:a][bf:b]C[For W14 to play the diagonal move at 'a' is usual,  but in the game perhaps Hane Naoki 9p thinks Black's stones are more effective this way due to lack of one move in Black's shape, so he selects fighting. Zhou Heyang 9p suggests another move at 'b', this play is hard to think of, it belongs to a blind spot, but in this shape, it is specially powerful, because locally Black is missing one move and couldn't block on the second line to initiate direct confrontation, Black will be difficult to answer.];B[ff];W[eh]
;B[bf];W[ce];B[be]C[Black ataris twice in a row over here, gaining a huge profit.];W[cd];B[cj];W[gg];B[cl]C[Through 23, in the study room, Hua Yigang 8p considers that Black's configuration on the whole board is vivid, the game enters Luo Xihe's tempo. (Luo Xihe: regarding the current position, Ma Xiaochun 9p and me think Black is not bad, but Wang Lei 9p thinks White is better.)];W[qo];B[qj]C[B25 again is a typical play of Luo Xihe's style, very unique.];W[ql];B[jd]LB[oj:a]C[B27 is an absolutely perfect spot. (Luo Xihe: B27 should jump to 'a'.)]
;W[qh];B[oi]C[Hane Naoki is in deep meditation ......];W[oe]C[The cap of W30 seeks to turn around.];B[qf]LB[md:a]C[B31 can also be considered to play at 'a'.];W[nc];B[nd]LB[nb:a][ob:b][mc:c][pb:d]C[B33 at 'a' may be more solid, followed by White's cut at 'b', B 'c', W 33 and B 'd', Black can fight.]

(see var a)];W[lg];B[kb]LB[jh:a]C[(Luo Xihe: B47 should jump out to 'a'.)]
;W[kh];B[gd]C[B49 is obviously unreasonable, it is too close to White's thickness, a play on the third line is appropriate.];W[hc]C[The strike of W50 deprives of Black's base and is very severe, Black suddenly feels restricted in shape.];B[gc];W[gb];B[hd];W[ib];B[jb]LB[fb:a][eb:b][fc:c][ga:d]C[B55 should first hane at 'a' and see how White to answer. (Luo Xihe: B55 is the losing move. It should first hane at 'a', if White makes the contact play at 'b',  Black can atari at 'd', resulting a ko fight; if White cuts at 'c', then Black can play 55, White needs to reinforce with one more move.)]
;W[ie]C[W56 is a good move. It is time for lunch break.];B[jh];W[je]C[After pondering for a long time, White resolutely pushes through and cut, aiming to kill all black stones at the top, the game becomes white-hot.];B[ke];W[kf];B[jg];W[he]C[The big groups for both sides twist together, it seems Black is in danger.];B[kg]LB[lf:a]C[This move apprears lacking thorough consideration, Black has lost the possibility of throw-in at 'a' to force shortage of liberties on White.];W[lf];B[lh]
;W[mh];B[ki];W[mg];B[fb]C[The hane of B69 now is clearly one-step slow.];W[hb];B[id];W[eb]C[White has responded flawlessly, Black has no way to live. (Luo Xihe: if B71 won't exchange for W72, there is an approach ko for Black.)];B[mi];W[of]C[W74 again is a good move, Black has no follow-up move.];B[fq]C[Black has no choice but to tenuki, all black stones at the top are getting killed and Black has suffered a huge loss.];W[fk]

Black should cut and atari at 'a', followed by W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 'e', W 'f', B 'g', W 'h', B 'i', W 'j', B 'k', a ko fight results, because Black has abundant ko threats in the upper right, the exchange can not be avoided, this way perhaps Black can continue the game.
