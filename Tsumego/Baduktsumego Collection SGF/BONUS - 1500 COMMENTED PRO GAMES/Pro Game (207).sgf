Copyright by gogameworld.com and weiqi.tom.com.]RE[W+R];B[pd]C[Luo Xihe's state is not good recently, hope he can play well in this game.];W[dd];B[qp];W[dq];B[co]
;W[op];B[oq];W[nq];B[pq];W[dl];B[np];W[cp];B[ep];W[dp];B[eo];W[do];B[eq]C[B15 and B17 are Luo Xihe's extreme likings, however the result in the game is not good.];W[dn]LB[en:a][fn:b][em:c]C[W18: The first feeling is W 'a', B 'b' and W 'c'.]
;B[iq]C[Through B19, locally White is relatively satisfied, but Black's configuration at the bottom is also fine.];W[qj];B[qh];W[oj]LB[qm:a][pl:b][ql:c][pj:d]C[The jump of W22 shows Park YuongHoon's big-picture view, the common move is to make extension at 'a', if so, Black has the intense tactic of first striking at 'b', after W 'c', then pressing at 'd'.];B[cf];W[ip];B[jq];W[gp]LB[qf:a][pf:b]C[W24 and W26 aim to serve as ladder breaker, If White directly invades at 'a', Black's press at 'b' is effective.]
;B[gq];W[qf];B[oh]C[The counterattack of B29 is a mindset in the game.];W[of];B[nd];W[mf];B[qe];W[rf];B[pf];W[pg];B[pe];W[qg];B[og]
;W[ph];B[nf]C[Through B41, it forms an exchange, Black can be satisfied.];W[fc];B[bd];W[jd]LB[ch:a][cc:b][ic:c]C[W44 making extension on the side is the first feeling, but in terms of result, White should first clamp at 'a', after B 'b', then White makes two-space extension at 'c'.];B[hc];W[hd];B[id];W[ic]
;B[ie];W[hb];B[jc];W[ib];B[he];W[kc];B[je];W[kd];B[ci]C[After Black makes extension with B57, in terms of the whole game, Black is relatively vivid, the joseki that White elects to play in the lower-left corner appears slow.];W[df];B[dg];W[ce];B[bf]
;W[eg];B[ef]LB[dh:a]C[B63: For Black to simply retreat at 'a' is better, paying more attention to the whole game.];W[de];B[cc];W[ff];B[re]C[B67 blocking the corner is very big.];W[oi];B[mg]C[B67 forces White to make the very damaging exchange of W68 and B69, so far Black succeeds in the opening.];W[lg];B[lf];W[kf]
;B[me];W[ke];B[sf];W[sg];B[se];W[rh];B[lb];W[dh];B[cg];W[ei];B[ck]LB[mp:a]C[B83 is small, Black should extend at 'a'.];W[lp]
;B[no];W[jp]C[W84 and W86 are vital points, Black instantly doesn't have any good answer.];B[ih]C[Through B87, the situation is not clear.];W[kq];B[hp];W[ho];B[hq];W[gn];B[kh];W[er];B[fr];W[ds]C[W94 and W96 are strong moves, locally it is ko-alive, perhaps Luo Xihe overlooks this tactic.]
;B[kr]C[At the top Black still has defects, for the whole game, Black is relatively difficult.];W[lr];B[ks];W[kg]LB[nr:a]C[W100: White should descend at 'a', it is a huge move, making the ko-killing at the bottom more severe, and also making Black's lower-right corner thinner.];B[fm];W[gm];B[fo];W[kj];B[go]C[B103 and B105 are very big, Black makes life in sente, but the situation is still to White's advantage. In terms of territory, Black is fine, but Black in the middle is very dangerous.];W[in];B[fg]
;W[ee];B[fh];W[gf];B[fi];W[ej];B[eh];W[di];B[fj];W[ek];B[cj];W[fk];B[ef];W[hh]
;B[hi];W[hg];B[eg]C[Black connects the ko with B123 and temporally steps over a difficult situation.];W[nr]TR[dh]C[Looking back, the atari of W80 (the marked stone) has a huge impact on the whole game.];B[ko];W[kp];B[mq];W[mr];B[ig];W[if];B[ii]
;W[jf]C[Through W132, the game enters into Park YuongHoon good-at situation.

After this move, it is time for lunch break.];B[rn]C[B133 shows Luo Xihe's talent, to make one or two space extension is all going to be exploited.];W[cl];B[eb];W[db];B[dc];W[ec];B[fb];W[gb];B[or];W[bk];B[bj]
;W[kb];B[mc];W[fa];B[cb];W[ea]C[Through W148, White takes two stones, the game is close.];B[ql];W[pm];B[on];W[mn];B[om];W[pl];B[qm];W[be]
;B[ae];W[ca]LB[bl:a]C[W158: The normal move is to connect at 'a', this way this situation is very close.];B[bl];W[bm];B[ak];W[bb];B[am];W[an];B[bn]C[B165: If Black elects to connect the ko, Black will incur half-point loss, this way the game is very close, Luo Xihe should still have chance.];W[al];B[pi]
;W[qi];B[am];W[pn];B[cm];W[po]C[Through W172, Black clearly incurs loss in the exchange, Luo Xihe has miscalculated.];B[gl];W[cn];B[jk];W[bo];B[ao];W[ap];B[mm];W[lm]
;B[ol];W[ok];B[ml];W[ll];B[mj]C[Through B185, even if Black can connect, in terms of territory, Black incurs loss comparing with not fighting the ko.];W[mi];B[ln];W[lo];B[lj];W[pp];B[qo];W[kk];B[li]
;W[os];B[qr];W[jl];B[il];W[im];B[jm];W[kl];B[kn];W[mo];B[jj];W[hl];B[ik];W[jn]C[Through W206, White captures four stones, Black is leading about 4 points on the board, the difference is obvious, Black loses for sure.]
;B[ki];W[km]C[Overall, Black's opening is smooth, but Black is too fierce to grab territory in the middle game, as a result White takes control of the situation, Black sinks into a bitter battle. In the second half, Luo Xihe makes life both in the middle and at the bottom by taking advantage of Park YuongHoon's slow moves, the situation becomes close. At the crucial moment, Luo Xihe releases the losing move of initiating the ko and clearly incurs loss in the exchange. In the endgame, Luo Xihe basically doesn't have a chance.];B[bc];W[qs]C[B165 is a mistake by wrong judgement and it is the key for the game.];B[rs];W[ps];B[rr];W[rk];B[rl];W[qk];B[hk];W[dm]
