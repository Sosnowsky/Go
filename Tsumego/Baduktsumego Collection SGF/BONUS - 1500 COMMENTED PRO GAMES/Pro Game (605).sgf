;W[qj];B[ql];W[qf];B[mc];W[qc]LB[rd:a]C[W10: White can also make knight at 'a'.];B[qd];W[pc];B[od];W[oc];B[rd];W[nc];B[nd]
;W[mb];B[lc];W[lb];B[kc];W[kb];B[qh]LB[of:a][oh:b]C[After the invasion of B23, for White to jump at 'a' is also playable. In the past with B23 for Black to hang at 'b' is also possible.];W[ph];B[qg];W[pg];B[rf]C[In the game, Black can only cross over inconveniently with B25 and B27.]
;W[oj]C[Through W28, it seems White's situation is not bad.];B[ol];W[lj]LB[mj:a]C[But the two-space jump of W30 is overplay, to jump at 'a' is the original move.];B[oi]C[The attachment of B31 is sharp! Up to the cut of B43, it seems Lee Changho's style is changing, more active and intense.];W[pi];B[nj];W[ni];B[mi];W[nk];B[nh];W[ok]
;B[nl];W[ml];B[pk];W[pj];B[mk]LB[mm:a]C[In fact, with B43, for Black to play hane at 'a' is already enough.];W[mj];B[lk];W[ni];B[dp];W[mm];B[kk];W[li]
;B[eq];W[cq];B[cp]TR[ml][mm]LB[ep:a][bo:b][km:c]C[As to B53, Black elects to take the corner, I can't understand. Now W40 and W48 (the marked stones) are still very weak, I feel, Black should connect at 'a', next W 'b' and B 'c', this variation is more consistent with the earlier positive moves.];W[er];B[fr];W[fq];B[ep];W[gr]
;B[dr];W[fs]C[White takes one stone, the role of thickness and thinness is switched.];B[cr];W[fp];B[nn];W[qq];B[pq];W[km];B[cj];W[eo];B[bo];W[ek];B[il]
;W[mn];B[in];W[hm];B[im];W[jk];B[jl];W[jj];B[kl]LB[kj:a][ki:b]C[Before connecting with B79, Black should first push at 'a' to exchange with W 'b'. Later on if Black pushes at 'a', White may not block at 'b'.];W[no];B[jp]C[From B81 to B87, it forms an exchange.]
;W[kp];B[fo];W[jo];B[go];W[ip];B[po];W[bq]C[After this exchange, Black also handles well his lonely group in the center.];B[br];W[di];B[kj];W[ci]C[White plays W90 and W92 consecutively, very big.];B[cc]
;W[cd];B[dc];W[ec];B[eb];W[fb];B[fc];W[ed];B[gb];W[db];B[fa];W[cb]C[Through W104, it is a close game.];B[bf];W[be]
;B[bi]C[B105 and B107 are good moves.];W[dj];B[ck];W[bh]LB[bj:a]C[Since B 'a' is still sente, Black takes a lot of advantage.];B[jq];W[kq];B[ki];W[mh];B[iq]LB[jr:a][io:b][kr:c]C[Black's sequence following B115 is not good. Black should descend at 'a', next W 'b' and B 'c', crossing over.  This way Black's territory is not bad.]

;W[ob];B[hd];W[ip]LB[em:a]C[W144: For White to extend at 'a' is bigger.];B[em];W[fm];B[en];W[dk];B[cl];W[gd];B[hh];W[hj];B[gg]

;W[da];B[ea];W[gk];B[na];W[nb];B[ab];W[bd];B[ac];W[ga];B[ha];W[je]C[However, when Black forces with B173, White takes tenuki with W176. White is very brave, the corner is 22 points, White's situation is not bad, it seems White shouldn't take this risk.];B[gj];W[gi]
;B[fj]TR[hh][gg]LB[ba:a]C[B179: Black misses a good chance! Black should capture at 'a', White is already not easy to capture B151 and B153 (the marked two stones), this way Black still have chance.];W[hi];B[fi];W[ih];B[fk];W[fh];B[gl];W[ad];B[eh]LB[gh:a][ii:b]C[B187 is the last losing move! Black should cut at 'a', next W 'b' and B187, capturing W184 in the ladder. If White dares escape W184, it will form a ko fight, which is very heavy for White, this way the outcome of the game is still difficult to say.]
;W[gh]C[After White connects with W188, Black is too thin on the board. Black will be inevitably exploited.];B[ei];W[rl];B[rk];W[qk];B[rm];W[pl];B[qm];W[rj];B[le];W[pf];B[kd];W[fl]
