(;SZ[19]EV[Korea 33rd Myungin Title final game 3]DT[2002-09-24]KM[6.5]PB[Lee Changho]BR[9p]PW[An Choyong]WR[7p]PC[Korea]RE[W+0.5]C[Commentary: Wang Lei 8p, Copyright by gogameworld.com and weiqi.tom.com];B[pd]C[I believe this is a game An Choyong will never forget in his career, this is the first victory after 10 losses in a row to World #1 Lee Changho. It also marked he finally conquered huge psychologic obstacles and begin to mature as a top go player.];W[dd];B[pq];W[dq]
;B[qo];W[kq];B[do];W[co];B[cn];W[cp];B[dn];W[dj]C[W12 is a novel play, centainly you can not say this is a good move, but even after 10 successive losses, An has the courage to try some new moves and this shows he still can settle himself down and be relaxed to play this game.];B[eq];W[er];B[dp];W[cq];B[fq]
;W[fr];B[hq];W[nq];B[lp]C[B21 is not urgent.];W[lq];B[np];W[oq];B[op];W[pr];B[qr];W[qi]C[W28 tenuki, it's smart choice ! White can't afford Black to play here.];B[or]
;W[mp];B[mo];W[mq];B[nn];W[lo];B[ln];W[ko];B[kn];W[jo];B[fc];W[cf];B[qk]C[Black first played 39 then 41, hard to understand.];W[qf]
;B[qe];W[pf];B[nc];W[pp];B[qq];W[hc]C[W48 attacks Black first, White is active.];B[db];W[fd]LB[cc:a]C[W50 is a thick but rather slow move, it's better to be played at 'a'.];B[ec];W[ed];B[cc]
;W[cd];B[rf];W[rg];B[re];W[fo]C[W58 is urgent ! Black is difficult.];B[ho];W[fm];B[fp];W[dl];B[em];W[fl]C[Through 64, White has gained a little.];B[gr]
;W[on]C[W66 is a good move ! it made several good forcing moves to take advantage of Black's shortage for liberties.];B[om];W[pk];B[pl];W[nm];B[oo];W[pn];B[po];W[ok];B[qj];W[pj];B[ri];W[ql]
;B[rl];W[mm];B[mn];W[qh]TR[nm]C[Through W82, White again gains a little. Among them, the marked stone is the most outstanding play.];B[qn];W[ld];B[me];W[lg]C[W84 and W86 are so liberal and broad ! An Choyong can really relax and go all out !];B[kk]C[B87 is stable and safe. Even though White seems gaining here and there, Black doesn't fall behind, this is where Lee is strong (to make him world #1).];W[le];B[jr]C[B89 is slow ! it's small if compared with W90, now Black should step into the center.];W[ik];B[ki];W[jj];B[kj];W[jm];B[ll];W[jh]C[W96 sealed the center completely, White is leading now.];B[oi];W[nh]C[W98 is important ! with this move White's big dragon is safe.];B[ni];W[pi];B[gc]
;W[dc]LB[hd:a]C[W102 is not necessary, it's much better to retreat at 'a'. In the game, White suffered some loss locally.];B[hb];W[cb];B[ca]LB[gd:a]C[B105 is his own wishful thinking, if it was played at 'a', White's shape will deteriorate.];W[hd]C[W106 turns around and makes the right choice, it's just a small loss.];B[bb];W[ib];B[bd];W[be]
;B[fs];W[ds];B[bn];W[bo];B[ck];W[dk];B[bj];W[cj];B[mh]LB[il:a]C[B119 is the losing move ! If B119 was at 'a', Black still have a little advantage.];W[nf]C[W120 jumping is beautiful ! Black didn't gain anything and only showed his weak point.];B[il]C[B121 cuts across, it's a good play.]
;W[hk]C[W122 keeps calm and cool-headed, because the lower side is not completely alive yet, White can't afford to make any strong move.];B[kr];W[nr];B[ps];W[lr];B[bi];W[cl];B[ak];W[go];B[gp];W[bk];B[am];W[nb]C[W134 holds under and it's the winning move !]
;B[mb]C[B135 and the following moves are inevitable, White gained a little by reducing liberties but just enough to turn the game.];W[ob];B[md];W[lc];B[mc];W[rc];B[qb];W[oc];B[od];W[qc];B[pc];W[pb];B[rb]

;W[jg];B[jn];W[jq];B[iq];W[ns];B[ji];W[ii];B[gb];W[ad];B[bc];W[jl]LB[im:a]C[W184 is not good, better if played at 'a'.];B[jk]
;W[hm];B[ij];W[hj];B[kg];W[kf];B[bg];W[bh];B[ah];W[af]C[The diagonal move at W194 is a clever play ! otherwise it won't have chance later.];B[ag];W[cg];B[ao];W[ap]
;B[an];W[br];B[jb]C[B201 is the last challenging move.];W[la];B[nd];W[ic]LB[ia:a]C[W204 is calm and safe, playing at 'a' is a little better but too complicated and easy to make errors. An Choyong used to win by half point, his endgame skill is very powerful, now he is already clear that he will win by at least half point.];B[ia];W[ja];B[ka];W[jc];B[ih]
