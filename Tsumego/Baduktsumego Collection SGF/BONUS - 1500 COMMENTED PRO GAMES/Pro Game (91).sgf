Copyright by gogameworld.com and weiqi.tom.com.];B[qd];W[dc];B[de]C[The high approach of B3 is Cho U's unique opening. Only if White takes the small point with W2, he will approach right away. As to this, Yu Bin must have studied his counter strategy.];W[pp];B[cc]
;W[cp]C[W6: White more often will play at the star point in the past.];B[ep]C[B7: Black again plays the high approach, Cho U's opening is very active.];W[eq];B[fq];W[dq];B[oc];W[cb];B[cd];W[gc]LB[jp:a]C[W12: White can consider to pincer at 'a' on the lower side, if Black makes an extension on the left side, then White plays W12 and W14.];B[bb];W[jc]
;B[nq];W[qn];B[pr];W[fp]C[W20: White normally will make the diagonal at 3-3, then Black makes the two-space extension. It is hard to understand why Yu Bin reserves this exchange.];B[qq];W[qk];B[cj];W[gq]C[The atari of W24 is huge, White can't allow Black to play here.];B[qi];W[qp]C[In terms of opening, this game will be a long one.];B[pm]LB[rl:a]C[B27 is an asking move, for White to make the diagonal at 'a' is common.]
;W[qm]C[Before this game, Yu Bin often says Cho U's fighting power is strong, now the game forms the current situation, obviously he has well prepared.];B[kc]LB[lc:a][db:b][cm:c]C[For Black to make the two-space extension at 'a', next W 'b' and B 'c', is the first feeling. B29 is a surprising move.];W[kd];B[lc];W[jd]C[W30 and W32 are thick moves, this exchange is not to Black's advantage.];B[cm];W[db];B[kq]LB[dg:a]C[B35 is a big move, but what to do if White invades at 'a'? White at the top is too thick.]
;W[dg];B[gd]LB[fc:a]C[B37: Black borrows strength, it is good feeling, White is a little painful. White perhaps will tolerate at 'a'.];W[hc]LB[bg:a]C[Black takes some advantage, then flies over at 'a', Black feels a little better.];B[fg];W[di];B[bh]C[Cho U's play is very romantic.];W[cf];B[fe]C[B43 is shape.];W[dl]LB[dj:a][fh:b]C[W44 is good order, if Black counterattacks at 'a', White can attach at 'b'.]
;B[fi]LB[dj:a][ck:b][fj:c][gj:d][gi:e]C[Cho U's consciousness of resistance is very strong. If White presses at 'a' with W46, B 'b', W 'c', B 'd' and W 'e', this is the first feeling.];W[bi]LB[ef:a]C[W46 is a good tesuji! White's purpose is: leaving the diagonal cut at 'a', Black will strengthen immediately, White himself also obtains eye shape.];B[ci];W[ch]C[After this move, it is time for lunch break.];B[bj];W[bg]
;B[ai]C[Black has no choice but to play the sequence from B47 to B51.];W[dj];B[fc];W[fb];B[fk];W[ef]C[W56: White starts to pound at Black.];B[ee];W[ff];B[gf];W[gg];B[hf];W[fh]
;B[gh];W[eg];B[hg]LB[hh:a]C[B65 is strong and unyielding, if Black extends at 'a', White is already alive and White can be satisfied.];W[gi];B[fg];W[eh];B[hi];W[gj];B[fj]C[B71: Black can't sacrifice stones, otherwise White's left side will be exploited in the future.];W[hj]C[W72: White turns out, Black is a little painful in this fight.];B[ij]
;W[ii];B[hh];W[gl];B[fl];W[ck]LB[cl:a][bl:b][dm:c]C[W78: White can consider to push at 'a', next B 'b' and W 'c'.];B[bk];W[hl]C[Yu Bin's situation is optimistic.

After this move, it is time for lunch break.

Black has used 1 hour and 30 minutes,
White used 1 hour and 30 minutes.];B[dm];W[em]
;B[fm];W[en];B[fn];W[be]LB[el:a]C[White makes life with W86, it is better than the connection at 'a'.];B[cl];W[ji]LB[hn:a]TR[ij]C[W88 is light and nimble, reserving the sente move at 'a', temporarily Black can't pull out the marked stone (B73), so B87 is a careless move, Black should jump to 'a' instead.];B[dk];W[bd]C[The crawl of W90 is big, ruining eye shape. White has to escape with dame moves. White is clearly favorable.]
;B[kg];W[jk]LB[li:a]C[W92 is steady, Yu Bin obviously thinks he is favorable, the common move is to jump at 'a'.];B[lh];W[rd]C[W94 is a common tactic.];B[qc]C[Black is falling behind, so with B95 Black doesn't want to give an inch, it is understandable.];W[qg]C[White invades with W96, this is the last fight. If White lives easily, Black can only concede defeat.];B[oi];W[qe];B[rf];W[rg]
;B[qf];W[pf];B[re];W[ri]LB[pe:a][rc:b][pg:c][qh:d][ph:e][sf:f][sd:g][ld:h]C[W104: For White to connect at 'a' is a little better, next B 'b', W104, B 'c', W 'd', B 'e', W 'f', B 'g' and W 'h'.];B[pe]C[B105: Black takes one stone and becomes very thick.]
;W[pq];B[rr];W[rq];B[qr];W[qj]C[Through W110, the local variation comes to an end, Black takes a small profit, the situation is still to White's advantage.];B[lj];W[ki];B[li];W[hn];B[iq];W[ld];B[hd]LB[jg:a]C[B117: Black should worry White's attachment at 'a', this is the purpose of W112.]
;W[ec];B[km];W[jm];B[jn]LB[kl:a]C[Not sure what the purpose of B121 is, after White hangs at 'a', Black can't move.];W[kl];B[lm];W[in];B[im];W[jl];B[fr]LB[gn:a]C[B127 is an early planned move, since B 'a' is kind of sente.]
;W[jg];B[jf];W[kf]C[W128 and W130 are good move, Black is difficult to handle.];B[jh];W[kh];B[ig];W[lg];B[lf]LB[jg:a]C[B135: if Black connects at 'a', even Black can make life, but it almost equals to conceding defeat.];W[jg];B[gk]C[B137 is the only ko threat on the board, it is all fine whether White answers the ko threat or not.];W[hk]
;B[kg];W[mc];B[mg];W[nb]C[W140 and W142: White gains a big profit.];B[gr];W[gp];B[er];W[dr];B[eo];W[bn]C[The sequence from B143 to W148 is almost inevitable.];B[jo];W[oq]
;B[or];W[np];B[mp];W[no]C[After White extends with W154, White will win the game by a small margin.];B[ho];W[io];B[ip];W[gn];B[go];W[mq]LB[bc:a]C[W160: For White to cut at 'a' is bigger.];B[nr]
;W[lp]C[W162 should be reserved, here Black is not easy to handle.];B[mo];W[mn];B[lo];W[mm];B[ko];W[ol]C[The sequence from W162 to W168 is not good, White first incurs two-point loss, then encloses territory, it is too small!];B[ds]C[B169 is 6 points in counter-sente.];W[cs];B[es];W[br];B[fo]
;W[bc];B[nl];W[nm];B[md];W[pg]C[W178 is a thick play.];B[ob];W[mb];B[na];W[sg];B[sf];W[rp];B[cn];W[bm]
;B[co]C[Yu Bin plays very brilliantly today.];W[bo];B[dp];W[bp];B[qh];W[rh];B[oh];W[nj];B[oj];W[ok];B[ml];W[nk];B[id]
