Translation:GoGameWorld.];B[qd]C[In the 38th Korean Wangwi league game held on 4/5, Yoo Changhyeok lost to Kim Juho by half point, now he already lost three consecutive games in the league, whether he can stay in the league becomes a big problem. In the following four games, he has to win all games in order to stay in the league. Yoo Changhyeok is not in a good state recently, it is understandable, however following Maxim Cup, he again lost by half point, he was indeed a little unlucky.];W[dd];B[pq];W[oc];B[md]C[The opening from B1 to B5 is very popular recently, in the recent LG Cup final, we already saw this opening several times.]
;W[qk]C[As to this opening, W6 seeks variation, it is a normal playing psychology.];B[od];W[qo];B[np];W[dq]C[W10: White gets to take the empty corner first, it can be said that White walks out of the circle of fierce fights.];B[qi];W[lq]LB[ok:a]C[Next with W12, for White to reinforce at 'a' would be steady.];B[qm]C[The invasion of B13 is inevitable.];W[rm]C[W14: White probably can only play like this, to initiate a direct confrontation seems unreasonable.];B[rl]C[With the sequence following B15, Black takes territory.]
;W[ql];B[rn];W[pm];B[qn];W[pn];B[ro]LB[po:a][so:b][rk:c]C[B21: It is worth mentioning that for Black to cut at 'a' instead is no better than the play in the game, followed by White's sente atari at 21, then W 'b' and White's sente turn at 'c'.];W[mo];B[po];W[oo];B[pp]
;W[no]C[Through W26, the local variation comes to an end, forming a position of Black's territory vs. White's outside influence.
];B[dn];W[cp]LB[eo:a]C[As for the two-space high approach of B27, the diagonal of W28 in a low position is clearly questionable, now White certainly shouldn't play in a low position. White can consider to make the knight's move at 'a', it would be easier for White to enclose territory later on.];B[dk];W[ci];B[ei];W[cf];B[fo]C[B33: Black presses in sente.];W[fq]C[The play of W34 clearly contradicts with the earlier strategy of taking influence.];B[gl]LB[ej:a][nc:b][ho:c]C[B35: Black seeks safety, now Black shouldn't worry that his several stones would come under attack, as to the crosscut of W 'a', Black can handle B31 lightly, with B35 hanging at 'b' is huge. Even if Black wants to reinforce, Black should jump to 'c', this way containing White's potential of forming territory at the top and also expanding his development in the center, Black should play this way.]
;W[pc]C[After White pulls out with W36, it is hard to say that Black is favorable for the game.];B[pd];W[mc];B[nc];W[nb];B[nd];W[lb];B[lc];W[mb];B[kc];W[qc];B[nm]LB[oj:a]C[B47 seems unreasonable, Black's normal play is making the knight's move at 'a'.]
;W[ok]C[White jumps out with W48, affecting Black to form a territory at the top.];B[ml];W[hp]C[Next White takes the chance to take territory with W50, Black's situation suddenly becomes severe!];B[pj];W[oj];B[on]C[Black attacks by cutting at 53, but it seems far-fetched.];W[ph];B[rk];W[om];B[nn];W[mj];B[kl]
;W[mg]C[W60: White eliminates Black's potential.];B[jp]C[With the sequence following B61, Black can only capture three white stones in gote, Black suffers a big loss.];W[jq];B[lp];W[kp];B[ko];W[kq];B[lo];W[qh]LB[ec:a]C[Next White starts to become conservative. First with W68, White can reinforce the corner at 'a', in the game Black's attachment to the corner is the last big point.];B[lf];W[lg]
;B[kg];W[kh];B[jh];W[ki];B[dc];W[ec]LB[cc:a]C[W76: White should consider to protect the corner by playing the hane at 'a'.];B[cd];W[de];B[cb];W[eb];B[be];W[bf]
;B[bc];W[ic];B[mf];W[ie];B[ng];W[nh];B[ji];W[og];B[jf];W[jo]C[The ensuing W86, W92 and W128 are all questionable moves!];B[jn];W[io];B[mq]
