;B[po];W[jp]C[To handle Black's "Chinese Fuseki", W6 and W8 are trend, normally W4 will be more at the star point.];B[cn];W[do]C[The sequence following W10 puts emphasis on outside thickness.];B[bp];W[dn];B[cm];W[dk];B[dm];W[em];B[bk];W[bj]C[After White attaches strongly with W18, it immediately leads to a fierce fight.]
;B[ck]C[The sequence from B19 to B39 is almost an inevitable variation.];W[cj];B[dj];W[ek];B[ci];W[bi];B[ch];W[di];B[ej];W[dh];B[fk];W[fj];B[ei]
;W[fl];B[bh];W[dg];B[fi];W[gk];B[gi];W[bg];B[aj];W[mm]C[W40: White can consider to take tenuki and grab big points.];B[dr];W[cr]C[As to the attachment of B41, with W42 White has no assurance of success. The original move is to hane at 'a'. In the real game, through B63, Black makes life one group, White still needs to push with W64 and ends in gote, overall Black is favorable.]LB[er:a]

;W[co];B[hq];W[hn];B[in];W[jo];B[gn];W[hm];B[gp];W[bo];B[jc]C[B65: For Black to make diagonal at 'a' instead is very big.]LB[pl:a];W[qm];B[ro]C[However, when White invades with W66, the play of B67 seems to have been taken advantage, from state of mind, Black wants to strengthen with the knight's move at 'a'.]LB[qf:a]
;W[qf];B[re]C[From B69 to B77, Black can be satisfied.];W[nd];B[of];W[pc]C[W72: White should consider to make two-space extension at 'a'.]LB[qi:a];B[qc];W[oc];B[qb];W[lc];B[pi];W[qd]
;B[qe];W[pe];B[rd];W[oe]LB[fc:a]C[W82: White should make the knight's move at 'a', this is huge!];B[pf];W[nf];B[ng];W[mf];B[eb];W[dc];B[gc]C[White's sequence from W78 to W86 is slow, Black comes back to grab big points with B87 and B89, Black is favorable.]
;W[or];B[oq];W[nq];B[pr]C[The order of B91 and B93 is hard to understand, Black certainly should simply block at 93! ?The pierce at 92 should be reserved.];W[pj]C[The attachment of W94 is tesuji, it is also White's start towards victory.];B[oj];W[ph];B[oh];W[qi];B[oi];W[qj];B[pk]
;W[qg];B[og];W[rk];B[rl];W[sj];B[ol];W[rh];B[rf];W[rg]C[With B95 Black probably should tolerate at 98, from W96 to W110 White makes life, Black incurs heavy loss!];B[nn];W[rm];B[ql];W[sl]C[Through W114, Black's big territory is all being destroyed, the situation has already been turned around, but the difference is not big, the outcome of the game is still hard to imagine.]
;B[mn];W[ln];B[db];W[cb];B[bb];W[cg];B[ai];W[cc];B[ca];W[bc];B[lo]LB[kb:a][hc:b]C[B125 is the last losing move, for Black to make diagonal at 'a' is very big, and also it guards against White's attachment at 'b'. In the real game, White attaches in at 'b', through B137, White takes advantage in sente, Black is very painful.

;B[ko];W[kn];B[lq];W[ij];B[ii];W[ji];B[hj];W[ih]C[B145 is hasty, at any rate Black can only retreat at 146. In the game, it forms a ko, White is light and Black is heavy, as a result Black's several stones on the right side are captured, White wins the game for sure.];B[hk];W[gm];B[ik];W[hi];B[gj]
