Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[Today I will introduce one quarter-final game in the 10th LG Refined Oil Cup between Lee Changho 9p and An DalHoon 6p. Recently Lee Changho 9p's record is extremely well, before this game, he already achieves 10 consecutive victories.];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[fc]
;W[hc];B[oc];W[po];B[pm];W[no];B[nq];W[qq];B[qr];W[qk]LB[qp:a][or:b][qm:c][ql:d][pl:e]C[White elects to low-pincer with W14, it easily leads to a fight, if White retreats at 'a', next B 'b', W 'c', B 'd' and W 'e', this is a popular variation.]
;B[rm]LB[ol:a][qp:b]C[B15 is the most severe answer as to W14. If Black makes the diagonal at 'a', it seems slow, after White retreats at 'b' in sente, White can cross over at 15.];W[pp];B[or];W[ol]C[The bump of W16 and the knight's move of W18 are also locally the strongest moves.];B[om];W[nm];B[nl]C[Black cuts resolutely with B19 and B21, not willing to fall behind, it seems both sides decide to fight and win the game in the lower-right corner. But perhaps White has miscalculated. In terms of result, in this fight affecting the whole game, Lee Changho's calculation is much more accurate than An DalHoon's.];W[ok];B[nn];W[mm]
;B[mn]LB[on:a][oo:b]C[Black pushes out with B25, it is strong and unyielding! If Black  connects at 'a', next W25 and B 'b', this way Black is also playable, but White gets to drop burden and takes a breather.];W[on];B[lm];W[ml];B[ro]C[After Black takes the vital point with B29, White sinks into a bitter fight.];W[mp];B[lo];W[rp];B[rq];W[qo]

;W[qn];B[ql]C[The hit of B49 is strong and Black's most shining move in this game, White unexpectedly can do nothing about it, probably early on White overlooks this move.];W[rk]LB[pl:a][qm:b][sm:c][sn:d]C[W50: if White squeezes at 'a', next B 'b' and W 'c', Black can throw in at 'd' to initiate a ko fight, White is not favorable in ko threats.];B[dc]C[The play of B51 is related to ladder breaker.];W[kn];B[ko];W[cc];B[mo]
;W[np];B[pk]LB[pl:a][nk:b][mk:c]C[B51 and B57 are related clever moves, this way if White plays atari at 'a', Black can play atari at 'b' in sente, then capture White's three stones at 'a' in a ladder.];W[rl];B[mk];W[nk];B[ll]C[B59 and B61 are very happy wrap-up.];W[nl];B[pj];W[oi]LB[pl:a]C[W64: White can only capture Black's several key stones at 'a', even if Black becomes thick by sacrificing, Black's advantage is already obvious.]
;B[pl]C[After Black connects out dead stones with B65, White's situation has deteriorated.];W[pi];B[qj];W[qi];B[rj];W[qm];B[rh]C[After Black jumps over with B71, the game for White is as good as lost.];W[ri];B[si];W[oj];B[qg];W[pg]
