;B[id]LB[gd:a][ie:b][ge:c]C[B29: In the past, Black always play the double hane at 'a', if White hangs at 'b', then Black will extend at 'c'.];W[ie]C[The atari of W30 is not good, making White heavy, although they seem to tangle together and the situation is not clear, but in fact White is a little difficult.];B[jd];W[kd];B[je];W[ke];B[jf];W[kf];B[gd]
;W[he];B[jg];W[kg];B[ge];W[ph]LB[hf:a][gf:b][hg:c][jh:d][qi:e]C[W42: If White directly turns at 'a', then B 'b', W 'c' and B 'd', White's two groups are all very heavy and White very likely can't play somewhere else, if Black gets to extend at 'e', White would totally fail.];B[ng]LB[nh:a][nf:b]C[B43 is common, if Black jumps to 'a', White will counterattack by cutting at 'b'.]
;W[nh];B[mh];W[mg];B[mi]LB[jh:a][hf:b][ni:c]C[The extension of B47 is a good move! Making White difficult. If White hanes at 'a' to exchange for B 'b', although White can attach at 'c', Black also can't stick his head out, but because Black already takes a big profit by the exchange of W 'a and B 'b', Black can be satisfied by only making life.];W[kh];B[jh];W[ji];B[nf];W[ni];B[lg]LB[mj:a][kj:b]C[B53: For Black to exchange B 'a' and W 'b' then play B53 is better.]

If Black takes at 'j' with B 'f', then White can make a big profit by playing at 'f', this would be still a balanced game (see var a).];B[fe];W[ff];B[ee]
;W[gi]LB[gh:a]C[W68 and W72 are miscalculation, White didn't expect Black's simple push at 'a' is a good move!];B[gh];W[ef]LB[lk:a]C[W74: In the game  for White to hane at 'a' instead is already too late. Black will tenuki to turn at 74, White is too heavy!];B[fi];W[de];B[ed];W[gj];B[eh];W[ec];B[gb]
