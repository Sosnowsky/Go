Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[This is one of the 1st Chang-ki Cup semi final games between Chang Hao 9p and Kong Jie 7p, it is also the first Chang Hao's official match after he lost in Toyota Cup World Oza, however since Chang-ki Cup has the highest champion prize money of 400,000 Chinese Yuan, it draws a very broad attention.];W[dc];B[pp];W[dq];B[ce]
;W[dh];B[ed];W[ec]LB[dd:a]C[The crawl of W8 is a rare move after the two-space high pincer of W6, the common play is to push at 'a'.];B[fd];W[gc];B[cc];W[gd];B[dd]LB[di:a]C[In the set pattern up to B13, the position of W6 is no good (no better than 'a'), White is a little dissatisfied.];W[od];B[fc]
;W[fb];B[mc]LB[oc:a][gf:b]C[The counter-pincer of B17 aims to destroy White's plan, if Black attaches at 'a', after White hanes and connects, White can jump at 'a', White's configuration is vivid and splendid, and it is White's ideal shape.];W[ob];B[qg];W[ne]LB[kc:a]C[The diagonal extension of W20 is worth study, when B19 is in a low position, it is still easier for White to control if White pincers at 'a'.];B[kd];W[kf]C[W20 and W22 look like great attacking momentum, however they are damaging to territory, the risk is big.];B[id];W[hb]
;B[if]C[B25: Black manages to stick his head out, Black's shape is not that right, but how White to attack is a difficult problem.];W[cb];B[bb];W[jc]C[White elects to attack with the knight's move of W28, it is hard to say whether this is good or bad.];B[ic];W[ib];B[lf]C[B31: Black attaches out, it is good-timing.];W[pg];B[qh];W[kg]C[The retreat of W34 is calm, locally it is a good move, however the exchange of W32 and B33 is also very damaging.];B[kc]
;W[le];B[db]C[B37 taking one stone is very big.];W[eb];B[ca];W[jb];B[ke];W[lg];B[he]C[B43 is a thoughtful move, now Black must pay some price.];W[ge];B[gf];W[fe];B[fh]
;W[df];B[bg]C[However, overall, though B49, Black obtains a lot of territory, Black's situation is not bad.];W[dj];B[gj];W[qf];B[rf];W[pf];B[qe];W[ff];B[gg];W[ig]C[White's attack with W56 and W58 is tasteless. With W56 White can consider to clamp at 57, here White has to find some good ways to attack.];B[jq]
;W[fj]C[W60: White starts to exert power, this local fight is very crucial.];B[ei]C[The counterattack following W61 is very interesting, the sequence from both sides is inevitable.];W[ej];B[di];W[ci];B[ch];W[cg];B[bh];W[cj];B[hh];W[gi];B[hi]
;W[gk];B[hj];W[fi];B[eh];W[dg];B[jh];W[jg];B[gh];W[bf];B[cf];W[ee];B[eg];W[be]
;B[bd];W[bi];B[ae];W[kb];B[lb];W[ld];B[lc];W[ea];B[ph];W[li];B[il]C[Through B95, Black is favorable.];W[ep];B[gm]
;W[em];B[co]C[B99 is an asking move.];W[de];B[cd];W[do]C[White's play following W102 is very tenacious, it seems White also notices his situation is not so good.];B[fo];W[eo];B[cm];W[dm];B[pc];W[oc];B[lk]C[B109 is the vital point, Black takes control of the game.]

;B[of];W[nf];B[gq];W[mn];B[pm];W[po];B[op];W[rl];B[cr]C[B131 is a good move, this is also Black's privilege.];W[bp];B[bq];W[cp];B[er]
;W[dr];B[ds]C[After Black crosses over with B137, Black's leading in territory becomes obvious.];W[im]C[After W138, White releases several game-deciding moves, Black calmly answers all of them, not tangling with White, it is a winning attitude.];B[hl];W[hq];B[gr];W[ho];B[go];W[hn];B[fm];W[jl];B[ap]
;W[ao];B[aq];W[cn];B[jk];W[kq]LB[kp:a]C[W152 again is a game-deciding move, however it is a little unreasonable. White should make the shoulder-hit at 'a', this way the game can enter into endgame, however because of the special Ing rules and also we heard now Black already incurred 4 point penalty, this way the endgame is worth playing.];B[kp]C[B151: Kong Jie counterattacks, his calculation is very accurate, Black defeated White by favorable ko threats at one stroke.];W[jp];B[lq];W[kr];B[jr];W[lp]
