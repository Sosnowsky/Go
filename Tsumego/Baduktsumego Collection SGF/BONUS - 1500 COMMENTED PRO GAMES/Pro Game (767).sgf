;B[nm]LB[qj:a][cn:b]C[B19 is a surprising move, the common move is to make extension at 'a' or double-approach the corner at 'b'.];W[lo]LB[ln:a][np:b][mp:c][mo:d]C[The press of W20 is inevitable, if White jumps to 'a', then Black will cut at 'b', next W 'c' and B 'd', White is not good.];B[dn]C[B21: Black takes tenuki and counter-pincers with B21, it is very novel.];W[fp];B[gp];W[fo]

;W[nb];B[me]C[From B31 to B37, Black elects to take outside thickness.];W[fc]C[W38 is the last big point, this situation most likely will lead to a moyo race.];B[bn]C[B39: Black seeks a chance to fight here.];W[cq];B[br];W[dl]C[W42: If White blocks crossover, White has no assurance of success.];B[bp]C[B43: Black connects back and watch how White is going to act.];W[ce]C[W44: White grabs territory desperately, now let's see how Black to attack in the lower left corner.];B[em]
;W[go];B[hp];W[gm];B[gk]LB[fl:a]C[B49 is a not-easy-to-find good move, if White connects back at 'a', White feels very wronged.];W[ko]C[W50 is kind of sente.];B[jq];W[ik]C[W52: White counterattacks, this will help reduce Black's influence on the right side.];B[ii]C[The play of B53 is eye-dazzling, it seems that both sides like to play "big elephant" games.];W[kk]C[W54: White calmly marches into Black's moyo.];B[fh]C[B55: Black wants to fix shape in sente.]
;W[fj]LB[dh:a]C[W56: White is not willing to fall behind, since the lower side is open, White already has no state of mind to jump at 'a'.];B[gj];W[fi];B[gh];W[gi];B[hi];W[hg];B[hh];W[oi]C[W64: White probes Black.];B[pj]C[B65 is steady and not giving White any room to borrow strength.];W[md]C[W66: White seeks to fight explicitly.]
