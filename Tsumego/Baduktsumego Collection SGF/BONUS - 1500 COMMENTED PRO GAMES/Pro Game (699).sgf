Cho Chikun is the champion of Samsung Cup last year, Mimura Tomoyasu is the champion of NHK Cup last year and the second place in Asian TV Cup, two strong players clash and the game is very brilliant.];W[dd];B[fc];W[cf];B[pq]

;B[on];W[rn];B[op];W[ol];B[qk]LB[nl:a]C[The opening is new and also weird, a fight starts as soon as Black pulls out one stone with B23, of course, for Black to hane at 'a' is also playable.];W[nl];B[pi];W[oo]LB[rq:a]C[W26: White is reluctant to make the knight's move at 'a' to make life in gote, this is the right thinking, the ensuing sequence seems inevitable.];B[no];W[po]
;B[nn];W[np];B[mp];W[nq];B[mq];W[oq]LB[nr:a][mr:b][ln:c][ni:d]C[W34: However, I found out surprisingly that White can stand at 'a' instead! Next B 'b' and W34, after Black wraps up at the bottom, Black needs to guard against the cut by playing at 'c', White can play the cap at 'd', this variation is better then the real game.];B[nr];W[or];B[pr]
;W[pp];B[os];W[op];B[lr];W[mo]LB[rp:a]C[W42 looks severe but in fact that's not the case, because Black has the clever knight's move at 'a', Black can make life in sente, White has two groups outside and appears passive.

;B[jq]LB[jr:a][hl:b][rc:c][pc:d][pf:e]C[B63 is a big slow move! Here Black is worried about White's hane at 'a', actually this is only a local problem, the knight's move at 'b' is certainly an excellent point! Furthermore, Black can also play the hane at 'c', then W 'd' and B 'e', this is huge.];W[pg]C[W64: White gets to strike first, the situation becomes complicated, Black has lost his initiation.];B[ni];W[mi];B[nj];W[mk];B[ng];W[mh]
;B[og];W[pf];B[ne];W[pd];B[qe];W[rc]LB[of:a]TR[qk][ql]C[At this pivotal moment, W76 is a big bad move! White certainly should double up at 'a', this way Black is hard to attack White in the center, if Black makes life by playing at 76, it will affect the marked two stones, Black's whole board's situation is not optimistic.];B[ji]LB[pe:a]C[Because Black can push at 'a', so Black dare force with B77, Black's tempo is very good.];W[lf]

;B[do];W[en];B[cm];W[ep];B[dq];W[ip];B[iq]LB[je:a]TR[fc]C[Black continues to attack with B111, but this is unnecessary, Black should first hit at 'a' in sente, then jump out the marked black stone, separating White, Black would be leading in territory and Black's situation would be very optimistic.

;W[hg];B[gg];W[gf];B[ig];W[ij]LB[he:a]C[W130: However, White still can only play the atari at 'a'.];B[hj];W[ih];B[gk];W[if];B[fl]C[After B133 and B135, White's big dragon is being killed tragically, the outcome of the game has been decided instantly.
