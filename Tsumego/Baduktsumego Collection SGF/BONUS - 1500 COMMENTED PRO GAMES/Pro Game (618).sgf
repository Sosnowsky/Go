;W[hc];B[nc];W[po];B[qo];W[qn];B[qp];W[pn];B[nq];W[pj];B[cj]LB[qh:a][cc:b]C[The splitting move of B15 is rarely seen, the common move is to make extension at 'a' or entering the corner at 'b'.];W[qf]
;B[cm];W[cf];B[fq];W[dn];B[dm]LB[bo:a]C[The attachment of B21 is to my surprise, Black still wants to make the knight's move at 'a', this is much more substantial.];W[cn];B[em];W[dr]C[In the real game, after blocking with W22, White jumps to 24, White's corner territory is very complete.];B[db];W[ec];B[eb]
;W[fd]LB[cc:a][ed:b][fe:c][kc:d]C[The play of W26 and W28 is territory-damaging, White should take the corner at 'a', no matter whether Black makes the diagonal at 'b' or jumps to 'c' next, White will always make two-space extension at 'd', White can fight adequately.];B[gc];W[gd];B[cd];W[ce];B[hd]LB[hb:a][ib:b][bd:c]C[The cut of B33 is a very surprising move, it seems somewhat risky, and also this doesn't fit Lee Changho's style, so it looks like Lee Changho is really changing. With B33, for Black to hane at 'a' is relatively steady, next W 'b' and B 'c'.]
;W[hb];B[gb];W[ga];B[fb];W[jc]LB[cc:a][ic:b][oc:c][ib:d]C[The jump of W38 is insipid, White misses a chance to establish superiority at one stroke. With W38 White should play atari at 'a', next B 'b', although Black can capture two stones, but White can attach at 'c', and aims to turn at 'd' at any time, Black will be very painful, this way clearly White is better.];B[cc];W[gf];B[id];W[if]
;B[je];W[lc];B[jf];W[le];B[kd];W[kc];B[ig];W[hg];B[ie];W[nd];B[oc]C[The exchange of W52 and B53 makes White very painful! But in order to handle his stones at the top, White doesn't have any other choice, this is also the purpose of the earlier B33.];W[mc];B[hf]
;W[gg];B[od];W[of];B[ii];W[ci];B[di];W[ch];B[bj];W[re];B[rd];W[gi];B[nf]LB[rl:a]C[Followy B67, Black makes himself thicker in the middle and prepares to invade at 'a'.]
;W[ng];B[mf];W[mg];B[lf];W[nb];B[ob];W[ma];B[rl];W[pp]LB[rm:a]C[W76: At any rate, White should block crossover at 'a'! In the real game, Black easily crosses over, White's territory is already not enough.];B[qq];W[ql];B[qk]
;W[pk];B[qm];W[pl];B[rn];W[pm];B[rm];W[iq];B[fo];W[en]C[W86 and W88: White hopes to initiate a fight.];B[fn];W[fm];B[bn];W[bo]
;B[co]C[But Black plays the good moves of B91 and B93 to nullify the fight.];W[ep]LB[cp:a][ao:b][bp:c][bl:d]C[W94: If White plays atari at 'a', then B 'b', W 'c' and B 'd', Black already makes life, White is not good.];B[bp]C[With W94 and B95, an exchange has resulted.];W[fp];B[hq]C[Following B97, Black handles very beautifully. Although White is very thick, White must turn thickness into territory, however now the board space is clearly very small.];W[hp];B[gm];W[fl]
