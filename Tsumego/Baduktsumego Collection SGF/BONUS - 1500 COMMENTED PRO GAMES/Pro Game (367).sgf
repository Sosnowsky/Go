Translation:GoGameWorld.];B[qd]C[This is a 1st round game between the former champion Yu Bin 9p and Zhou Heyang 9p. In this game, Yu Bin 9p made two obvious mistakes which lead to his defeat.];W[dp];B[dc];W[pp];B[cn]C[The opening of B1, B3 and B5 is often used in Yu Bin's games.]
;W[cl]LB[fq:a][ci:b]C[If W6 is played as the small knight's move at 'a', Black will make the extension at 'b'.];B[cf]C[W6 and B7 are all seen with great frequency.];W[co]LB[dn:a][do:b]C[If W8 presses at 'a',  Black will immediately wedge at 'b'.];B[qn]LB[jq:a]C[B9 splitting the bottom at 'a' can also make it a game, the play in the game stresses on speed.];W[nq];B[pj]
;W[kc];B[mc];W[hd]LB[hc:a][id:b][ic:c][kd:d][fc:e]C[W14 is rarely seen, making two-space extension at 'a' is common, White worries that Black will press at 'b', after White blocks at 'c', B 'd' can expand his moyo to the right, actually White has the chance to extend to 'e' and should be satisfied. In the game, the exchange of W14 and B 'e' is a loss in territory for White. ];B[fc];W[ql];B[pl];W[pk];B[ok]
;W[qk];B[qj]LB[pm:a]C[The block at B21 is the proper move, if pulling back at 'a', White can crawl at 21 and Black's plan will fall through.];W[pm];B[ol];W[qm];B[oj];W[pd]LB[pn:a][ld:b]C[W26 strengthening at 'a' is usual, but Black's diagonal move at 'b' is too big, so White first plays at the top and it is the correct choice.];B[pc]C[Black responds simply and calmly with B27 to B33 in sente.];W[oc]
;B[qc];W[md];B[nc];W[nd];B[ob];W[ld];B[qp]C[B35 is very important to strike first here.];W[qq]LB[po:a]C[W36 is slightly unreasonable, the extension at 'a' is the proper move.];B[po];W[rp];B[qo]C[B39 forms a cramped shape but it is very practical. Because five white stones are not easy to be captured, W44 cannot help but to attach out.]
;W[op];B[rq];W[rr];B[oo];W[om];B[nm]LB[sl:a][np:b][sq:c][mq:d]C[B45 is a mistake, Black clearly has miscalculated and neglected White's good standing move at 'a'. After this move, Black has failed in the capturing race. B45 should squeeze at 'b', after  White takes at 'c', Black can double hane at 'd', this way Black can fight.];W[no];B[nn];W[on]
;B[mo];W[np];B[rm];W[rl];B[rn];W[sl]C[In the game, after W54 stands, Black can only make a seki in gote and has clearly failed.];B[rj];W[ro];B[dn]LB[sn:a]C[The extension at B57 is the correct move, if standing at 'a' to make a seki, after White's hanging move at 57, White will take a commanding lead.];W[fp];B[em]
;W[dj];B[hq]C[The checking move of B61 is a positive play,  Black gains some profit with the exchange of W62 to W64.];W[hp];B[ip];W[ho];B[gq];W[fq];B[fk];W[ch];B[mp];W[mq];B[lq];W[io]
;B[mr];W[nr];B[jp];W[fn];B[dl];W[dk]LB[bl:a]C[The contact play at W78 is questionable, it should stand at 'a', in the game White selects the ko fight and this takes a considerable risk.];B[bl];W[el];B[cm];W[dm];B[sq];W[sr]
;B[dl];W[ce];B[ck]LB[df:a][fm:b]C[But B87 eliminating the ko has missed a good opportunity! Black has abundant ko threats in the lower right and should extend to 'a' and continue the ko fight, and White is difficult to find ko threats, if White plays many damaging ko threats in the upper left corner, Black can extend to 'b' and should have no problem to settle this group.];W[df]C[After White hanes at 88, White has established his leading position.];B[lr];W[sn];B[bc]LB[fl:a]C[B91 is the losing move! it should atari at 'a', this affects the thickness and thinness of both sides in the center, and also it is a sente move, If White doesn't reinforce the corner, Black can play at 3-3 point and White is very troublesome.];W[fl];B[fm]

;W[kp];B[kq];W[gh];B[ij];W[jl]LB[hi:a]C[Before White extends to 124, White should first make the exchange of White's diagonal at 'a' and Black's connection, this is more adequate.];B[gi];W[fi];B[gj];W[fj];B[gg];W[hg];B[hh]

;B[nl];W[kn];B[lp];W[mi]C[In the game, W160 has ruined Black's territory in the center, the game is already a victory or defeat on the board. (In other words, Black doesn't have enough points to give komi.)];B[lh];W[mk];B[ml];W[kl];B[fd];W[gb];B[ga];W[ha];B[fa]
