;B[br];W[er];B[bm];W[bn];B[bl];W[bp];B[fq]C[The sequence from W6 to B25 are popular "large avalanche" joseki.];W[fr]LB[dl:a][ap:b][ao:c][bk:d][cs:e]C[W26 varies from the basic joseki. The normal play is to connect at 'a' first , followed by B 'b', W 'c', B 26, W 'd' and B 'e', forming an exchange.]
;B[ck];W[dl];B[dk];W[en];B[fo]LB[eo:a][gq:b][ep:c]C[B31 is also a novel play. The most common play for Black is to connect at 'c' to avoid the manuever of W 'a' and 'b'. Now Zhou Heyang thinks, even if White can happily play 'a' and 'b', in the mean time he also reduces his own liberties, so White is also a little painful.];W[eo];B[ep];W[gq];B[fp];W[fl]

;W[ci]LB[ho:a][gl:b][im:c][gk:d][fi:e][jn:f][jm:g]C[W50 is a wrong sequence play, this tesuji is not good timing. In any rate, White should first connect at 'a', if Black tigers at 'b', White then cuts at 'c', after B 'd' and W 'e', if Black dares to run out at 'f', W can press at 'g', Black in the center is very dangerous! If Black directly escapes at 'f', in fact White has already gained some profit with sente.];B[dj];W[dh];B[ei];W[df];B[ho]C[B55 is a good move!  The left side has pierced through, but Zhou Heyang first takes some profit at the bottom.]
;W[fi];B[eh];W[cg];B[eg];W[bj];B[bk];W[ce]C[White has no choice but to attack again with the moves 56 to 62.];B[ip]C[B63 tenukis again, reflecting Zhou's accurate calculation.];W[gh];B[gg];W[hg];B[hh]C[B67 is relentless. While being attacked, now Black wants to capure White!]
;W[fg];B[gf];W[ff];B[fh];W[gi];B[ge];W[hi]LB[ef:a]C[W74 really wants to kill Black at 'a', but after Black forcefully attaches at 74, White does not have enough liberties in the capturing race.];B[ef];W[fe];B[ee];W[fd];B[ed]
;W[gd];B[bf]C[B81 is a good move! Black's big dragon has escaped safely.];W[de];B[ec];W[he];B[bg];W[dg];B[be];W[bd];B[bh];W[dc];B[ch];W[hn]
;B[jo];W[iq];B[ho];W[eb];B[fc];W[gc];B[fb];W[bb];B[hr]LB[jq:a][ir:b][qk:c]C[B101 is another good move! if Black directly hanes down at 'a', White will certainly play somewhere else. In the game after W 'b' blocks, Black has already taken some profit, then Black can tenuki and grab the big point 'c'.];W[ir]

;B[kd];W[ld];B[le];W[ke];B[lf];W[ic];B[ka]LB[mb:a]C[B135 is brilliant! Black only need to wedge at 'a' next, White surely lacks enough liberties.];W[kf];B[lg];W[nf];B[kg];W[la]
