;B[qk];W[mp];B[kp];W[pp];B[qp];W[qo]LB[oo:a]C[W8 and 10 are popular moves lately, in the past W8 is more often to be played with the knight's move at 'a'.];B[qq];W[po];B[np]LB[nq:a]C[If B13 jumps to 'a', White has one more option of pressing at 13.];W[no] 
;B[nq];W[ok];B[pi]LB[mo:a][ql:b][nn:c]C[B17 can also cut at 'a', followed by W 'b' attachment and B 'c' atari.];W[ql];B[rl];W[rk];B[rj];W[pk];B[sk];W[qj] 
;B[qi];W[rk]LB[fq:a]C[In the game, the sequence from W18 to 26 results in a ko fight, because there are no ko threats in the opening, Black has to create ko threats by approaching the corner at 'a'.];B[fq];W[mq]C[The block of W28 is very big,  with this move, White can treat Black's corner as ko threats.];B[qk];W[hp]LB[nr:a][rk:b]C[The pincer move at W30 is unneccesary, it should hane at 'a' as a ko threat, then take the ko at 'b'.];B[fo];W[dn];B[mo]C[B33 is severe!] 
;W[nr];B[or];W[oq];B[op];W[oo];B[oq];W[lo];B[mn];W[lp];B[qm];W[rk];B[ln]C[The turn of B45 is a handy ko threat.];W[ko] 
;B[qk];W[pl]C[W48 can only connect very painfully.];B[kn];W[jo];B[mj]LB[pj:a]C[B51 is an overplay! Eliminating the ko at 'a' is a must, Black is clearly favorable. In the game, after White takes the ko, Black still do not have proper ko threats.];W[rk];B[dq]C[The purpose of B53 is to create ko threats.];W[mk];B[lk];W[lj]C[The attachment and cut of W54 and W56 are extremely alert! answering in the corner will fall into Black's trap.] 
;B[kj];W[li];B[mi]LB[ri:a][mh:b][kk:c]TR[mj]C[The following B57 and B59 are questionable, because now White is preparing to make a ko threat at 'a', White's moves in the real game help Black make the ko threat at 'b'. B57 can only handle the marked black stone lightly, such as making an extension to 'c'.];W[ri];B[qk];W[mh];B[pj];W[ni]C[W60 sets up a ko fight, with the exchange up to 64, White is very thick after capturing two black stones.]

;W[jn];B[jk];W[fi];B[kg];W[ke]C[The attack from W70 to W82 fully represents Cho 9p's soft and fast style, the attack is not that intense but the opponent feels some pressure. White is more active.];B[hr];W[fm];B[gm];W[fn];B[gn];W[lr];B[dk];W[cl]LB[dm:a]C[W90 can not be omitted, otherwise Black's attachment at 'a' will weaken the white shape dramatically.] 
;B[ck];W[bl];B[cg];W[ce];B[cn];W[dm];B[bp]LB[eg:a]C[B95 and B97 are local tesujis, but it is premature, jumping to 'a' is the proper move.];W[ci]TR[ck][dk]C[In the game W98 invades and captures two marked black stone, this is a big loss for Black!];B[fg] 
;W[di];B[oc];W[ro];B[ns];W[gd];B[ml];W[nl];B[hg];W[he];B[kc];W[pg];B[iq]LB[ms:a][ll:b][os:c][qg:d][qf:e]C[B111 is the last losing move! it helps setting up the ko fight at 'a', W 'b' is a local ko threat, if Black does not play the diagonal move at 111, B115 can not eliminate the ko. In the game, after W 'c' takes, Black's corner is dead, the loss is too big! B111 should slide at 'd' or make the knight's move at 'e', this way Black is still at a disadvantage, but at least can resist for a while.]
