;W[dc];B[kq]C[B7: Black starts with "Mini Chinese" opening and has his wishes fulfilled.];W[qj];B[pk]TR[kq]LB[kp:a]C[B9 is a novel play, Xie He 4p first played this move. If the marked black stone is at 'a', then B9 is possible, now the marked stone is one line lower, so it is not that satisfactory.];W[qk]C[In the face of the novel play, Lee Changho has no hesitation to crawl with W10.];B[ql];W[rl];B[qm];W[rm];B[qn]
;W[pj];B[ok];W[qf];B[oj]C[The turn of B19 is a huge move, as Go proverb says, a turn is worth a thousand pieces of gold.];W[pg]C[White reinforces with the diagonal extension with W20, it is a professional play.];B[nc]LB[fo:a]C[B21 is a steady move, B21 at 'a' is a territory-oriented play that bets everything on this single venture, the situation would become very intense. Lee Changho is pondering.];W[jo]LB[kp:a]TR[kq]C[Now the shallow reduction of W22 is just right, it will make a difference if the marked black stone was at 'a'.];B[ip]
;W[io];B[hp];W[lo];B[dm]C[B27: Black wouldn't allow White to connect smoothly.
];W[cm];B[dk]C[Through 29, Hua Yigang 8p thinks, Black has invested a lot here and must consider how to obtain profits.];W[em]C[W30 is a good move.];B[kp];W[ko];B[en];W[dl];B[el]
;W[dn];B[fm];W[jl]C[For the situation up to W38, Black is not easy to take control of the game, Chang Hao's opening is not successful.];B[de];W[ek]C[Chao Zhilin 9p thinks, the cut of W40 conforms to the Go proverb, "something will happen at the cut", and it has nothing to do with the ko fight.];B[dm];W[cl];B[jk]C[B43: all pros in the study room are astounded by this move, Chang Hao's play is overzealous and it is not satisfactory.];W[kk];B[il];W[kl];B[im]
;W[jj]LB[ej:a]TR[jk]C[W48: White should extend to 'a', how Black can respond? White must wage the tit-for-tat play against the marked black stone and spoil the opponent's conception and will.];B[ik];W[li];B[ej]TR[ik]LB[fk:a][dj:b]C[Because of the marked black stone, White can not escape at 'a', if W 'a', then B 'b'.];W[eq];B[fr];W[ck]
;B[fk]TR[jk]C[After Black takes with B55, the outcome resulting from the marked black stone is acceptable for Black, but with regard to the whole board situation, White is not bad.];W[rd];B[kc]
(;W[fc]LB[ce:a][dd:b][cd:c][ec:d][cc:e]C[The one-space extension of W58 is of a winning attitude, White should attach under at 'a', followed by B 'b', W 'c', B 'd' and W 'e' (see var a). The playing atmosphere is very subtle, Chang Hao's carelessness lets Lee Changho see the winning chance, but due to the mental contradiction, Lee Changho instead doesn't want to take more risks. However, to win a game is not that simple.];B[cc];W[cb];B[cd];W[bb];B[ci]C[The difference of the game has been narrowed.];W[er];B[es]
;W[ds];B[fs];W[cr];B[mp];W[qq];B[rq];W[pp];B[qr];W[mo];B[np];W[qo];B[pq];W[ro]
;B[on]C[White should not play in the lower right, the play in the game is bad.];W[pn];B[pm];W[oo];B[po];W[mc];B[md];W[pn];B[no];W[om];B[po];W[nd];B[ne]
;W[pn];B[nn];W[ld];B[od];W[lc]LB[rn:a][pl:b]TR[li][jj][kk][kl][jl][mo][lo][ko][jo][io]SQ[on][nn][no]C[As to the current situation, if White's ko threats are favorable and he can force the exchange of W 'a' and B 'b', it is certainly very good, but if the ko threats are not to White's advantage, this small profit can not be taken. However, due to the square-marked black stones, the eye space of the trigangle-marked white stones is also ruined, White will come under attack.]

;W[mn];B[fe]TR[jg][ih][mk][mn]C[Being attacked, White has to make a small life, with the exchange of the marked black and white stones, Black has already turned the game around.];W[gd];B[id];W[dd];B[jd];W[ib];B[be];W[kd];B[op]
;W[ge];B[ji]LB[nm:a][qc:b]C[B121: Black ataris in sente, if White reinforce at 'a', then Black will grab the big endgame at 'b'.];W[ij]C[Lee Changho probably has misread, also maybe he tries to seek an excuse to concede defeat.];B[jm]C[B123: Black is delighted to deliver the killing move.
];W[km];B[nj];W[nl];B[jn];W[kn];B[lm]C[Chang Hao has redeemed one game but still trails by 1:2 in best-of-5 series.]
