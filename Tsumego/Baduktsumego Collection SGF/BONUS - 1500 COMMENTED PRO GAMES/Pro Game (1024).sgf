;B[dd];W[cd];B[ec]C[In the opening, they played the famous "large avalanche" joseki in the upper-left corner. I don't like to play this pattern, because one quarter of the board is gone after this joseki, the charm and deepness of game inevitably will be reduced a lot.];W[cc];B[df];W[cg];B[kc]LB[eb:a][fc:b]C[In the game, it leads to a simple "large avalanche" variation. As to this variation, White can elect to play hane at 'a' or clamp at 'b' later on based on situation.];W[qj];B[ql];W[qg]
;B[od];W[eb];B[fc];W[fb];B[gc]LB[og:a][oj:b]C[As to W22, White can elect to jump to 'a' or 'b' (please see variation a and b), it is hard to say which is better.]
(;W[nf]C[W22 shows Ma Xiaochun's "demon knife" style, his play is very nimble and cunning. However White clearly has connection defect.];B[fq]C[B23: When Gu Li plays the ladder breaker, Ma Xiaochun makes an obvious mistake, he is a little careless.];W[hq];B[og];W[pe];B[pd];W[ld];B[of]C[After Black pushes with B29, White incurs loss first.];W[kd];B[jd];W[jc];B[lc]

(;W[fe]C[Through W42, I think White's attacking direction is wrong.];B[gf]LB[eh:a]C[Normally to square-strike with W42 is a good move, but it should be handled differently according to surrounding. After Black caps with B43, White is clearly not good. With W42 White should make knight at 'a' (please see variation a), then conduct a two-pronged attack, White definitely will gain some profit.];W[ge];B[ff];W[hf];B[dg];W[hh]C[The jump of W48 is good move.];B[cf]C[In this shape, Black pushes down with B49, White is indeed very painful. However when White can capture three black stones, this push becomes very light.];W[ch];B[bf]
;W[dj]C[Ma Xiaochun's play is very natural and unrestrained.];B[gi];W[oi];B[dm];W[fj];B[eo]C[The play of B57 is an overplay, this move means "your is mine, mine is still mine". Here Gu Li's play is very efficient, we can see it in many of his games. However, high-efficient moves are all a little unreasonable, the key is whether you can see and exploit its defect.];W[do];B[en];W[gh];B[di]C[B53 and B61 are excellent moves!];W[ei];B[dh]

;B[bj]C[Please see variation a.]
(;W[fm]LB[ep:a]C[The order of W78 is not right, White should first push at 'a' (please see variation a), this way Gu Li has no chance to turn body around.];B[gm];W[ep];B[hp]C[Since White didn't exchange, Gu Li easily turns body around.];W[fo];B[fn];W[gn];B[fm];W[fp];B[fh];W[gj]
;B[hm];W[iq];B[hi];W[ih];B[cq];W[bp];B[hj]C[Through B95, Gu Li captures several stones in the center. Black is leading in territory and also very thick on the board. White already has no chance to win.];W[oe];B[ne];W[me];B[nd];W[ng];B[mf]
