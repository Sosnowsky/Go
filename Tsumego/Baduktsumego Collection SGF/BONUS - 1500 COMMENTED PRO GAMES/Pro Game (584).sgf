Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[I'm afraid most of us never heard Ok deukjin this name, he is a young and strong player. In this game, he played very well, giving some time, his future can't be underestimated!];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[fc]
;W[hc];B[nc];W[po];B[pl];W[oq]C[W10: We once spent a lot of time to study this outside attachment, so we used it quite often in international games, now Ok deukjin dares play this move in such an important match, it shows he is very diligent and he has his own view as to this shape.];B[or]C[The hane of B11 is simple and clear, Won SeongJin tries to avoid the "flying-knife".];W[op];B[nr];W[qq];B[qr];W[pp];B[pr]
;W[qj]LB[lp:a]C[W18: White seeks to fight positively, but this more is not necessarily good. The original move is to jump at 'a'.];B[qm];W[lo];B[qg];W[kc];B[cf]LB[lq:a][oj:b]C[B23 is the reason why Black falls behind in the opening. Here is not the vital point for the situation, the offense and defense on the right side is just the key for the game. Black should play at 'a' to tie up White, White will escape at 'b', this way the exchange of W18 and B19 will be very damaging, Black can fight.];W[df]C[White's selection of joseki following W24 is just right.];B[dg];W[ef]
;B[cd];W[cc];B[ce];W[dc];B[ch];W[gf]C[White's several stones near W32 helps a lot to the fight on the right side.];B[cn];W[fp];B[bp]LB[dk:a]C[B35: Black should make extension back at 'a', this way the left-side shape is solid and it will be favorable to the fight in the center. Overall, to play on the left side, you must take into account the imminent fierce fight in the center.];W[di]LB[cj:a]C[W36 is a good move! White has a brilliant foresight to exchange with B 'a', it seems White already reads through the following dozen moves.]
;B[cj];W[oj]C[W38 pulling out is severe! Since White is thick in the middle, this also has the characteristic of attacking Black.];B[nl];W[mj];B[ll];W[lq];B[rq]LB[kk:a]C[B43 is the losing move! Although Black will be exploited terribly if White descends at 43, but the whole game is more important, Black would still can insist if making the diagonal at 'a'.];W[kj];B[jl];W[ip]C[W44 and W46 are excellent tempo, White already forms territory at the bottom and also has unlimited potential at the top.];B[ij]LB[ik:a][ii:b]C[B47: The original move is to make the diagonal at 'a', but this way after W 'b', Black is also clearly not good.]
;W[ik]C[B47 is a game-deciding move, as to this, the counterattack of W48 is severe! If White misses this fighting chance, the game will last very long.];B[jk];W[jj];B[ii];W[hk];B[jh];W[lg]C[After this move, it is time for lunch break.];B[fi];W[hm];B[jn];W[eg]C[When W58, Black couldn't connect, the effect lies in the beautiful should-hit of W36!];B[eh]
;W[dh];B[cg];W[dj];B[fk];W[ck];B[ci];W[dm]C[When W66, White can sacrifice or take, Black is being tangled on both sides, really painful!];B[dl]C[B67: Black can capture five stones in a ladder, Black is already not bad.];W[dk];B[cl];W[fh];B[ei]
;W[gi]C[W72: But White can capture three stones which contains some virtual territory, the value is much bigger than Black's capturing just five lonely stones, Black is in a losing situation.];B[ek];W[cm];B[bl];W[gh];B[jp];W[io];B[jo];W[jq];B[kd];W[lc];B[me];W[kf]
;B[ke];W[jf];B[ng];W[oh];B[ie]LB[og:a][jd:b]C[B89: Black has no choice but to invade inside, if Black blocks at 'a', White will hane at 'b' to enclose territory, this equals to conceding defeat!];W[pf];B[pg];W[oc]C[W90 and W92 are beautiful tactic for destroying territory, here Black couldn't possibly capture White.];B[ni]C[B93: Black's play is already in a mess.];W[og]
;B[of];W[pe];B[pd];W[oe];B[od];W[nf];B[ne];W[mk]C[Through W102, Black again incurs loss.];B[nn];W[cq];B[eo];W[fm];B[dn]
;W[mp];B[mf];W[om];B[on];W[of];B[rf];W[mg];B[pi];W[oi];B[bq]LB[ol:a]C[B117: Black seeks a way to concede defeat, if Black strengthens to make life at 'a', White will block at 117, Black still will lose big even just on the board.];W[ol]C[After W118, Black's big dragon is simply being killed.]
