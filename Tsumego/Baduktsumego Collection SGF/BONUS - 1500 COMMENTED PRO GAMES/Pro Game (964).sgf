;W[nq];B[pj];W[nc];B[pc];W[ed];B[gc];W[kc];B[ec]C[The opening up to B13 is steady.];W[cn];B[ci]C[B15: It seems Black should split the lower side, but it is not easy to find an appropriate point for now, so Black changes the playing direction.];W[ip];B[on]C[After White makes extension on the side with W16, B17 is good point.]
;W[ne]LB[mo:a]C[The jump of W18 is over casual, White should make knight at 'a' and see how Black to expand his moyo.];B[qq]C[After Black enters the corner, White suffers loss in territory.];W[nn]LB[qp:a][pq:b][oq:c][rp:d][oo:e]C[W20 is questionable move, White should block at 'a' and see how Black to proceed. If Black crawls at 'b', then W 'c', B 'd' and W 'e'.];B[oo];W[qp];B[mp]C[B23 is good move, White is difficult.]
;W[no]LB[pq:a]C[However, with W24 White can only tolerate at 'a'.];B[op];W[np]C[In the exchange, Black's territory is big and Black is also thick.];B[oq]C[White is not easy to control his moyo.];W[om]LB[or:a]C[The purpose of W28 is to take advantage by playing hane at 'a'.];B[nm]LB[pm:a]C[B29: Even if Black hangs at 'a', White also has no good follow-up maneuver.];W[or]
;B[pq];W[mm];B[nl];W[ml];B[nk];W[mk];B[nj];W[dj]LB[eq:a]C[W38 expanding moyo in large scale is over zealous. White's situation is not good, but White still can only strengthen at 'a', slowly waiting for chances.];B[dr];W[cq]LB[eq:a]C[W40: White perhaps can only play at 'a' and allow Black to live the corner.]
;B[gq];W[iq]C[White perhaps thinks the loss in the lower right corner and can't treat the situation calmly.];B[go];W[eq];B[hn];W[hl];B[jn];W[ln];B[eo]C[After B49, White basically can't kill Black.];W[fn];B[ep];W[dq]
;B[dn];W[cm];B[gm];W[em];B[gl];W[el]C[From W50 and W58, White has no choice but to continue attacking.];B[io];W[gk];B[kq]C[After B59, the invasion of B61 is good move.];W[kp];B[jp]C[Only if Black can tight liberties, Black will make life naturally.];W[jq]
;B[ko]C[But in the game it leads to a ko, White is also clearly not good.];W[jo];B[dm];W[jp]LB[dl:a][hk:b]C[W68: White must answer at 'a', although Black has many ko threats by cutting at 'b', White has no other alternatives.];B[dl];W[fk];B[cj]C[After Black crawls back with B71, White fails badly. So far, it is not exaggerating if we say the game is over.];W[qf];B[pf]LB[od:a]C[As to the invasion of W72, Black should peep at 'a' with B73.]
;W[pg];B[of];W[qh];B[og]LB[ri:a]C[B77 is also not necessary, to make knight at 'a' is just fine.];W[qj];B[qk];W[pi];B[rj];W[ri]C[In the game, it forms a ko fight, the situation is a little complicated.];B[qi];W[fc]
;B[fd];W[dc];B[fb];W[eb];B[ee];W[fc];B[fe];W[cc];B[oi];W[qj];B[nr];W[mr];B[qi]
;W[hp];B[gp];W[qj];B[er];W[cl];B[dk];W[pk];B[qi];W[fo]LB[do:a]C[W106: For White to squeeze at 'a' is perhaps the last chance.];B[do]C[B107 is the urgent point!];W[fp]C[After W108, Black unexpectedly lives in sente!]
;B[fq]C[Kong Jie advances to the final of Chang-ki Cup for the last three times!];W[bp];B[co];W[bo];B[br];W[cr];B[bq];W[cp];B[cs];W[bs];B[as];W[ds];B[es]
