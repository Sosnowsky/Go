;W[dd];B[cp];W[pj]C[Takemiya Masaki 9p seeks speed in the opening and doesn't care too much about the side and corner.];B[nq];W[oo]C[W12: Takemiya uses this move again, after he defeated Mok Jinseok in last game, Takemiya becomes more confident.];B[lp];W[ln];B[jo]C[W14 and B15: Both sides play on their own.];W[mp];B[mq];W[kp];B[ko]
;W[lo]LB[mn:a]C[From W16 to W20, White strengthens in sente and prevents Black from attaching out at 'a'.];B[lq];W[jm]LB[qf:a]C[W22: For White to approach the corner at 'a' is more substantial.];B[qh];W[oh];B[qj];W[qk];B[pk];W[oj];B[ql]
;W[rk];B[rl]C[When Black approaches low with B23, B25 to B31 are all planned moves to counter the cap of W24.];W[rj];B[qi];W[pl];B[ok];W[nk];B[ol];W[pm];B[nl];W[nj];B[ri];W[ml]
;B[sj];W[nm];B[sk]C[Through B45, Black is favorable, the reason is White's shape appears duplicate.];W[dm]C[Although W46 is important, but it seems a little far-fetched.];B[dn]LB[cm:a]C[The push and cut of B47 is inevitable, to crawl at 'a' is too weak.];W[en];B[em];W[cm];B[bm];W[bl];B[bn]
;W[dk];B[el];W[io]C[W56 is an asking move.];B[ip]LB[hp:a]C[Later on White is left with the double hane at 'a'.];W[dj];B[fn]C[B59 is a good move, White is not easy to handle.];W[gk]C[W60: It is hard to judge whether White is tenacious or has no other choices.];B[fc]C[B61 approaching the corner first is a good move, to capture three stones in the lower left corner is too small.];W[hc];B[cc]
;W[dc];B[cd];W[de];B[ce]C[B67: Black aims to grab sente.];W[cf];B[bf];W[bg];B[db];W[eb];B[cb];W[ec];B[cg];W[df]
;B[bh]C[Through W68, although White takes sente, but White's loss is also not small.];W[md];B[dh];W[eh];B[ei];W[di]C[W80 and W82 are the strongest moves, but White's aji is not good.];B[ic];W[ib];B[fb]C[B85 is alert, White can't resist.];W[fd];B[jb];W[jc]
;B[id];W[gb];B[kc];W[jd];B[ia];W[hb];B[ld]C[B95 is a good move.];W[je];B[mc]C[So far, White enters into byo-yomi, Black has used 34 minutes.];W[le];B[me];W[nd]

;W[oc];B[pc];W[na];B[pb];W[ka]C[So far, Black sacrifices in sente.];B[ho]C[Black comes back to strengthen with B119, Black is clearly favorable.];W[in];B[gm];W[hp];B[go]LB[hl:a]C[B123: Black sacrifices two stones in order to stick the head out at 'a'.];W[jp]

;W[gl];B[hn];W[dg];B[ch];W[bi];B[ci];W[bj];B[qq]C[Afterwards, Black plays very simply and clearly, White already has no chance to win. White's losing cause is White fails in the fights of both the right side and the lower left corner.];W[om];B[qk];W[jq];B[jr];W[jn]
