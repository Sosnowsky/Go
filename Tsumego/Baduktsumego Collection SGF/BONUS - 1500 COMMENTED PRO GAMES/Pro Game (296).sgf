As a result, Cho Chikun 9p was calm and steady in an unfavorable situation, killed his opponent's stones with clever plays, defeated Park YuongHoon 4p by resignation, winning the champion and the prize of 100 million Korean Won.];W[dc];B[pq];W[dq];B[de]

Normally White will play the splitting move at 'a' or 'b', breaking up Black's moyo.];B[ql]C[In the game, after B15, Black's configuration is ideal. Cho Chikun elects to play this way even though he knows that this opening is not favorable for White, perhaps he intentionally wants to force Black to play moyo, then dive into Black's territory and try to win the game by fighting with Black.]

(;B[oh]LB[rk:a][rj:b][ri:c][pg:d][ph:e][rh:f]C[B35: Black plays the cap in order to expand his moyo, but after White makes life with the knight's move at 'a', Black is not happy. Black can consider to disrupt White's base by playing at 'b', if White sticks his head out at 35, then Black crawls at 'c', next Black pushes at 'd', W 'e' and B 'f' is sente, White's big group is not alive (see var a).];W[rk];B[qk];W[rl];B[rm];W[qj];B[sl]

(;B[rp]LB[sm:a][rg:b][or:c][pr:d][nq:e][lm:f]C[B107 is slow. Black certainly should connects at 'a', then W 'b', B 'c', W 'd' and B 'e' (see var a). Next Black can either exploit White's lower-right corner or chase-and-kill White's big dragon at 'f'. No matter which one Black selects, Black's victory is all within reach.];W[nr]LB[mo:a]C[W108 is wrong sequence, White should first play the atari at 'a'.];B[lm];W[mo];B[lo];W[np]

Park YuongHoon worries that White will kill Black in the lower side by connecting at 'b'. However when W 'b', Black has the clever move at 'c'. Moreover, when Black retreats at 'a', if White kills the corner at 'd', then B 'e', W 'f', B 'g', W 'h' and B 'i', if White separates Black strongly, Black also will separate White, Black can initiate a ko fight by B 'j', W 'k', B 'l', W 'm' and B 'n' (see var a). Because if White loses the ko fight, White's big group will die, so White dare not kill Black's corner.]
