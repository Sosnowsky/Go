Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[pd]C[Xie He and Hu Yaoyu are all strong players in the quarter final. Xie He knocked out Lee Sedol in this year's Chunlan Cup and helped Chinese to win the champion in advance.];W[dd];B[pq];W[dq];B[qo]
;W[jq];B[do];W[fp]C[In fast games, both sides should play their most familiar openings.];B[cf]C[But following B9, Xie He wants to lead to a situation where both sides are not easy to control of.];W[di];B[cq];W[cr];B[ck];W[cm];B[dm];W[cn];B[fc]
;W[fd];B[gd];W[fe];B[ec];W[dc];B[dg];W[ce];B[ci];W[dl];B[jc];W[df];B[bf];W[dh]TR[cq][do][dm]C[As a result, B7, B11 and B15 (the marked stones) are being separated, and also White bumps with W30, Black is very painful. We can only say Black's opening strategy fails.]
;B[cg]C[B31: Black can only tolerate.];W[cj]C[W32: White still wants to bully the opponent.];B[dj]C[B33: Black has no choice but to counterattack.];W[ch];B[bj];W[bh]C[However, the fight following W36 should be to White's advantage.];B[fg];W[ej];B[cl]LB[ek:a]C[Next B39 is crude move, Black should simply play hane at 'a', this way Black is also not good, but Black can only play this way.];W[dn]
;B[ek];W[em]C[White takes one stone with W42, White's corner already becomes territory, Black is clearly not good.];B[fj];W[fi]C[W44 is good move, Black has no good follow-up.];B[gj];W[ei];B[el];W[gi];B[ef];W[hj];B[gl];W[de]
;B[gg];W[fm];B[fl];W[gc];B[hc];W[ge];B[gb];W[hh];B[hf];W[be]LB[hg:a]C[W62: White should squeeze at 'a'.];B[ii];W[hi]
;B[ae];W[ad];B[af];W[bc];B[bi]LB[hg:a]C[After B69, White already has no time to squeeze at 'a'.];W[qf];B[re];W[jg]LB[pi:a]C[W72: For White to jump at 'a' is normal.];B[eq];W[er]
;B[pi];W[pb]C[W76 is a surprising move.];B[pc]LB[oc:a]C[B77: For Black to make diagonal at 'a' is also playable.];W[qe];B[rd];W[rb]C[W80 is an asking move.];B[rc]LB[qc:a]C[B81: If Black turns at 'a' instead, it is ugly but substantial.];W[oc]C[After White plays hane with W82, White already prepares to sacrifice W78 and W80 two stones.]
;B[od];W[nc];B[mb]LB[of:a]C[B85: Black perhaps should jump to 'a'.];W[mc];B[lb];W[me];B[of];W[qk];B[mg];W[ke]C[After W92, White is able to connect and can be satisfied. White is favorable for the game.];B[ri]
;W[ni]LB[nk:a][nh:b][nq:c]C[W94 is unnecessary! For White make big jump at 'a' is steady, next White can aim to jump in at 'b' and make extension at 'c', this way White is sailing smoothly.];B[ok];W[oh];B[ph];W[og];B[nf];W[pg];B[lh];W[qh];B[qi]
;W[rh];B[pk];W[nk];B[nl];W[mk];B[ig]C[After White is separated by B109, three white groups are all dangerous, it is really scary.];W[ne];B[pf];W[kh]LB[hg:a][ih:b]C[Since White didn't squeeze at 'a' originally, White has no choice but to play W112 and can't push through at 'b'.];B[ih]LB[kg:a]C[B113: Black misses a good chance! To squeeze at 'a' is just the vital point!]
;W[mf];B[ng];W[lg]C[Instead White gets to squeeze with W116, it makes a big difference in eye shape.];B[li];W[ki];B[lj];W[kj];B[lk];W[ml]C[After W118 to W112, the game becomes chaotic.];B[kk];W[if];B[ie]
;W[jf];B[hg];W[jk];B[km]LB[ij:a]C[B129: Black should push at 'a'.];W[ij];B[lf];W[kg];B[ln]LB[mn:a]C[W133: White should make knight at 'a'.];W[mn];B[mo]
;W[no]C[After W134 and W136, Black already has no certainty to kill White.];B[nm];W[mm];B[nn]C[But B137 and B139 is clearly hasty moves.];W[ol];B[pl];W[lo];B[mp];W[ko]LB[kl:a][nq:b]C[After W144, 'a' and 'b' become miai, Black can't take care of both.];B[oi]
;W[nh];B[nj];W[mj];B[oj];W[mi];B[lm];W[oo];B[pn];W[nq];B[mq];W[nr];B[kq];W[lq]C[Hu Yaoyu advanced to the final four.]
