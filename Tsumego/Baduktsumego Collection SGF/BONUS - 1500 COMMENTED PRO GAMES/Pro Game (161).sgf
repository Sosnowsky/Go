(;SZ[19]EV[Japan Meijin Retirement Match]KM[0]PW[Honinbo Shusai]PB[Kitani Minoru]BR[7p]DT[1938-6-26]RE[B+5]C[Copyright by gogameworld.com and weiqi.tom.com.

This game is the 21st Honinbo Shusai Meijin's retirement game. At the time of the game, Honinbo Shusai was already 64 years' old. Although Shusai Meijin lost this game regrettably, but overall White had managed and played brilliantly, adequately reflecting Meijin's elegant skill, therefore this game is still regarded as one of his marvelous masterpiece.];B[qd]C[Black is Kitani Minoru, he was one of few strongest players at that time (29 year's old), in the challenger game held between 1937 and 1938, he defeated all other top players and earned the right to play this Shusai Meijin's retirement game.];W[qp];B[dq];W[co];B[ep]LB[cd:a]C[The diagonal's extension of B5 is steady, now certainly Black can also take the empty corner at 'a'.]
;W[od];B[oc];W[nc];B[pc];W[md];B[ne];W[oe]LB[nd:a]C[As to the strike of B11, White normally will connect at 'a', the extension of W12 is Shusai's style.];B[nb];W[nf];B[mb]LB[lc:a]C[B15: Black can also make the knight's move at 'a'.]
;W[nq];B[pf]LB[cd:a]TR[nq]C[White makes a large knight's corner enclosure with the marked stone, although B17 is a very substantial move, but Black's speed appears a little slow, Black can consider to take the empty corner at 'a'.];W[ce];B[cc];W[ed];B[ec];W[fc];B[fd];W[gd]C[The atari of W24 is a thoughtful move.];B[fe]
;W[ee];B[gc]C[B27 is inevitable, now being captured in a ladder can't be tolerated.];W[fb];B[eb];W[gb];B[ff];W[hc];B[ef];W[cd];B[bc];W[ch];B[di]TR[ch]C[After the marked two-space extension and the shoulder-hit of B37, it leads to a situation where Black obtains influence and White takes territory.]
;W[ci];B[dj];W[cj];B[dk];W[ck];B[dl];W[cm];B[dn];W[cn];B[dm]LB[jp:a][jc:b]C[With the connection of B47, Black has completely strengthened himself, giving White the excellent point at 'a'. As to this move, most professionals disagree, in the book of "Meijin Honinbo Shusai", it points out that with B47 Black is over-confident to his thickness, Black should first occupy the big point at 'a'. In fact, from the following game process, for Black to directly play at 'b' is best, first attacking White at the top, then making the decision on how to handle the lower side, the reason will be explained later.];W[jp]
;B[jc];W[je]C[W50 is a good point at this time.];B[ie]C[B51: Black attacks White strongly.];W[jd];B[id];W[ic];B[kc];W[if];B[he];W[jf];B[hf];W[jb]
;B[kb];W[ia];B[no];W[np];B[lo];W[lp];B[le]C[The exchange of B63-B65 with W64-W66 is to prepare to attack with B67, but it seems far-fetched.];W[lf];B[kf];W[me];B[lg];W[mf]C[The sequence from W68 to W72 is inevitable.]
;B[ke];W[kg];B[kd];W[lh];B[jg];W[mg]C[The sequence from B73 to W78 is normal from both sides, the situation is about even. However from the whole game's viewpoint, Black's efficiency of playing first is already not obvious.];B[ph];W[jh];B[ig];W[ql];B[qj]C[B79 and B83: Black is no hurry, steadily grabbing territory is Kitani Minoru's style.];W[rj]
;B[ri];W[ol];B[rk]LB[qo:a]C[White jumps with W86, then B87 is a thick move, when the time is ripe, Black can attach at 'a' to destroy White's territory.];W[ko]LB[gq:a]C[W88 is also a thick play. Now if White makes the extension at 'a', Black will play the reduction on the back of White's left thickness.];B[hq]C[B89 is the biggest move, so far the game is very close.];W[hp];B[gp];W[gq]C[With W90 and W92, White aims to make Black over-concentrated and also take the chance to expand his center influence.];B[hr]C[The stand of B93 is the right move.]
;W[iq];B[ho];W[ip];B[gr];W[kl];B[ki];W[kh]C[The connection of W100 is a move that Shusai Meijin regrets.];B[rm]C[The jump-in of B101 is the biggest endgame.];W[rl];B[sl];W[qm];B[rn]
;W[qo];B[bp]C[B107 is a big gote endgame worth about 20 points.];W[dg]LB[be:a]C[The diagonal's extension of W108 guards against Black's attachment at 'a'.];B[bd];W[be];B[dc]C[B109 and B111 are original moves.];W[go];B[fq];W[hn];B[oj];W[nj]
;B[ni];W[mj];B[ok];W[nk]LB[nl:a]C[W120: White is not falling behind, from the shape, White should retreat at 'a', but now the game is very close, one little retreat may affect the outcome of the game.];B[hd]LB[ea:a][da:b][fa:c][ba:d][ha:e][ka:f]C[B121 is so subtle! If there is no exchange of B121 and W122, after W 'a', B 'b', W 'c' and B 'd', if Black plays at 121, White will make eye by playing at 'e', this way, Black's stand at 'f' is not sente any more.];W[hb]
;B[qn];W[pn];B[sp];W[rq];B[mi];W[li];B[nl]C[The cut of B129 is an asking move.];W[ro]C[W130: In this crucial moment, W130 is an unexpected big mistake, the outcome of the game thus has been decided.];B[nm];W[om];B[lj]C[As to the mistake of W130, Black starts to exert power.];W[mk]
;B[lk];W[ml];B[ll];W[mm];B[lm];W[mn];B[ln];W[mo];B[jj]C[Through B143, Black is like a sharp knife piercing into White's territory, thus the game has been decided at one stroke.];W[ir];B[so]C[W144 and B145 are big endgames, each side gets one.];W[sq]
;B[sm];W[bo];B[bq];W[ik];B[ij]C[B151: So far, White's small-margin defeat can't be redeemed.];W[hj];B[ii];W[jk];B[hl];W[hk];B[fo];W[gn];B[gl]
