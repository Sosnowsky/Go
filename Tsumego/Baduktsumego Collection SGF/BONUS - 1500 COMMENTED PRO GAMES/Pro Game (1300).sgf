;W[cn];B[jp];W[qf];B[pi];W[pn];B[qp];W[pk];B[nd];W[op];B[oq];W[mp];B[oo]C[The opening from both sides is not following conventional patterns.];W[hq]C[The invasion of W18 is nimble. If White directly plays on the right side, White instead doesn't have any good follow-up.]
;B[on]LB[hp:a][ip:b]C[B19: If Black presses at 'a', then White can wedge at 'b',  which is just right. Black will achieve nothing.];W[jq]C[Following W20, it leads to a fight, both sides can fight.];B[kq];W[kp];B[lq];W[jo];B[ip];W[iq];B[io];W[ko]
;B[mq];W[gp];B[in];W[km];B[il];W[fp];B[kk];W[ml];B[ol]C[The cut of B37 is inevitable.];W[mj];B[ok];W[jk]C[The crosscut of W40 is severe!]
;B[jl];W[kl];B[lk];W[mk];B[jn];W[kn];B[ik];W[jj];B[ii];W[ij];B[hj];W[hi]C[The more fearful play is the push and cut of W50 and W52! This severe tactic must be unexpected by Kobayashi.];B[gi]C[However, following B53, Black handles very calmly.]
;W[hh];B[ki];W[gj];B[hk];W[ji];B[fj];W[ih];B[dn];W[li];B[cm];W[co]C[Through W64, Black didn't seem to incur any loss.];B[dm]LB[pj:a]C[But the connection of B65 is slow. Black should bump at 'a' and capture two white stones, the value is very big.]
;W[pl]C[White crawls with W66 and makes life, it is huge.];B[dq];W[eq];B[er];W[ep];B[cq];W[fr];B[fs];W[gr];B[pm]LB[pj:a]C[B75: Black still should bump at 'a', although White can make life, it wouldn't be that big as in the game.];W[qm]
;B[om];W[pj];B[oj];W[qi];B[qh];W[ph];B[oi];W[ri];B[qj];W[rl];B[rh];W[rj];B[pg]C[Through B89, White is clearly favorable.]
;W[kc]LB[cf:a]C[W90: For White to protect the corner at 'a' is clearly better.];B[cf];W[ce];B[df];W[ec];B[gh];W[bo]C[White perhaps wants Black to form side territory, then he can show the cleverness of W96.];B[fd];W[fc];B[hd];W[pb]C[W100 again is a good move to "wash territory", making Black painful.]
;B[qc];W[mc];B[bf];W[be];B[jd];W[ap]C[After White captures Black's corner with W106, White is clearly leading in territory.];B[jc];W[qb];B[cc];W[bc];B[rb];W[nc];B[kb]
;W[lb];B[kd];W[lc];B[jb];W[ne];B[od];W[le];B[kh];W[kj];B[lh]C[Following B123, Black loses common sense.];W[mh];B[mg]C[White in the upper right corner is already alive, to separate White is meaningless.]
;W[nh];B[me];W[mf];B[md];W[pc];B[rd];W[lg]C[Through W132, Black again incurs loss.];B[kg];W[lf]C[It seems Kobayashi doesn't have much of fighting spirit, not sure whether this is related to three consecutive losses.];B[ld];W[ma];B[rn]
