;W[od];B[fd];W[qc];B[eb];W[kc];B[be];W[pd]C[With the sequence from B5 to W12, both sides played on their own, showing their playing psychology, either side is not willing to fall behind.];B[qe];W[rc];B[qh]LB[pj:a]TR[qd][qe]C[B15: Black can also consider to make an extension at 'a', because White already has the descent of W14, allowing White to capture the marked two stones is not too bad.]
;W[qj]C[The forcing move of W16 is inevitable.];B[qn];W[oi];B[og];W[mh];B[ne];W[mc];B[jq]C[Black plays at the big point with the extension of B23, also aiming at White's two crosscuts.];W[kp];B[jp];W[ko]LB[kn:a][mf:b]C[But the extension of W26 is too heavy! If White ever wants to play here, White should jump to 'a', otherwise White should tenuki to jump at 'b', first attacking Black is also playable.]
;B[jo];W[kn];B[ni]C[White definitely didn't expect after Black attaches one more move of B27, the crosscut of B29 is still effective.];W[nj];B[mi];W[oh]LB[nh:a]C[The hit of W32 is weak and doesn't look life Gu Li's style! Although the ladder is not favorable, White still wants to push at 'a' to fight a direct confrontation with Black. In the game, White captures one black stone in gote, the aji is also not good, White's situation is not favorable.];B[nh];W[pg];B[pf];W[qg];B[ng]
;W[ok];B[fq];W[cn];B[dr];W[qf];B[pe];W[me]LB[ck:a][ld:b]C[W44: In theory, White can't play here, White should grab the big point with the two-space extension at 'a', but after Black's knight's move at 'b', White is a little uncomfortable.];B[mf];W[oe];B[of];W[le]
;B[im]LB[mj:a][mk:b][lk:c][ml:d][cl:e]C[The knight's move of B49 is favorable consciousness, if Black is more positive, Black can consider to turn at 'a', then W 'b', B 'c' and W 'd', Black can take tenuki to grab the big point at 'e', this way Black is clearly leading in the game.];W[kk];B[ki];W[ck];B[oq];W[dg]LB[bg:a]C[The exchange of W54 and B55 is a little damaging to territory, with W54 playing at 'a' is relatively better.

;W[gb];B[ec];W[go];B[gp];W[hd];B[ql];W[pm];B[pn];W[rk];B[rl]LB[fo:a]C[With B61 and B65, Black all should hang at 'a', it is not only a big point but also related to the thinness and thickness of both sides.];W[lj];B[jh]
;W[cf];B[ce];W[cq]LB[fo:a][eq:b][er:c][hp:d][hq:e][fp:f][gq:g][jn:h][ij:i]TR[im]C[The corner-diagonal of W70 is the last losing move. If White extends at 'a', then B70, W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 'e', W 'f' and B 'g', White would be still left with the tactic of playing the push at 'h' to capture the marked black stone, then White first attacks Black's big group at 'i', and takes the chance to capture the marked stone, this way the situation would be still very complicated.];B[pj]
;W[pi]C[Afterwards, although they played another 100 moves, but White never got any chance. In this game, Kong Jie's performance is obviously better than Gu Li's.];B[fo]C[After Black hangs at 73, although Black's advantage is not very big, but because Black is thick across the board, White is very hard to turn the game around.];W[kq];B[em];W[ik];B[jl];W[jk];B[hh];W[jr];B[ir];W[lr];B[cm]
