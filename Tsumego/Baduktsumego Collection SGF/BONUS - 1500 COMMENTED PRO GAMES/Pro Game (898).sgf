;W[qn];B[on];W[no];B[ol]LB[nn:a]C[B23: Normally Black would press at 'a', With B23 Black takes the whole board configuration into account.];W[lq]C[The play after W24 is very naked.];B[kr];W[kq];B[jq];W[mr];B[nr];W[mq]
;B[ms];W[jp];B[iq];W[ip];B[hq];W[mm]C[Through 36, it seems White can fight.];B[qm]

(;B[bd]LB[fc:a][ed:b][gb:c][db:d]C[If B63 at 'a', then W 'b', B 'c' and W 'd', it would form an exchange, White will get a big corner, however after Black takes one white stone, it has no influence to White on the right side, Black can not be satisfied (see var a).];W[be];B[ce]
(;W[de]LB[ed:a][bf:b][bc:c][ae:d][bb:e][ch:f]C[W66 is an inevitable counter-attack, if White plays at 'a', then B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e' and B 'f', White can't be satisfied (see var a).];B[bc];W[fd];B[cf];W[bf];B[cg];W[bg]

;B[ho];W[cl]TR[ce][cf][cg][ch]C[W86: White has the implication of preventing the four marked black stones from moving out.];B[jn];W[lo]C[After W88, White is favorable for the game.];B[rj];W[bo]LB[jf:a][cn:b][im:c][qc:d]C[W90 is a very questionable move, White should play at 'a', which is the vital point, next if Black plays at 'b', then White can play at either 'c' or 'd', the game would be to White's advantage.]
