Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[This is the first game in the 17th Chinese Mingren title final between the current Mingren title holder Qiu Jun 7p (Black) and the challenger Gu Li 7p.];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[fc];W[cf]
;B[kc];W[po]C[W8: White elects to high-approach the corner, it is relatively intense.];B[qm]C[The tight pincer of B9 is inevitable.];W[qq];B[qp];W[pp];B[qo];W[qn];B[pn];W[rn];B[rq];W[qr]
;B[ro];W[oq];B[rm];W[on];B[pm]C[Through B23, it is a joseki, Black's configuration is good.];W[qf]LB[od:a][qi:b]C[White elects to approach from this direction, if Black protects the corner simply by playing at 'a', White will make the two-space extension at 'b', this will form another game.];B[pe]C[In the game, B25 is tight.];W[pf]C[W26 is also an inevitable move.];B[of]
;W[og];B[nf]LB[oe:a]C[The shape with B27 and B29 is a little questionable. With B27 for Black to extend at 'a' is a little better, if White also presses, Black can hane at the head, this can prevent White from attaching on the second line at any time.];W[ph]C[With the tiger's move of W30, White forms a good shape.];B[ng];W[nh];B[mh]C[Black expands his moyo with B31 and B33.];W[ni];B[fe];W[db];B[fq]LB[mi:a]C[B37: Black wants badly to press at 'a', but unluckily it is a gote move.]
;W[cn];B[iq];W[he];B[hc];W[fg];B[gf]C[White takes advantage in the exchange of W42 and B43.];W[lg]LB[le:a][gg:b]C[After W44, if Black protects the territory passively by playing at 'a', White will press at 'b', the big komi will become Black's problem.];B[mg];W[ld];B[kd]
;W[le];B[jf];W[od];B[oe];W[pc]C[W50 and W52 are good move.

After this move, it is time for noon break.];B[qc];W[lc]LB[ob:a]C[But W54 is careless, White can consider to hang at 'a', White is not bad.];B[ob];W[kb]LB[jb:a][mb:b]C[W56 again is careless, expecting Black to block at 'a', then White can hang at 'b'.]
;B[mb]C[B57: Of course, Black doesn't play as White wishes, B57 is a good move.];W[lb];B[de];W[ce];B[kf]LB[ed:a][dc:b][cd:c]C[B61: Black should hang at 'a', White needs to reinforce his big dragon with one move, next Black can atari at 'b', White can only connect at 'c', Black pushes and captures one stone, Black is already successful. In the game, Black thinks the timing is already ripe and he can make a kill.];W[lf];B[kh];W[ke]
(;B[ib]LB[jc:a][je:b][hf:c][gb:d][gc:e][ic:f][fb:g]C[B65: If Black connects with an inefficient shape at 'a', next W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 'e', W65, B 'f' and W 'g', White can manage to cross over, this way White's situation is also no good (see var a).];W[id]C[Black misses a chance, W66 is the only move and also the winning move, fully showing Gu Li's accurate calculation.];B[jc];W[kg];B[jg];W[lh]
;B[li];W[jh];B[ki];W[ig];B[je];W[jd];B[ih];W[gd]
(;B[fb]LB[jb:a][nd:b][pb:c][gc:d][gb:e][fd:f][ji:g][hd:h][ec:i][ed:j][md:k][mc:l][nc:m][ma:n][nb:o][me:p][ja:q][ka:r][dc:s][hq:t]C[B79 is the losing move. Now Black should play at 'a', next W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 'e', W 'f', B 'g', W 'h', B 'i', W 'j', B 'k', W 'l', B 'm', W 'n', B 'o', W 'p', B 'q', W 'r', B79 and W 's', if both sides continue to reduce liberties, it will lead to ko-killing and Black takes the ko first, but Black can't reinforce the ko himself, White can take tenuki at the top and attach in at 't' to make troubles, therefore the situation is still very complicated (see var a).]
