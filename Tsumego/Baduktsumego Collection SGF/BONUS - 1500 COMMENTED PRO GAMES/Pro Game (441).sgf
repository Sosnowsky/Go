Translation:GoGameWorld.];B[qd]C[The final best-of-3 series starts to play, it is a little regretful, because there is no Chinese player in the final. In the game 1, Cho Chikun's mistake comes too early.];W[dp];B[dc];W[pp];B[cn]

;B[jo]LB[lq:a]C[As to the turn and cap of B19, next for White to make one-space extension at 'a' is common.];W[dn];B[dm];W[em]C[After the diagonal's extension of B21, W22 is a normal response.];B[do]LB[co:a]C[B21 and B23 are intense counterattack, White doesn't have any ko threat on the board: before that, for White to hang at 'a' with W22 is a big crude move.];W[eo];B[en];W[cp];B[bq]

(;B[fo]LB[ep:a][dl:b][bo:c][eq:d]C[B31: The more severe play for Black is to cut and atari at 'a', then W31, B 'b', if White connects at 'c', then Black can extend at 'd' (see var a).];W[ep];B[fm];W[bo];B[gn]C[Black makes a ponnuki with B33 and B35 to form an exchange, Black becomes very thick! Besides Black's two stones in the corner still have some aji left, so Black is absolutely favorable for the game.];W[cl];B[nq]TR[jq]C[After Black approaches with B37, White can't save the marked white stone.]
;W[qf]C[However, White tenukis and forces at the top with W38, breaking away from the main battle field.];B[dr]LB[pr:a]C[With the sequence following B39, Black is trying hard to use the aji, but unexpectedly Black has built the cause of ruin! Here Black doesn't need to play, directly making the knight's move at 'a' is the proper move.];W[er];B[cq]LB[br:a][gr:b][bm:c][ck:d]C[Black's losing cause: First, with B41 Black should play at 'a', this way Black has more liberties, also Black's diagonal's extension at 'b' becomes sente, even if Black doesn't elect to play the ko by the hane at 'c', for Black to attach and seal off at 'd' instead is also very good.];W[br];B[dq]LB[fr:a][pr:b]C[The root mistakes are B41 and B43, especially B43! Black absolutely didn't expect White can play at 'a', even if Black is one step late and Black makes the knight's move at 'b', White can't prevent Black from crossing over, this way Black wouldn't be losing immediately.]
;W[fr]LB[hr:a][gq:b]C[After W44, Black already don't know whether to play at 'a' or block the crossover at 'b'.];B[pr]C[No matter how to block the crossover, Black is all painful, with B45 Black continues to march into defeat.];W[hr]C[When White attaches with W46, actually the game is already over.];B[fp];W[eq];B[id]C[From B49 to W106, the ko fight is dazzling, but in the end Black has incurred a big loss because of insufficient ko threats.];W[hd];B[jb];W[kb]
