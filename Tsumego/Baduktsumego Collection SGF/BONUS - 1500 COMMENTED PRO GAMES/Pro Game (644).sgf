Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[Lee Sedol has a very outstanding record in international tournaments, a lot of Chinese fans also are very interested in his national competitions. Now I will introduce one game between Jo HanSeung and Lee Sedol in 1st Prices Information Cup.];W[dc];B[pp];W[dp];B[ce]
;W[ci];B[kc];W[cd];B[de];W[fd];B[hc];W[gc]LB[fc:a]C[The diagonal of W12 is crude, generally White will double at 'a'. However to play this way, Lee Sedol maybe thinks Black already has B7, it is a special case.];B[hd];W[ef];B[dh];W[di];B[eh]
;W[cg];B[dd]LB[cc:a][fe:b]C[The squeeze of B19 is a good move. If White connects at 'a', Black will attach at 'b', Black is favorable in the fight.];W[ec]C[White has no choice but to retreat with W20, but after W20, the position of the earlier stone W12 is very bad.];B[cc];W[cb];B[bd];W[bb];B[fe]C[Before making life, Black first attaches with B25, it is a good move.];W[ee];B[bf]
;W[bg];B[bc];W[ge]C[If there is no exchange of B25 and W26, White definitely will not strengthen with W30 and end in gote. Through W30, Black's situation is a little better.];B[pj];W[od];B[pc]C[Black's sequence following B33 is Yoo Changhyeok's favorite local tactic, it almost becomes joseki.];W[pe];B[pg];W[qe];B[oc];W[md];B[nc]
;W[nd];B[lc];W[ng];B[qn]LB[mg:a][mf:b]C[But the play of B41 and B43 is over-steady and hardly acceptable. With B41 Black wants to attack at 'a' or 'b'.];W[jp];B[cn];W[co];B[dn];W[eo]LB[fp:a][dk:b][fk:c]C[W48: White stresses on attack. Normally if White jumps to 'a' and Black still plays at 'b', White will consider to make the knight's move at 'c'. This way White is also very smooth.]
;B[dk];W[en]C[The press of W50 is a related move of W48.];B[fk]C[But after Black jumps with B51, because Black can get help from B15 and B17, White is very difficult to attack Black.];W[ei];B[fi];W[cl];B[cq];W[dq];B[bo];W[cp];B[dl];W[bl]
;B[bm];W[fh];B[gi]C[Through B63, White's profit is not big.];W[nq]LB[mq:a]C[W64: For White to make extension at 'a' is relatively normal. In the real game, White should already have predicted the ko fight so White elects to approach the corner one line wider.];B[lq];W[lp];B[kp];W[kq];B[ko];W[lr];B[jq]
;W[mq];B[kr];W[mc];B[mb];W[iq];B[lq];W[nb];B[ob];W[kq];B[nf]C[But when Black plays the ko threat of B81, Lee Sedol dares not eliminate the ko.];W[mf]LB[jr:a][qg:b]C[W82: At any rate, White should eliminate the ko at 'a', next B82 and W 'b', this way the outcome of this game lies in the well-being of this group, White can fight.]
;B[lq];W[lb];B[na];W[kq];B[mg];W[of];B[lq];W[ej]LB[pq:a]C[The purpose of W90 is not clear, if White attaches at 'a', White already fails in the ko fight unconditionally, but it is better than the real game.];B[kq];W[pr]C[W92 and W90 doesn't have anything to do with each other, not sure what the purpose is.];B[bq]C[B93: Black is very alert, White incurs a huge loss in territory. 	After this war, the outcome of this game has already been decided.]
;W[bp];B[ap];W[ek];B[ck];W[bk];B[bj];W[cj];B[cm];W[bi];B[dr];W[er];B[cs];W[qq]
;B[nh];W[og];B[oh];W[em];B[al];W[aj];B[fq];W[fr];B[gq];W[ar];B[br];W[gr];B[hq]
;W[ir];B[ip];W[hp];B[io];W[gp];B[hr];W[es];B[ao];W[fp];B[is];W[eq];B[jr]C[Through B131, Black takes a big lead.];W[ro]
;B[rn]LB[qo:a]C[B133: Black can consider to press at 'a', Black's sequence following B133 is very steady, but Black still keeps a considerable advantage.];W[qo];B[pn];W[kd];B[jc];W[qh];B[ph];W[rf];B[qi];W[rd];B[rc];W[rh]
;B[ri];W[sc];B[sb];W[sd];B[lf];W[me];B[no];W[ji];B[pf];W[ne];B[jk];W[li];B[lk]

;B[nk];W[oi];B[ok];W[np];B[nn];W[po];B[lg];W[jf];B[se];W[re];B[pi];W[kh];B[mi]
;W[ni];B[ke];W[ld]LB[je:a]C[W186 is game-deciding move! If White blocks at 'a', White can capture three black stones in the middle, but it is not enough to turn the game around.];B[je]C[B187: Black's calculation is correct, the following is one way street up to B195.];W[jd];B[ie];W[ic];B[ib];W[id];B[he];W[jb]
;B[hg];W[qb]C[W196: White can't strike and kill Black's corner, White has to concede defeat.];B[rb])
