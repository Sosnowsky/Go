Translation: GoGameWorld.];B[qd]C[This is the first time Umezawa Yukari gets to the final of Women Strongest contest, in the game, although she has fought vigorously, but in the middle game combat, she shows the weakness of insufficient strength, resulting in a crushing defeat.];W[dd];B[fc];W[od]C[The approach of W4 is a positive play.];B[cf]

;B[oc]LB[ie:a]C[B19 is a bit slow-paced, if Black first caps at 'a', White is difficult to respond.];W[nc];B[pc];W[nd];B[qf];W[ie];B[dp];W[oq]LB[pp:a]C[W26 is ingeniously conceived good move! it is uninspired to play at the start point 'a'.];B[qp]TR[qf]LB[fi:a]C[The ensuing moves from B27 to B51 have chosen the completely wrong direction! it can be said this sequence is the losing play for the game. Because Black in the upper right is very strong with the marked stone sticking out in a low position,  so it is pointless to play on the right side, however Black has played so many moves here, it is a huge loss! B27 should knight jump to 'a', which is the vital point for both sides.]

;B[rn];W[ro];B[rm];W[qq];B[rp];W[pj];B[qk];W[nk];B[nj];W[mj];B[pi];W[io]C[Through 52, White amazingly has enclosed such an ideal and magnificent territory! thanks to B27.];B[fi]C[B53 is too late.]
;W[bo]C[Because White is already very thick, so W54 can freely dive into Black's framework.];B[cp];W[bp];B[bq];W[cl];B[cj];W[br];B[cq];W[bj];B[ci]LB[ck:a][bk:b][bi:c][cm:d]C[B63 is too slow! it is not like a pro move, it should first bump White with 'a', followed by W 'b', B 'c' and W 'd'! then Black gets sente, in the real game Black ends in gote, the situation turns even worse for Black.]
;W[cn];B[en];W[il]LB[db:a][ec:b]C[W66 and B 'a' are all good points, but B 'a' is more tasteful, so W66 should take the territory at 'b', this way is more solid.];B[dm];W[ck];B[db];W[dc];B[cb];W[gb];B[fb];W[bc]
;B[bb];W[gc];B[ac]LB[fe:a]C[Through B77, Black not only has gained a lot of territory but also leaves the possibility of attacking White's weakness at 'a'.];W[mi]LB[aq:a]C[W78 is not a simple and clear approach, it should cross over at 'a', this play itself is worth more than ten points, it also relates to thickness and thinness of both sides, its value is mammoth.];B[fe]TR[mi]C[White looks like having more stones in the center, but after being pushed and attacked by B79, the marked white stone is likely to become a dame move.];W[gf];B[ij];W[hk]
;B[hj];W[jk];B[ff];W[fg];B[gg]C[After the push and cut of B85 and B87, the situation becomes complicated.];W[gh];B[hg];W[hh];B[ig];W[ih];B[jg];W[fh];B[lg]LB[kf:a][ji:b][kd:c]C[But immediately Black plays the slow move of B95, it is the last losing move! B95 should diagonal at 'a',  making a miai of 'b' and 'c', Black will surely get either, then although Black still has a disadvantage in the game, but Black can fight.]
;W[kf]LB[gj:a]C[In the game after White first peeps at W96 with sente then gets to play at 'a',  Black's earlier push and cut become dame moves to connect her stones back, abruptly the game is practically over for Black. ];B[kg];W[he];B[ed];W[gj];B[ki];W[jj];B[ng];W[mf];B[ji];W[ii];B[nh]
