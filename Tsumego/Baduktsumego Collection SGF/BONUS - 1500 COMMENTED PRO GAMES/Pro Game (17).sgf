(;B[cn]LB[dg:a][dh:b][eg:c][eh:d][fg:e][cd:f][cj:g]C[The play of B9 is not right, it is not consistent with B7, Black should fly out at 'a', most likely followed by the sequence up to B 'g', this way Black appears very initiative (see var a).];W[df];B[oc];W[qi];B[nq];W[pn];B[pr]
;W[qq];B[kq];W[kc]C[W18: White is not necessary to anxious, by making extension at 'a' White would already open up the situation.]LB[qf:a];B[jd];W[kd];B[jf];W[ke];B[je]LB[ig:a][lg:b][kh:c]C[B23 is dull, the focal point here should be sticking the head out, so making the diagonal at 'a' is clearly one step fast, next W 'b' and B 'c', this makes a big difference from the game.]
;W[lg];B[ji]LB[jh:a][ki:b]C[B25 is farfetched, but now Black already has no other good moves, if jumping to 'a', then White will press at 'b', Black is painful.];W[jh];B[ih];W[kh];B[ii];W[lj]LB[ig:a]C[Through W30, White's pace is smooth, however how come Black overlooks the connection defect at 'a'? In just 30 moves, Black already made two major problems, now the game is clearly easier for White to play.];B[oi]C[The cap of B31 is my style, I think exchanging the extension at 'a' with W31 is unacceptable.]LB[qg:a]
;W[og]C[The attack of W32 is intense and it is a direct attack, the two moves W18 and W32 show that Gueon Hyojin is very active in this game.];B[qj]C[W33: Black is very easy to manage itself.];W[lp]C[The ladder breaker of W34 is a good move. If White tries to solve the problem locally, it is hard to find an ideal solution.];B[pj]LB[ri:a][pi:b][pk:c]C[B35: Black takes tenuki, which is correct, however this move appears heavy, playing at 'a', 'b' or 'c', Black's shape would be more resilient.];W[lq];B[no];W[nm];B[mn]
;W[mm];B[kn];W[lm]C[W40 and W42 are too damaging, Black welcomes this kind of risky investment.];B[kp];W[ph];B[qm];W[qn];B[rn];W[ro];B[rl]C[B49: Black simply creates a ko, this means White again has to risk a group to kill Black.];W[sn];B[sm]
;W[rm];B[me];W[sl];B[qg];W[ri];B[kf]C[B57: This exchange will very acceptable for Black, the earlier hidden trouble at 'a' also disappears.]LB[ig:a];W[nd]C[W58 is an asking move, White also notices she can't die easily, but is W58 working?];B[of]C[The separation move of B59 is inevitable!];W[od];B[pd];W[nc]
;B[ng];W[nh];B[nf]LB[oh:a][ob:b]C[Now Black already has two miai good points, 'a' and 'b'.];W[pc];B[ob];W[pb];B[nb];W[mb];B[qb];W[na];B[qc]
;W[oa];B[oh];W[pg];B[mi]LB[pf:a][rk:b][ni:c]C[B77 is a very simple mistake, Black should block at 'a', it is absolutely sente, White connects at 'b', then B77. Why not playing at 'a'? Because I didn't calculate precisely in the game, after B 'a' and W 'c', which side has more liberties? I could make mistakes with such a simple calculation!];W[pf];B[qf];W[pe];B[li];W[qa];B[ra]
;W[rb];B[pa];W[kk];B[ki];W[qa];B[cf]LB[cc:a][cb:b][bb:c][bc:d]C[B89: From a local point of view, the play of B89 is wrong, the common play is to attach at 'a', next 'b', 'c' or 'd', Black can also make life. In the game Black already can only ko-live.];W[cg];B[pa];W[nj]
;B[ni];W[qa];B[bc];W[cb];B[pa];W[dp];B[cp];W[qa]LB[sb:a][sa:b][rc:c]C[During the ko fight, Black is not prudent enough, Black should play atari at 'a', then W 'b', this way after winning the ko fight, Black can take at 'c', Black would be better off in the endgame.];B[de];W[ee]

(;B[bb];W[bg]LB[bh:a][be:b][ag:c][af:d]C[B103 shows Black's basic skills are not solid, White captures Black cleanly with W104. Black can only ko-live by B104, W 'a' and B 'b', W 'c' and B 'd' (see var a).];B[pa];W[do];B[co];W[qa];B[ef];W[dg];B[pa]
;W[ff]C[White strengthens with W112, White gains a huge profit in the upper left corner.];B[sb]LB[rc:a][qe:b][re:c][rf:d][eq:e]C[B113 is questionable, locally this move causes a loss of about 10 points, Black should play atari at 'a'. In the game, White is left with the push and cut endgame. Another problem of B113 is, because of the huge loss in the upper left corner, Black must use the good threats in the upper left corner by extending at 'e', obtaining the last big point on the board and continuing to fight the ko with White.];W[eq]C[W114: White starts to destroy territory, the sequence following the calm move of W112 shows Gueon Hyojin's good whole board's view and excellent control of the situation.];B[dr];W[iq];B[kr];W[io]
;B[lo];W[fp]C[Through W120, White is favorable for the game.];B[ba];W[ad];B[gq];W[er];B[hq];W[go];B[hn];W[ir];B[hp];W[ho];B[ip]
;W[em];B[fc];W[eb];B[ck];W[ds];B[br];W[dl];B[bj];W[qa]C[W140 is a "check" in fast games in order to gain time, however this move introduces a loss of 10+ points, this mistake greatly affects Gueon Hyojin's state of mind.];B[rc];W[hl];B[bd];W[ae]
;B[gk];W[gl];B[fr];W[qr];B[rk]C[When B149, White connects with the dame of W150, White must feel very painful.];W[oe];B[cs];W[es];B[jo];W[jm];B[dn];W[en];B[fb]
;W[cq]LB[ec:a][ea:b][db:c][eg:d][fh:e][dd:f][ca:g][da:h][cc:i]C[White takes a big risk to check with W158, White should reinforce at 'a', now Black is not sharp enough. If White plays hane at 'b', there already has a big loophole, next W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f', W 'a', B 'g', W 'h', and B 'i', this way White would lose the game for sure (see var a).]
(;B[cr];W[ec]C[After White strengthens with W160, White's tumult has subsided.];B[ek];W[cl];B[bl];W[jb]C[W164 is not good, playing at 'a' is better, this way the game would still to White's advantage.]LB[gd:a];B[km];W[jl];B[ge]LB[gf:a][fg:b][eg:c]C[B167 is not right, Black should clamp at 'a', next W 'b' is the original move, then Black retreats at 167, this would be very close game. When B 'a', if White hangs at 167, Black can extend out at 'c'.]
;W[gf];B[ib];W[np]LB[or:a][oq:b][pq:c][nr:d][ps:e]C[W170 is a very alert and good endgame, comparing with the simple clamp at 'a' up to 'e', it is at least one point better.]
(;B[oq]LB[op:a][mp:b][or:c][nr:d][ns:e][ms:f][os:g]C[B171 is the right move, if Black plays at 'a',  Black would incur 3-point loss, followed by W171, B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f' and W 'g' (see var a).];W[op];B[mp];W[ps];B[mr];W[or];B[fl]

;B[fa];W[hf];B[jc];W[kb]C[W194 is not good, White should play atari at 'a', W194 is 6-point endgame, the atari at 'a' is at least 5 points, and later on the aji in the corner doesn't exist any more.]LB[ie:a];B[if];W[bi];B[ci];W[di];B[cj];W[ei];B[fg];W[bm]
;B[cm]C[W202 incurs one point loss, playing the endgame normally at 'a' is very good for White, this way it is still a very close game.

In this one-move-per-30-second fast game, the second half of the game not only tests players' basic skills and also tests whether you can stay calm and cool.]LB[ns:a]
;W[im];B[ij];W[ms];B[mn]C[B269: For Black to take at 'a' is better, in the game White first destroys three points, then it is still not sure who will win the ko fight, Black makes one mistake after another, Black absolutely loses common senses.]LB[lr:a];W[ks];B[js];W[ls];B[jr];W[ns];B[lr];W[pm];B[ig]
