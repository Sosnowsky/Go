Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[Black is Gu Li 9P of China];W[dc]C[White is Hong Min Pyo 5P of Korea];B[pq]C[Nobody in the world is always invincible, even Lee Changho can lose five games in a row. Gu Li's loss to Hong Minpyo is also normal.];W[dq]
;B[ce];W[ci];B[gc];W[ed];B[jc]LB[jd:a]C[B9: For Black to play at 'a' is common, it seems Gu Li continues to study and improve this opening.];W[cd];B[pj];W[oc]LB[od:a]C[W12 aims to prevent Black from comfortably protecting the corner at 'a'.];B[mc];W[qo]
;B[qp];W[po];B[nq];W[ql];B[rk];W[co]LB[pd:a]C[W20 breaks away from the main battle field. Now the upper-right corner is focus, to play at 'a' is relatively better.];B[pc]C[B21: Black attacks first.];W[od]C[W22: White still has to handle W12 one stone and is no doubt passive.];B[pf];W[md];B[lc]
;W[of];B[og]LB[pg:a]C[B25 and B27 are not consistent, careless mistake, and this is the reason leading to Black's unfavorable opening. If Black wants to hane, Black should play hane with B25. If Black retreats with B25, Black should continue retreat at 'a' with B27. The point here is not allowing White have eye shape.];W[ng];B[nf];W[oe];B[pg];W[mg]LB[mi:a]C[After W32, Black at around 'a' is not sente, losing follow-up attack tactics.];B[rl];W[mo];B[lp]
;W[kn]LB[jp:a][nj:b]C[W34 and W36 are good moves, making 'a' and 'b' miai, White must get one. Black fails in the opening.];B[jp];W[nj];B[ol]C[B39: Black clearly has no assurance of success. However, Black is also reluctant to allow White use this area as thickness.];W[op];B[oq];W[mp];B[lq];W[nl]C[W40 and W44: White handles well.];B[nm]
;W[om];B[pm];W[on];B[nk];W[ml];B[mk];W[ok];B[pl];W[ll]C[W54 again is good calm move. Since White here is very light, only if White can connect, White will be successful.];B[nh];W[mh]LB[lh:a]C[W56 is relentless. In fact, if White plays at 'a', Black also will gain nothing.]
;B[mi];W[ni];B[mf]C[Through B59, Black captures five white stones, but White's thickness configures very well with thickness on the left side, White is still favorable for the game.];W[lf];B[lg];W[lh];B[le];W[kg];B[me];W[oh];B[oj];W[ph];B[qh]
;W[lk];B[fe];W[df];B[bd];W[bc];B[dj];W[di];B[ej];W[cj];B[ck]LB[dl:a]C[B79 is Gu Li's first-class tangling good move. If Black jumps to 'a', White will extend at 79, Black has problem with eye shape.];W[ei];B[cn]
;W[do];B[bo];W[bp];B[el];W[dn]C[W86 is a good calm move, here Black loses shape.];B[fj]LB[cm:a][bk:b]C[If B97 at 'a', W 'b', Black has no answer.];W[cm];B[bk];W[fi];B[hj]
;W[gi];B[hl];W[qi]LB[qg:a]C[When White sails smoothly, W94 is bad move! Here to cut at 'a' is beautiful tesuji! This way Black can't connect top and bottom, White will take advantage (6.5+ points), White is simply favorable.];B[qg];W[pi];B[ri]C[After B97, the situation is chaotic.];W[hq];B[ah];W[aj];B[bj];W[bi]
;B[ai];W[ag];B[bm];W[bn];B[fd];W[qj];B[rj]LB[qk:a]C[B109 is thick, but in terms of points, to play at 'a' is better.];W[fb];B[ec];W[ee];B[cb];W[cc]
;B[eb];W[db];B[fc];W[gj];B[gk];W[ik]C[W120: White has to take advantage of 5+ points by attacking in order to keep balance for the game.];B[hk];W[gm]C[White plays very well, W122 takes the vital point.];B[cl];W[fl];B[fk];W[em]C[W126: White encloses big territory instantly.]
;B[dl];W[am];B[al];W[bl];B[jk];W[jj];B[bm];W[qk];B[an]C[B135: Black perhaps should continue the ko fight, this way Black can keep advantage in territory, then bet everything on the big dragon.];W[rn];B[da];W[ff];B[iq]
;W[ir];B[hp];W[mq]C[W142 is urgent, otherwise White may lose the chance.];B[mr];W[jq]C[White avoids this trap.];B[ip]C[Since Black can't win the ko fight on the left side, Black loses for sure.];W[kr];B[lr];W[gq];B[cn];W[rp];B[rq]
