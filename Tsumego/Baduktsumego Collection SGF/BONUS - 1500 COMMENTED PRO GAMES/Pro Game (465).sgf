Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[pd]C[The common sense is, Hane Naoki's style is steadiness, but to say his moves are not powerful enough is just wrong.];W[dd];B[pq];W[cp];B[ep]
;W[qo];B[pm];W[kp];B[po];W[hp]C[W8 and W10 are interesting, never saw it before.];B[dm]C[B11 is a good move.];W[eo];B[fo];W[en];B[dp];W[cn];B[cq]
;W[co];B[fn];W[em];B[bq];W[fq]LB[fp:a]C[W22: If White continues the joseki by playing at 'a', W8 will become useless, White is not good. Therefore, White starts to vary.];B[fp];W[gq];B[dk]C[The pincer of B25 is positive.];W[fm];B[ho];W[di]C[W28 is a must, one should avoid escaping on yourself alone.]
;B[fk];W[hm];B[io];W[jp];B[kn]LB[er:a]C[B33 is a questionable move! This shape is not right and leaves a lot of hidden troubles, Black should make life at 'a'.];W[fi];B[lq]LB[hk:a]C[B35 is also a little hasty, to play at 'a' is best.];W[lp];B[mq];W[dr]C[W38 is the vital point! Black sinks into a bitter battle.]
;B[dq];W[cr];B[kr];W[ip];B[hk];W[il]LB[gk:a][jn:b]C[But W44 is a slow move! To wedge at 'a' is the strongest move, this way White can aims to crosscut at 'b', Black is difficult to handle.];B[hn];W[hi];B[ik]C[In the real game, since White's one move is slow, after B45 and B47, White has to escape out, the situation has been turned around.];W[gl]
;B[gk];W[kl];B[gn];W[hl];B[jk];W[jl];B[ln]LB[er:a][br:b]C[B55 is not careful and accurate enough, Black should first play the sente moves at 'a' and 'b'.];W[jr]LB[br:a]C[W56 is also wrong, White should play at 'a', this way Black's big group has no eyes, painful.];B[bk]LB[ji:a][kk:b]C[B57: Black makes another mistake! Now the battle field is on the right side, at any rate Black can't take tenuki! Black should play at 'a' or 'b'.]
;W[cj];B[ck];W[ml]LB[ji:a]C[After W60, Black still has to play at 'a', definitely there is no hurry to play B57, now Black's situation is not good.];B[ji];W[nn];B[nm];W[mm];B[mn];W[no];B[om]LB[nl:a][pn:b]C[B67: Black can only fight desperately by playing at 'a'. If White wedges at 'b' as in the game, Black can fight a ko with White, and treat the big dragon at the top as ko threats.]
;W[pn];B[on];W[pp];B[oo];W[mo];B[er];W[eq];B[br];W[fr];B[cs];W[es];B[bp];W[op]
;B[qq];W[qp]C[Through W82, Black's side is being pierced through, Black's situation has deteriorated.];B[or];W[nq]C[W84 should be reserved.];B[nr];W[lj]LB[ok:a]C[W86 is over steady, White should make the knight's move at 'a'.];B[oj];W[rm];B[rk];W[ql];B[pk]
;W[lo];B[gh];W[gi];B[eh];W[ei];B[cg]LB[bi:a][df:b]C[B97 is a bad move, since Black can't crossover at 'a', to strike at 'a' is just the vital point.];W[df];B[dg];W[ff];B[fh];W[hh]
;B[hg];W[jh];B[ig];W[ih];B[ki];W[mh];B[mi];W[li];B[kh];W[jg];B[lh];W[ni];B[mg]
;W[nh]LB[mj:a]C[W116: White should take at 'a', this way White's eye shape is better.];B[gf];W[je];B[gd];W[ic]LB[ph:a]C[W120 is slow! White should jump down at 'a', the top side is not difficult to handle.];B[ph]C[The value of B121 is too big! After W82, White plays so many slow moves, now several dragons tangle together, the situation is very chaotic.];W[ng];B[lf];W[mf]
;B[kf];W[jf];B[ld];W[gb];B[nj];W[mj];B[fc];W[fb];B[ec];W[dc];B[eb];W[db];B[fa]
;W[he];B[ee];W[ef];B[de]LB[ge:a][cf:b]C[B139 and B141 are good moves to fight by sacrificing! If Black simply connects at 'a', next W 'b', Black can't cross over.];W[ce];B[cf];W[fe];B[ge];W[gc];B[hd];W[id]LB[ke:a][kc:b][bi:c][mb:d]C[W148 is a bad move! White should push at 'a', then jumps to 'b', this way when B 'c', White can make the knight's move at 'd', this is much better than the real game.]
;B[hc];W[hb];B[fd];W[ed];B[bi];W[bj];B[aj];W[kc];B[lc];W[lb];B[mb];W[jb];B[pf]C[When B161, the situation already has been turned around unconsciously.]
;W[gp]C[Since White's big dragon is not alive, the tactic of W162 is not working, but it is very regrettable that Wang Yao misses an excellent chance under time pressure!];B[bo]LB[am:a][bm:b][bn:c][ao:d][al:e][an:f]C[B163 is a pitiful losing move! Now Black can save several stones by making the clever knight's move at 'a'! This way Black will win the game. Next if W 'b', then B163, W 'c' and B 'd', both sides are safe; When B163, if W 'e', then B 'c' and W 'e', although Black's big group in the upper-left corner will be captured, but White's big dragon in the center will also be killed.];W[bn];B[jn]LB[ao:a][al:b]C[B165: Black seeks a way of conceding defeat, if B 'a', then W 'b', Black is also not good.]
