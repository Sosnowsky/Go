Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[Ok deukjin 2p is not a famous player, but because he defeated some top players and obtained the right to challenge, people start to pay attention to him. Unexpectedly in the final game 1 he captured Lee Changho's big dragon and won that game. Therefore, this game 2 also becomes an important match.];W[pp];B[dc];W[cp];B[ep]

;B[br];W[bo];B[gr];W[fr];B[hr];W[dr];B[cn];W[go]LB[hp:a]C[The variations of "the large avalanche" in the lower left corner are too many, new trend keeps coming, with W26, the earlier move was to connect at 'a', and now it was changed to the extension as in this game.];B[en];W[iq];B[ir];W[jq]
;B[ar];W[jr];B[es];W[is];B[ck]C[Through B35, the local exchange comes to an end, as to this result, we probably can say that they have made compromise.];W[qn]C[W36: White forms a good shape.];B[ce]LB[od:a][mc:b]C[B37 is Lee Changho's unique thinking. The common move is to protect the corner at around 'a'. With this move, Black perhaps tries to entice White to approach the corner at 'a', then Black can pincer at 'b'.];W[od]LB[kc:a][re:b]C[W38: White can consider to split at 'a'. White's play in the game is territory-damaging, and White doesn't seal off with W 'b', it is also not good to form territory on the side.]

;W[om];B[ph]C[From B49 to B53, White already has no follow-up tactic.];W[re]C[The play of W54 should be reserved.];B[rg];W[kc];B[hd];W[je]LB[bn:a][bm:b][fm:c]C[W56 and W58 are also not good, White should crawl at 'a' to probe Black, if Black retreats, later on there will be a multi-stage ko; If Black plays hane at 'b', White can make the knight's move at 'c', aiming at Black's cut point, Black is a little difficult.];B[gm]C[B59 is a good point.]
;W[rb];B[qb];W[hl];B[ho]C[B63 is a wonderful move! White has no good answer.];W[in];B[hp];W[gs];B[gn];W[hs];B[im];W[hm]LB[jm:a][il:b]C[W70: White wants to counter-hane at 'a', but after Black extends at 'b', White surprisingly is not favorable in the ladder.]
;B[hn];W[jn];B[qq]C[Next B69 and B73 leave some aji.];W[or];B[hk]C[The hit of B75 becomes effective.

After this move, it is time for lunch break.];W[il];B[gl];W[cf];B[df];W[ik];B[jo]C[B81 is a sequence play.];W[ko]LB[hj:a]C[But with W82, White can only counterattack by playing atari at 'a'.]

;W[kj];B[gd];W[hh];B[ol]C[In the real game, Black extends with B83, turns with B91 and attaches with B99, the game completely enters into Lee Changho's tempo.];W[nl]LB[pm:a]C[The block of W100 is far-fetched, White can only retreat at 'a'.];B[pr];W[rp];B[oq];W[nr];B[kn];W[km]
;B[qp];W[qo];B[pm]LB[on:a]C[Through B109, White is already desperate.];W[op]LB[on:a][rq:b][nq:c][po:d]C[W110: If White retreats at 'a', B 'b' is sente, next simply press at 'c', capture one stone at 'd' to make life. In the game, Black gets inside in sente, it also means White is sentenced to death penalty.];B[on];W[nm];B[pn]
;W[rq];B[kp];W[ln];B[ih];W[sd];B[kd];W[jd];B[kb];W[jb];B[lc];W[jc];B[if]LB[ie:a]C[Black's sequence from B119 to B125 is strong. If White pushes at 'a', White's several stones in the back will be captured, in the real game, after the exchange, White also will lose by a big margin.]
