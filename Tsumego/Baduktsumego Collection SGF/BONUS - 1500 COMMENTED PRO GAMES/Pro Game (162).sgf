Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[pd]C[The series is tied at 1:1 in the first two games, finally comes the decisive game 3. In terms of first two games contents, generally people think Luo Xihe has a chance to win the champion.

In this game, Luo Xihe plays brilliantly, finally defeated Lee Changho by 2:1 and won the champion. This world champion is well deserved, Luo Xihe, congratulations!];W[dd];B[qp];W[dp];B[fq]
;W[hq];B[oq];W[cn];B[fc];W[cf];B[db]C[The opening up to B11 is same as game 1.];W[hc]C[W12: White starts to vary.];B[cc];W[ec];B[eb];W[fd];B[gd]
;W[gc];B[fb];W[ge]C[In the joseki up to W20, White is favorable in the ladder, this is also the reason why Lee Changho elects to play W12.];B[dr];W[eq]C[W22: White again elects to take outside influence, the game forms a situation of White's outside thickness vs. Black's territory.];B[er];W[fp];B[gq];W[gp];B[hr];W[ir];B[cp]
;W[co];B[dq]C[The atari of B31 is a crude move and should be reserved.];W[ep];B[bp];W[bd];B[bc];W[gr];B[fr];W[hs];B[dj]C[The invasion of B39 is in time.];W[br];B[bq]
;W[bo];B[ar];W[ej]LB[fj:a][cl:b]C[White's attack with W44 is surprising. White can consider to cap at 'a' or jump to 'b', this is all better than the real game.];B[dk];W[ek];B[cl];W[el];B[ch]C[B47 and B49 are good moves, Black simply makes life. White fails in the attack.];W[di];B[ci]
;W[nc];B[qf];W[ne];B[ei];W[dh];B[dg];W[eh];B[cg];W[eg];B[df];W[cd];B[mg]C[After Black makes life on the left side, the ladder breaker of B17 still exists. B63 is a good move.];W[hd]
;B[ee];W[ed];B[og]C[After Black connects back with B67, Black enters into the center smoothly, Black is simply favorable for the game.];W[pl];B[oc];W[nb];B[pj];W[qn];B[lf];W[kd];B[ro];W[nk];B[nn]
;W[mq];B[ol]C[The attack of B75 and B79 is Luo Xihe's style. Although Black also has many choices, but the set pattern in the real game is the most clear and simple one.];W[om];B[nl];W[nm];B[mm];W[ok];B[ml];W[pk];B[pm];W[qm];B[on];W[qj]
;B[qi];W[pi];B[rj];W[oj];B[qh];W[rk];B[kp]C[B97 is a good point.];W[kq]LB[lp:a]C[W98: White can't counterattack at 'a'.];B[lp];W[lq];B[ob]C[The block of B101 is very big. It seems Black's advantage is huge, White needs to form a big territory in order to keep balance in territory, and in fact it is difficult.]
;W[ac];B[bb];W[bm];B[bl];W[dl];B[bf];W[km];B[ln]C[B109 is steady, here Black needs to spend some time and play more positively.];W[jn];B[ip];W[ho];B[jj];W[ij]C[W114 is game-deciding move.]
;B[ii];W[ji]C[After White cuts with W116, temporarily Black is difficult to find a sure-winning settle pattern.];B[ld]C[B117 is Luo Xihe feint-attack tactic.];W[lc];B[kc];W[pe];B[qe];W[od];B[pc];W[le];B[ke];W[md]
;B[jd];W[ld]C[After White connects with W128, although Black looks favorable, but since White is good at ko threats, Black also needs to be very careful.];B[fi];W[gh];B[jh];W[ki];B[hi]C[B133 is a relatively simple play.];W[ik];B[gi];W[ff];B[ig];W[kf]
;B[kh]LB[je:a]C[But the press of B139 is slow, if Black connects at 'a', the capturing race is a little complicated, but it is working for Black. This way Black is winning.];W[je]C[After White captures one stone, White gains some territory and already catches up with Black in territory.];B[li];W[kj];B[lj];W[kk];B[gk];W[gl];B[ri];W[oh];B[nr]
;W[pg]C[When W150, the game is already close and slightly to White's advantage.];B[lk];W[ll];B[mk];W[qd]C[Following W154, White starts to exploit Black, Black already has no way to retreat.];B[pf];W[of];B[oe];W[cj];B[ck];W[pe];B[qc]
;W[rd];B[oe];W[bj];B[bi];W[pe];B[qg];W[rc];B[rb];W[qb]LB[pa:a][oa:b]C[The cut of B170 is not simple and clear, this is the reason whey the game is being turned around again. White should strike at 'a', then B 'b', if entering the endgame this way, White will win the game by a small margin.];B[qa];W[ra]C[White's sequence following W172 is clever.]
;B[sa];W[sb];B[sc];W[sd];B[pb];W[sb];B[oe];W[ra];B[nf];W[qb]C[Through W182, it forms a ko, the first feeling is, White's play is indeed very severe.];B[ni];W[oi];B[rb]
;W[af];B[be];W[qb];B[io]C[But following B189, Black finds ko threat very cleverly, it is the bright point of this game. Black unexpectedly makes six ko threats in the center and also takes endgame advantage. White surprisingly can't win this ko fight.];W[in];B[rb];W[ab];B[gb];W[hb];B[ae];W[qb];B[hn];W[hp]

;B[rb];W[op]C[W242, W272 and W278 are all very damaging ko threats.];B[np];W[qb];B[na]C[Finally Black gives up the ko fight, Black already has enough. 
So far, Black wins the game for sure.];W[pa];B[la];W[kb];B[gm];W[qa];B[oa];W[gn]
