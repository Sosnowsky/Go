Edited and translated by GoGameWordld.com.];B[pd]C[In the final game 3 of the 48th Korean Guksu title, Lee Changho lost to Choi Cheolhan again. Lee Changho's White is favorable for most part of the game, but Lee Changho fails to keep his advantage to the end, and this is originally what he was good at.];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[fq];W[hq]
;B[qo];W[kq];B[cq];W[dq];B[cp];W[do];B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[eq];B[cn]C[The opening up to B17 is exactly same as that in the game 1.];W[nc]LB[fc:a]C[W18 starts to vary, in the game 1, White makes the small knight's move at 'a'.]
;B[qf];W[pb];B[qc];W[kc];B[cf];W[fd];B[bd];W[cc];B[dh];W[em];B[mq];W[ne];B[lo]LB[pj:a]C[The purpose of B31 is to control the center, the common move is to make an extension at 'a'.]
;W[qp]C[W32 is an asking move.];B[rp]LB[qq:a][pk:b]C[B33: If Black answers at 'a', White's splitting move can be played at 'b'.];W[pj];B[jp];W[jq];B[pl];W[po]LB[ro:a]C[W38: White again probes Black, Black can kill White cleanly only if Black connects at 'a', but Black's aji is no good.];B[qn]C[In the real game, Black retreats with B39, White is left with the tactic of living in the center, White can be satisfied.]
;W[qq];B[pp];W[rq];B[ro];W[qh];B[of];W[pr];B[or];W[qs];B[np];W[rr]C[W50: White makes life in the corner, it is practical. Black appears a little over-concentrated.];B[ip];W[iq]
;B[nk];W[nj];B[mj];W[ni];B[mi]LB[mk:a]C[The press of B57 is over-strong, the original move is to connect at 'a'.];W[ok];B[ol];W[mk];B[nl];W[mh];B[lh];W[li]C[White ataris out with W64, Black's shape is more and more duplicated.]
;B[lj];W[ki];B[mg];W[nh];B[kh];W[ji];B[lk];W[ng]C[Through W72, it seems Black already has no good move to play in the center.];B[gd]C[B73: Black can only start to seek a way of playing at the top.];W[ge];B[hd];W[he]
;B[jd];W[ie];B[fc];W[id]LB[ec:a]C[The first feeling of W80 is to block at 'a', it seems Black also doesn't have any good follow-up. Lee Changho must be wondering: what Choi Cheolhan is trying to do? In the game, White elects to play a simple and clear move of W80.];B[nf]C[Black again tries to seek a way of playing by pushing with B81.];W[mf];B[me];W[lf]LB[lg:a][kg:b]C[W84: White can also consider to take at 'a', next B84 and W 'b', Black doesn't have any good way to borrow strength.];B[le]
;W[ke];B[kf];W[lg];B[kg];W[mg];B[jc]C[Black gets to push with B91, it is very important.];W[je];B[ed];W[fe];B[ic];W[ec];B[eb];W[ee]
;B[gb]C[Through B99, Black lives one group, it can be said that Choi Cheolhan has avoided a crisis.];W[cm];B[dn];W[en];B[bn];W[ch]C[The attachment of W104 is a good move locally.];B[ci];W[cg];B[dg];W[bi];B[bj];W[bf]
;B[dj];W[df]C[Through W122, White obtains some territory, the whole game is still to White's advantage.];B[fo];W[eo];B[fr];W[fs];B[hp];W[gp]LB[gr:a]C[W118: If White crosses over at 'a', both sides would be safe and steady, but White aims to achieve high efficiency, therefore a fight comes again.];B[fp];W[go];B[gs]
;W[es];B[fn];W[gq]LB[hm:a][gn:b][hn:c][fl:d][gl:e][gr:f]C[In the capturing race, W124 is a mistake and the losing move of this game. White should make the knight's move at 'a', next B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W24, B 'e' and W 'f', this way White is still favorable for the game.];B[gn];W[hn];B[hm];W[gr]
;B[ho]C[B129 is a strong move.];W[in];B[im];W[jn];B[ko];W[jm];B[jk]C[Through B135, White sinks into a difficult situation.];W[ik]C[With the sequence following W136, although White escapes four stones, but White's big dragon suddenly dies, the game is over.];B[jl];W[ll];B[kk];W[gm]
