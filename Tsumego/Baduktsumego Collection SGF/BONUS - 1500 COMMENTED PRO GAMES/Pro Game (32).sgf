Copyright by gogameworld.com and weiqi.tom.com.];B[qd]C[An DalHoon is one of Korean very strong and young players, although he is not very famous, but he once beat many Chinese high hands, today as to Zhou Heyang, this game is perhaps relatively harder than the game yesterday.];W[pp];B[dc];W[cp];B[eq]C[Through B5, the opening is same as yesterday's game.]
;W[de]C[W6: Zhou Heyang first starts to vary.];B[ce];W[dd];B[cd];W[ec];B[cc]LB[nc:a]C[B11 is simple and clear, Black didn't elect to play the popular complicated "large avalanche" joseki, perhaps Black saw the good point at 'a' to protect the corner.];W[df];B[nc];W[cf];B[eb];W[fc]
;B[fb];W[gp]LB[hc:a][do:b][hq:c]TR[nc]C[W18 taking tenuki is also inevitable, the normal play is to jump at 'a', but due to the existence of the marked black stone, White already is reluctant to play at this area.

Liu Xing: White is alert, but White's play in the lower left is a little inappropriate, making the diagonal at 'b' is the simplest play, next the jump at 'a' and the pincer at 'c' become miai, White must get one, this way White's opening is smooth.];B[cm];W[ep]C[W20: When Black counter-pincers with B19, White dare not counterattack.];B[cj];W[hc];B[dq];W[dp]
;B[gq]C[After Black makes the extension of B21 in sente, Black gets to live the corner with B23 and B25, Black's tempo is smooth.];W[hq];B[fq];W[hp];B[cq];W[bo];B[bq];W[np];B[pj]LB[ej:a][fp:b][fe:c]C[Through B33, it seems Black sails freely at a full speed.

Liu Xing: Black takes a big point with B33, it seems there is nothing to blame, but in this situation it is a losing move in the opening! Now jumping at 'a' is imperative, strengthening Black himself and also aiming at the push and cut in the lower left at 'b' and also striking at 'c'. One single move can serve three purposes, Black unexpectedly ignores it!]
;W[ej]C[Liu Xing: Black is very happy with the cap of W34! Black's two-space extension on the left suddenly seems very restricted.];B[em]LB[el:a][ch:b][eh:c][dl:d]C[B35: If I were Black, I will make the small knight's move at 'a'.

Liu Xing: Black's sequence from B35 to B39 again is low efficient and only helps White to reinforce, at least Black should play one-space extension at 'b', next W 'c' and B 'd'.];W[fp]C[In the real game, after White calmly reinforces with the connection of W36, Black itself appears a little thin.];B[ch]C[At any rate, B37 doesn't seem to be a good move, although there are a lot of choices in this area, but one-space extension seems somewhat insipid.];W[eh];B[dk]LB[fe:a]C[B39: Black is put to great inconvenience, since the situation is already like this, I think, Black should take tenuki and continue to grab the big point on the right side. If knowing this earlier, with B33 for Black to jump at 34 is better, if White plays at 33, Black can play at 'a' at the top to press White, Black can also push and cut at 36, Black can adequately fight.]
;W[ql]C[Through W40, the situation has been turned around, now White is favorable in the game.

Liu Xing: White is able to obtain sente and grab the extension of W40, Black's opening completely fails.
];B[qq]LB[id:a]C[B41 entering the corner is too early, Black should play on the upper side at around 'a'.];W[qp];B[pr];W[pq];B[lq]C[B45 is more inexplicable, since Black already has entered the corner, now Black can only make life first.

Liu Xing: After entering the corner with B41, then Black invades with B45, Black's play is inconsistent and chaotic.];W[or]C[The block of W46 is inevitable.];B[nr];W[qr];B[oq]C[B47 and B49 are bad and crude moves.]
;W[ps];B[jq]LB[ko:a]C[B51 again charges towards White's "iron head", the general feeling is to make the knight's move at 'a', the play in the game seems amateurish.];W[bm]C[W52 is a clever move, this move looks common but shows Zhou Heyang's prudent style.

Liu Xing: W52 is good timing.];B[bl]LB[cn:a]C[B53: I think at any rate Black should counterattack at 'a', even if this exchange is also to White's advantage.];W[cn];B[dm]C[After White exchanges W52 and W54 with Black, White's several stones already have no hidden worry.];W[kp]C[In the real game, after White settles down in sente, White happily delivers the killing move of W56, as far as their performance is concerned today, I feel there already has no big suspense in this game.

Liu Xing: White is very happy!];B[jp]
;W[jo];B[io];W[jn];B[ip];W[in];B[ho];W[gn]C[Liu Xing: White nets with W64 and puts Black into a desperate situation.];B[mp];W[mo];B[lo];W[lp];B[mq];W[ko]
;B[ir];W[hr];B[hn];W[hm];B[gm];W[is]C[Liu Xing: W76 is a clever move, if Black connects at 'a' tenaciously, then White will atari at 'b', Black is no good in the capturing race.]LB[kq:a][jr:b];B[im];W[hl];B[ln];W[jm];B[js]C[Liu Xing: Black has to retreat with B81, White obtains the sente move at 'a'.]LB[go:a]
;W[fm]C[Liu Xing: White takes the opportunity to atari out with W82, so far the game already has no suspense.];B[no];W[mn];B[hs]C[After experiencing a lot of struggle, finally Black makes life at the bottom.];W[gl]C[After White takes with W86, the big center becomes White's moyo territory, White scores big in the fight over here, and Black on the left side is still not completely alive yet, White still can exploit some points at the bottom, so far White achieves a big advantage. In the process, B77 and B79 are also crude moves and should be reserved, Black should simply block at 81, it seems today An DalHoon is very nervous and didn't give a play to his talent.];B[pl];W[qk];B[pk];W[qi]C[Liu Xing: W90 is a good move! It fully utilizes White's power of thickness on the left side. Now Black is very difficult.];B[qj];W[rj]

In the game, after W132, White already can't make the diagonal at 'a', otherwise Black will wrap at 'e', if White doesn't make the diagonal at 'a' and cuts at 'd' instead, then B 'e', W 'f', B 'g', W 'h' and B 'a', White gains nothing, the difference between W132 and a move 'a' is huge difference.];B[al]

Liu Xing: If Black connects at 'b', then White will hane at 'a', it leads to ko-killing. In the game, although Black can live after hane and connect, but White can jump in at 'c', Black rather die than live and can't continue the game any more.]
;W[ae];B[ag];W[be]C[After White connects with W160, Black still no longer can continue to play. Although W132 is a little damaging, but White's earlier advantage is too big.

The game 4 will take place on 10/15.])
