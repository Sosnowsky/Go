Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[In the second round of the 19th Tianyuan Title, Hu Yaoyu 7p took Black and defeated Luo Xihe 9p and advanced to the next round. The interesting thing about this game is, Luo Xihe whose calculation is always accurate suddenly dies in the game.];W[dc];B[pq];W[dp];B[ce]
;W[ed];B[nc];W[qn];B[ql]LB[qp:a][qk:b][ci:c]C[B9: Black can also consider to make the diagonal in the corner at 'a'. If White makes the two-space extension at 'b', then Black makes the three-space extension at 'c', this is the most common sequence.];W[qq];B[qp];W[pp];B[rq];W[qr];B[po]
;W[op];B[qo];W[rr];B[no];W[oo];B[on];W[oq];B[pn]C[Through B23, Black takes outside influence in this joseki, which makes the diagonal of W6 just the right move.
];W[df]LB[jd:a]C[W24: In this situation, White can elect to extend at 'a' directly, because with B25 Black may take tenuki to make the extension at around 'a'. In the game Black answers, White has nothing to complain.];B[cg];W[jd]
;B[dg];W[eg];B[eh];W[fh];B[ef];W[fg];B[de]LB[ei:a]C[Black takes one stone with B31 and B33, but this is not necessarily to Black's advantage, for Black to simply extend at 'a' is still better.];W[ff]LB[ee:a][lc:b]C[But W34 is a wrong move, White should atari at 'a', White would be much thicker this way, and White is in no hurry to make the extension at 'b'.];B[ee]
;W[fe];B[ei];W[fi];B[ek]LB[ej:a]C[The jump of B39 is a mistake, to extend at 'a' is the right move.];W[lc];B[cn];W[ej]LB[co:a][dn:b]C[But the wedge of W42 is wrong order, White should first make the diagonal hit at 'a', after Black extends at 'b', then White can wedge at 42, and this is just the right sequence.];B[dj];W[fj]
;B[dl];W[co]LB[bn:a]C[In the game, White first plays wedge then make the diagonal extension at 46, Black certainly will descend at 'a', this makes a big difference in points.];B[bn];W[gq];B[cc];W[cb];B[bb];W[bc];B[cd];W[db];B[cq]C[B55 entering the corner to take territory is very big. Because White is very thick on the board, Black on the right is already not easy to handle, so Black simply takes tenuki, allowing White to strike first, this is also a clever strategy.]
;W[dq];B[bp];W[nn];B[mo];W[nm]C[It is hard to judge whether W58 and W60 are good or bad moves.];B[hp]LB[iq:a]C[But the shoulder-hit of B61 is definitely a slow move, Black should force White at 'a'.];W[hq];B[jp];W[ip];B[io];W[iq]
;B[lm];W[rd]TR[nn][nm]C[W68: White doesn't elect to escape the marked two stones but open another battle field instead, this fits Luo Xihe's light and nimble style.];B[qe];W[qc]LB[re:a][qf:b][pc:c][qb:d]C[W70 again is wrong order. White certainly should crawl at 'a' first, next B 'b', W70, B 'c' and W 'd', White makes life, this is clearly better than the real game.];B[pc];W[re];B[qb]C[After Black ataris with B73 in sente, White can only crawl on the second line to make life.]
;W[rc];B[qf];W[rf];B[qg];W[rg];B[qh];W[rh];B[ri];W[rb];B[mj]C[Through B83, Black establishes his superiority.];W[mh];B[lb];W[kc]
;B[me];W[pb];B[ob];W[qi]TR[nn][nm]C[With the sequence following W90, White saves the marked two stones by using Black's thinness, White gains some profit.];B[pi];W[qj];B[rj];W[pj];B[oj];W[oi];B[pk]

;W[ki]C[After White delivers the clever clamp of W116, Black can only capture one stone W100, after White seals off, Black is very painful, the situation becomes closer.];B[kl];W[jj];B[lk];W[lj];B[ke];W[li];B[ll];W[md];B[ne];W[pd]LB[lg:a]C[The atari of W126 is indeed hard to understand and it is the losing move of this game. With W126 White should strengthen the cut at 'a', this way it will be still a long game.]
;B[lh]C[In the game, Black cuts and kills Black's stones in the center with B127, the game is also over, this should be regarded as sudden death.];W[nd];B[mg];W[oc];B[je];W[pf];B[pg];W[ie];B[if];W[kg];B[nh];W[hf];B[kh]
