;B[mc];W[qc];B[rc];W[pc];B[qg];W[me];B[md];W[rb];B[ne];W[re];B[oe]C[So far, the variation in the upper right corner is the same as that in the game I played with Seo Bongsoo recently.];W[rd]C[I like White's shape, relatively thick.]
;B[db]LB[dp:a]C[The knight move of B19 looks slow. Black should take the empty corner at 'a', this way the speed is fast.];W[dp];B[cc];W[ge]C[W22 is good point.];B[gd];W[he];B[fe];W[ff];B[gf]C[B23, B25 and B27: Black seeks a chance to fight.];W[hd]LB[fg:a]C[W28: White can also simply extend at 'a', but in the game White has follow-up tactics after W28.]
;B[gg];W[fg];B[gh];W[fb]C[W32 is tesuji, and also the reason of playing W28.];B[ec]LB[gb:a][eb:b][fd:c]C[B33: Black has no choice. If Black hangs at 'a', then W33, B 'b' and W 'c', White can capture B25 and connect together, Black is not good.];W[gc];B[fd];W[hc];B[be]
;W[di];B[cf];W[cg];B[bg];W[ce];B[bf];W[le]C[W44 is good point.];B[pd];W[oc]LB[kc:a][ch:b]C[W46: White can also consider to make knight at 'a', next W46 and W 'b', this way White is favorable.];B[je]C[The counterattack of B47 is inevitable, the situation is a little complicated.]
;W[if]LB[ld:a]C[W48: For White to turn at 'a' is the original shape.];B[jf];W[kd]C[W48 and W50 are not good.];B[jd];W[kc];B[jc];W[jb];B[ib];W[lb]C[Through W56, White also crosses over, but it damages White's eye space on the other side.];B[ja];W[kb]
;B[ic];W[ig];B[jg];W[ih];B[mg];W[lg];B[lh];W[nf]LB[nd:a]C[W64 and W66 are sharp!

If White cuts at 'a', Black will all become light.];B[gj];W[ij];B[eh];W[dl]
;B[dh];W[oh]C[W70: White grabs the knight of W72 by sacrificing and still keeps balance of the situation.];B[jh];W[ji];B[ki];W[jk];B[mf];W[lf];B[mh];W[og];B[pi];W[oi];B[oj]
;W[pj];B[nj];W[qi];B[ph];W[pg];B[nd]LB[mb:a][qh:b][qj:c][qf:d][pf:e]C[Next White should simply crossover at 'a', next B 'b', W 'c', B 'd' and W 'e', this way Black can also escape partially, but on the outside White adds W 'c' and becomes much thicker, this is clearly better than the real game.];W[pe]C[The play of W90 is inexplicable!];B[of]
;W[pf];B[ng];W[mb];B[pk];W[qh];B[qk];W[mp];B[po];W[jp];B[cq]C[Through B101, the situation is close.];W[dq];B[cp];W[co]
;B[bo];W[cn];B[bn]LB[dr:a]C[B107: Black should first play hane-and-connect at 'a', then crawl at 107.];W[dr]C[The descent of W108 is good move.];B[cm];W[dm];B[cl];W[dk]C[Black's two groups on the left and right side seem to fight with each other.];B[gm];W[ch]C[Following W114, White exploits Black very happily.]
;B[ei];W[br];B[bk];W[bj];B[bi];W[ck];B[bl];W[ci];B[dg];W[bh];B[bq];W[ho]LB[ml:a]C[But W126 enclosing territory is slow. White should make knight at 'a', reinforcing himself and also aiming at Black's weak point. This way White's situation is optimistic.]
;B[kp]C[B127 is good move!];W[ko];B[kq];W[qp];B[pp];W[jq];B[jr];W[lo];B[iq];W[ip];B[hq];W[kr];B[lr]
;W[ir];B[ks];W[hr]C[Through W142, Black gains a big profit and the situation has been turned around.];B[nq]TR[gm]LB[hl:a][gq:b][jo:c]C[But next Black immediately releases the losing move of B143, it is too slow! Black obviously overlooks the danger of B113 (the marked stone).

Black should first make knight at 'a', this way White's big group looks thin, and also Black has the tactic at 'b' and 'c', Black is favorable.];W[gl]TR[gm]C[After W144, White separates B113 (the marked stone), Black is difficult to give komi.];B[hk];W[hl]
