Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[The game between these two young and talented players draws a lot of attention.];W[dd]C[However, in this game Zhou Ruiyang's play (Black) is clearly better than Chen Yaoye.];B[fc];W[cf];B[pp]
;W[dq];B[kc];W[qj]LB[qm:a][pi:b]C[Next B9 at 'a' or 'b' is common.];B[qh]C[The opening from B1 to B9 is Zhou's favorite, he studied this opening very deeply.];W[qn];B[nq];W[rp];B[ql];W[on];B[pk]
;W[qq];B[kq];W[od]LB[pj:a]C[W18: White can also pull out right away at 'a'. However, it is said that Zhou has his own special study, let's see.];B[pf];W[qc];B[rc];W[pc];B[rb];W[mc];B[nf];W[me];B[ne]
;W[nd];B[ld];W[kb];B[jb];W[lb]C[The sequence from B19 to B33 is joseki, both sides are acceptable.];B[id]LB[ic:a]C[B33 is thoughtful move, to play at 'a' is common.];W[md];B[cn];W[cp];B[dj]LB[ic:a][jd:b][cl:c][dl:d][dk:e]C[B37: Now we can see the cleverness of B33, if B33 at 'a', then White can play ladder breaker in sente at 'b'. On the left side, White invades at 'c', next B 'd', and White's wedge at 'e' is very severe.]
;W[or]LB[gq:a][cl:b]C[W38 is one of reasons why White falls behind in the opening. For White to play at 'a' and aim to invade at 'b' is relatively better.];B[gp]C[B39 is good point.];W[eo];B[en];W[fo];B[db];W[ch];B[ci];W[dh];B[fq]
;W[do];B[cl]C[Through B49, Black takes territory in sente everywhere, Black's efficiency is extremely high, but White gains very little and incurs loss.];W[ph];B[qg];W[cc];B[oq]LB[nr:a]C[B53 is relentless, the original move is to block at 'a'. If White can't find a way to counterattack, Black's efficiency is super high.];W[ip]LB[lq:a]C[W54 is not very severe, White should attach at 'a', there will be more variations.];B[iq];W[lq]
;B[jp]LB[hq:a]C[B57 is calm, White can play hane at 'a', Black dares not act carelessly.];W[lp];B[qp];W[rq];B[nn]C[B61 is tight and good move, it just negates the killing move of W54.];W[no]C[W62: If White retreats, Black obviously will take advantage.];B[oo];W[mn];B[nm];W[np];B[pn]
;W[op];B[om];W[qo];B[po];W[pq]C[Locally White's counterattack is successful.];B[qm]TR[qj]C[But Black reinforces with B73, W8 (the marked stone) loses room for maneuver. For the whole game, Black is favorable.];W[mh];B[mf];W[kh];B[er];W[dr]
;B[bo]C[Black is very happy to take endgame advantage in sente with B77 and B79.];W[bp];B[ni];W[nh];B[oi];W[rm];B[rl];W[ib]TR[cc]C[W86 is game-deciding move, White aims at this tactic when play W52 (the marked stone).];B[ja];W[ec];B[fb]LB[eb:a]C[B89 is loose, either way Black can't ensure side territory. To make life, for Black to block at 'a' is better.]
;W[gd]LB[ic:a][jc:b][hd:c]C[W90 is strong move to destroy territory. Zhou maybe have overlooked this move (If W90 at 'a', then B 'b', W 'c' and B90, Black can kill White).];B[fd];W[ic];B[jc];W[hd];B[ie];W[hf];B[if];W[gf];B[ia]
;W[ig];B[cb];W[bc];B[le];W[hc];B[ha]C[B105: Black connects with dame, White scores in this fight.];W[qb]LB[ej:a]C[W106 is losing move, its value is not big, to reinforce the center is the right choice. If White plays at 'a', the game will be much closer.];B[pd];W[ob];B[jg]C[B109 is sharp! Since Black is thick in the center, Black will gain profit by separating White.];W[jh]
;B[ih];W[hg];B[lg];W[lh];B[ii];W[kg];B[jf];W[jj];B[gh];W[ik];B[gj];W[hl]LB[ej:a]C[W122: For White to play at 'a' is better.]
;B[ff];W[fg];B[ji];W[lj];B[ef];W[gg];B[ij];W[jk];B[bg]C[After the preparation from B123 to B129, Black shows the killing move of B131!];W[bh];B[dg]LB[cg:a][eh:b]C[If W134 at 'a', Black can kill White at 'b'.]
;W[eg];B[df];W[ei];B[cg];W[ej];B[el];W[fk]C[White seeks life by giving up "his arm".];B[ag]C[However, Black's corner is very big, the game already has no suspense.];W[bj];B[bi];W[cj];B[di]
