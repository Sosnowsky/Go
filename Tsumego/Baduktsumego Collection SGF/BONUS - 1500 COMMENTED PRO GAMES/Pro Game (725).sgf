;W[od];B[oe];W[ne];B[pe];W[ee];B[ef];W[ed];B[nd];W[df];B[md];W[dg]C[In the opening up to W16, both sides play on their own, the set pattern in two corners is exactly same, it is very rare.];B[jc];W[cn]LB[qk:a]C[W18: White can consider to split at 'a', in big-komi games, White should break up the situation very early on.]
;B[pj]C[After Black connects together with B19, Black's situation is very magnificent.];W[nq];B[lq];W[qn]LB[qq:a][qp:b]C[W22: By joseki, White will enter the corner at 'a', Black will block at 'b', this way Black's configuration is excellent.

In the real game, White aims to disrupt Black's tempo.];B[qq]C[The counterattack of B23 is correct. It seems Black will be favorable in the fight.];W[lp]LB[ql:a][qk:b][oo:c]C[W24: For White to make one-space extension at 'a' is common, next B 'b' and W 'c', however, this way White is also a little far-fetched in the fight.]
;B[kp];W[mp];B[on];W[kq];B[jq];W[kr];B[jp];W[jr];B[ir];W[lr];B[qk]C[The result through B35 is to Black's favor.];W[hq];B[mm]LB[lm:a]C[B37 is questionable. Black should make extension one-space wider at 'a', this way White can't conduct a territory race with Black.]
;W[lm]C[The attachment of W38 is a good move.];B[ll];W[kl];B[lk];W[km];B[jj];W[mn];B[nm];W[hk]C[Through W46, both sides enclose their own territory, the situation is chaotic.];B[dm];W[dn];B[fq]
;W[fp];B[gq]LB[hr:a][gp:b][fr:c]C[The play of B51 is careless, Black overlooks White's strong move at 'a'. With B51, Black should play hane at 'b', next W51 and B 'c', this way locally White is very difficult to capture Black cleanly.];W[hr];B[fm]C[B53: Black has no other choice but to turn direction.];W[fk];B[dk];W[bl];B[il];W[ik]
;B[hl]LB[gp:a]C[After the attachment of B59, next Black aims to pull out at 'a'.];W[gp]C[W60 reinforcing himself is the right move.];B[jk];W[jl];B[gk];W[gl];B[gj];W[hm];B[fl];W[im];B[ei]C[Through B69, it forms an exchange, White has a territory of about 70 at the bottom, it seems White's situation is not bad.]
;W[kh];B[li];W[fh];B[cq]C[B73 is an asking move, perhaps Kong Jie's time is insufficient, he makes some mistake.];W[hi]LB[dq:a][bo:b][bp:c]C[W74: If White blocks at 'a', White can simply kill Black, but Black has the sente move at 'b', White is reluctant to play it. If White kills Black at 'b', White takes some risk. In fact White can kill Black cleanly at 'c'. 

In the real game, White takes tenuki to seek some variations, and hopes to decide how to answer in the corner after settling shape in the attack. But this leads to White's defeat.];B[gi];W[gh];B[ci];W[cl]LB[bp:a]C[W78: For White to play at 'a' is the last chance, later on White already doesn't have any chance to take tenuki.]
;B[bg];W[bf];B[dh];W[cg];B[eg];W[eh];B[ch];W[cf];B[hh];W[bp]C[When White turns back to play W88, White's loss is already heavy.];B[hg];W[ff];B[hj]C[Black gets to push and capture with B91, Black is leading in the game.]
;W[je];B[jg];W[le]C[W94: White must invade in order to have a chance to win.];B[ie]C[B95: Black starts to kill the big dragon.];W[jd];B[id];W[kc];B[ib]LB[kb:a]C[B99: Black should play hane at 'a', allowing White to live one small group, Black can easily win the game.];W[ld];B[mc];W[ii]LB[kb:a][mb:b][if:c]C[W102 is an asking move and the last losing move of the game. White should simply descend at 'a', if Black tries to kill strongly at 'b', White has the good hane at 'c', this way the situation is complicated.]
;B[jh]C[After the exchange of W102 and B103, White is already very hard to make life.];W[ij];B[fj];W[dl];B[el];W[kb];B[mb];W[me];B[kg];W[oc];B[ob];W[lg];B[mg]
;W[lh];B[ji];W[pb];B[pc];W[mh];B[ng];W[kf];B[pd];W[nh];B[og];W[oj];B[ok];W[oo]
;B[po];W[nk];B[oi]C[Through B131, White's big dragon suddenly dies.

Therefore, Zhou Ruiyang becomes the youngest challenger in this event.])
