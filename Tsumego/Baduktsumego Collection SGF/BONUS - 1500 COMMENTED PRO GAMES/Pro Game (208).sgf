Nie Weiping 9p played so wonderfully in the first half of the game, all people thought he would continue to write his legendary, but a merciless mistake ruined his masterpiece and thus he lost the chance of advancing to the final 8.];W[dd];B[pq];W[dq];B[qk]
;W[nq]LB[kq:a][po:b][op:c][np:d][oo:e]C[White first checks with W6 then extends back at 'a', aiming to force Black to protect the corner at 'b'. If White first makes the extension at 'a', then checks with W6, Black most likely would not answer at 'b', Black may want to make the diagonal's extension at 'c', after W 'd' and B 'e', making White's two-space extension superfluous.];B[po];W[kq];B[co];W[cm];B[jp];W[jq];B[ip]

In the game, Black makes the diagonal's extension and aims to make White heavy. If White tenukis, Black next will not jump at 'a', instead Black may directly invade at 'f'.]
;W[nc];B[pf];W[pb];B[jn];W[bj];B[mn];W[qc];B[me];W[ck]LB[qd:a][lc:b][rf:c]C[W34 is not good. After being blocked by Black at 'a', Black not only gains a big profit and make a big moyo, Black can also play the knight's move at 'b' to wreck White's corner territory. So White should first make the knight's move at 'c' to gain territory as well as foil Black's plan.];B[qd]
;W[el];B[gk];W[nj];B[pi];W[nl];B[lc];W[fc];B[rc];W[rb];B[rd]C[Black hanes and connects with B43 and B45 in sente, Black has gained a big profit.];W[mb];B[lb]C[Black is very happy with the sequence from B41 to B47.]

;B[bi]C[B61 is clever!];W[pn]LB[ci:a][np:b][no:c]C[W62: White already can not move, if White plays at 'a' in reply, then Black can cut at 'b', Because Black's cut at 'c' is an all-dominating ko, White's left side would get killed by a ko fight.];B[ci];W[qm];B[rm];W[qo];B[rn];W[pp];B[bl]C[B69: After Black strikes and kills White, Black is leading in territory and also becomes thicker, Black's advantage is obvious.]

White can only make the diagonal's extension at 'a', then B 'b', W 80, B 'c', W 'd'. In the game W80 seems unyielding, after being pushed and cut with B 'c' and 'e', White is on the verge of death.]

;W[bc];B[gd]LB[cc:a]TR[ch]C[B95 is weak-hearted. If Black cuts at 'a', no matter how White responds, the marked white eight stones would be captured unconditionally or by a ko fight, this is out of the question for White, this way the game could be over soon. Also even if Black reduces White's liberties with 95 and 97, Black is beneficial too, however it makes a huge difference comparing to the cut at 'a'.];W[ad];B[gc];W[ed];B[di];W[li];B[pc];W[qb];B[mc];W[nb]
;B[mj];W[pj];B[ni];W[qj];B[qi];W[ri];B[rj]LB[rk:a][oj:b][pk:c][rh:d]C[B111 is a good move. If White ataris at 'a', then Black first ataris at 'b', after W 'c', Black could atari again at 'd', White will suffer a big defeat (see var a).]

;B[hl]LB[dk:a][dl:b]C[B137 is a mistake. Black should push at 'a' first to exchange for W 'b'.];W[fk];B[dk];W[hm]
(;B[fm]LB[dl:a][hk:b][gi:c][il:d][jl:e]C[B141 is careless. Now White is eyeing covetously, Black should be very cautious. Black should push at 'a', then W 'b', B 'c', W 'd' and B 'e', this way Black would have killed White's tail on the left, White's center would be still dangerous (see var a).];W[hk];B[il];W[gi];B[hj];W[fh]C[W146: After White cuts, Black cannot look after both the upper group and the lower group.];B[fi];W[gh]
;B[dl];W[gf]C[W150: After White killed Black's four key stones, although it is still a close game, but Teacher Nie has lost such a huge advantage in the game, he must feel very bad now.
