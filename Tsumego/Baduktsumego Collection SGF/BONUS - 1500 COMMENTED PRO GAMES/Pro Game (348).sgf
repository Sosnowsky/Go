Translation:GoGameWorld.];B[pd]C[On June 21st, in 2003 Korean KAT Cup Team Competition, Yoo Changhyeok 9p defeated Park YuongHoon 4p. After just one day interval from LG Cup, Yoo Changhyeok could walk away from the shadow of defeat, which fully shows his extraordinary quality as a first-rate player.];W[dd];B[pq];W[dq];B[co]
;W[ep]C[The small diagonal extension of W6 is a play that Yoo Changhyeok recently used to defeat Lee Changho, now Park YuongHoon adopts it to counter Yoo Changhyeok, it is psychological factor.];B[jp];W[qn];B[qp];W[qk];B[ck];W[qf];B[nc];W[rd];B[qc];W[ph];B[fc];W[cf]
;B[db];W[ci]LB[cc:a][ic:b][gq:c][cm:d][hq:e]C[The ensuing opening is quite common, but the two-space extension of W20 is worth study. Since now the value at top is not big, White should make the diagonal extension at 'a' to exchange with Black's two-space extension at 'b'. Moreover, after W20, Black's play at 'c' is just right to use attack as a means of defense, White is clearly no good. The correct sequence for White is first protect the corner, then invade at 'd' or extend to 'e', which is all playable.];B[gq];W[cm]C[The invasion of W22 is already one-step slow.];B[eo]C[B23: Black has adequate reasons to fight by attaching out.];W[gp];B[dp]C[When White attaches out, the squeezing move of B25 is usually a good play.]
;W[eq];B[fo];W[hq];B[cq];W[cr];B[br]C[Through 31, the sequence from both sides is almost inevitable.];W[bq]LB[dn:a]C[W32: From the state of mind, White should peep at 'a', although the variation is complicated, but White can fight, in the game, after playing the atari at 32, White has lost the chance of peep.];B[cp];W[ds];B[dl];W[cc]LB[ho:a][go:b]C[W36 is almost the losing move! In fact White should make the diagonal extension earlier, but now it is a bad timing. White certainly should get out by the diagonal extension at 'a' or press out at 'b'.]
;B[hp]C[After the cut of B37, the outside has been completely sealed off! White sinks into passivity.];W[ip];B[ho];W[iq];B[io];W[jq];B[fp];W[gr];B[go];W[hc];B[fr];W[bs];B[ed]
;W[kc];B[de];W[ce];B[dc];W[cd];B[kp]LB[lq:a][hr:b][jo:c][pk:d]C[With the shape-settling sequence after B55, the favorable consciousness is self-evident. The more severe play is for Black for check at 'a', then W 55, B 'b', W 'c' and B 'd', this way Black would not only gain territory and also utilize the power of the thick wall, this just conforms to the style of Yoo Changhyeok.];W[kq];B[lq];W[lr]
;B[mq];W[mr];B[nr];W[gs];B[oj];W[pi]LB[pk:a][nl:b]C[The selection of W64 is very difficult, but it seems to double up at 'a' is better, if so next White can get out with the knight's move at 'b', the speed would be faster.];B[lb];W[lc]C[W66 looks inevitable, in fact it is not. Now the value on the side is not big, White certainly should make the diagonal's move at 'a', this way Black can't crawl at 'b' and would be hard to attach at 'c' either.]LB[gd:a][kb:b][hb:c]
;B[kb];W[jb];B[mc];W[ka];B[ma];W[gd];B[cb];W[bb];B[ba];W[ab];B[hb];W[ib]TR[ib][jb]C[In the game, it is just right for Black to squeeze from the both left and right side, the two marked white stones equal to dame moves, White's shape is very bad, Black is already winning.]
;B[gc];W[hd];B[ga];W[om]TR[pi]C[W82: Now the improperness of the marked white stone can be seen.];B[hg]C[B83 is a good point, attacking White indirectly, Black's advantage is clear.];W[jg];B[ms];W[ks];B[ke];W[gf];B[gg]
;W[hf]C[W88 and W90 are all dame plays, White is extremely painful.];B[ig];W[if];B[jh];W[kf];B[kh];W[le];B[pl];W[ql];B[pm];W[pn];B[nm]C[The sequence from B91 through B101 is a combination of punches, especially the clamp of B101 disables White from moving.]
;W[on];B[ol];W[fi]LB[ro:a][lo:b]C[W104 appears a game-deciding move, in fact it leads to a fast defeat. Before Black plays the sente move at 'a', if White can get to peep at 'b', White probably would have a better chance of winning.];B[ro]C[Black is very happy with the diagonal extension of B105 in sente!];W[qm];B[pj];W[qj];B[di]C[B109 is a severe counterattack.];W[dh];B[eh]
;W[ei];B[dj];W[fh];B[eg];W[fg];B[ch];W[dg];B[ef];W[hi];B[bi]C[White again is forced to connect with a dame move, after Black ataris with B121 in sente, Black is already in an impregnable position.];W[bh];B[cj];W[bg]
;B[ii];W[gh];B[ih];W[ff];B[ni];W[fl];B[hk];W[lp];B[lo];W[hl];B[fk]C[In the end, under a great advantage, Yoo Changhyeok is not soft-hearted at all, Black counter-attaches with B135 to attack White, the difference between both sides has been enlarged further. When White concedes defeat, the difference on the board is about 20 points.];W[gk];B[gj]
