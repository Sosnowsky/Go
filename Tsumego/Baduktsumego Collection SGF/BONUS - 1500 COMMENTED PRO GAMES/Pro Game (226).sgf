Copyright by gogameworld.com and weiqi.tom.com.];B[qd]C[Hi, everybody, I'm Xie He, today I will comment live on this semi final game between Gu Li and Lee Sedol. Gu Li guesses Black, it is a good start.];W[dc];B[pp];W[dp];B[ce]
;W[ci];B[cn];W[cl];B[gc];W[ed];B[jd]C[Through B11, the opening is very similar to the game  between them in Chinese national league tournament, Gu Li first makes the exchange of B7 and W8, this perhaps is prepared.
];W[fq]C[In the opening, both sides play very fast, nobody wants to fall behind in momentum.];B[bc]C[B13 taking territory is related to B9 and B11, not allowing White's thickness to be utilized.];W[df];B[cf];W[dg];B[bh]
;W[bb];B[cc];W[cb];B[eb];W[db];B[bi];W[cj];B[bj];W[bk]C[Through W26, Black obtains sente and can be satisfied.];B[cp]C[The value of B27 is very big.];W[cq];B[bq]
;W[co];B[bp];W[do];B[cr];W[bo];B[dq]C[Through B35, Black's speed is fast, White is thick.];W[lc]C[The invasion of W36 is inevitable, Lee Sedol is good at using thickness.];B[oc];W[jc];B[ic];W[kd]LB[le:a]C[W38 and W40 are unexpected, the normal move is to jump out at 'a', since White has so many ko threats in the upper-left corner.]
;B[jb];W[kb];B[kc];W[ac];B[bd];W[jc];B[dk];W[ck];B[kc];W[de];B[cg];W[jc];B[ke]
;W[je];B[id];W[jf];B[le];W[ld];B[ne]C[B59: Black prepares to sacrifice the upper-left corner.];W[nc]LB[aj:a][bf:b][ec:c]C[W60: If White directly initiates the ko, next Black takes, W 'a', Black connects and B 'b', later on B 'c' is still sente, Black is favorable.];B[md]C[B61 is relentless.];W[mc]
;B[od];W[ib];B[kc];W[ob]C[W66: White has no mindset to capture the upper-left corner.];B[jc];W[pb]C[White can only connect with W62 and is painful, Lee Sedol overlooks the strong move of B61. White incurs loss in the exchange of W60 and W62.];B[lb];W[mb];B[ka]C[Through B71, Black is clearly not bad.];W[qc];B[rc];W[rb]
;B[rd];W[pg]LB[nd:a][me:b][oe:c][ma:d][nb:e][of:f][pe:g][pf:h]C[W76: White fights desperately. If W76 at 'a', then B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f', W 'g' and B 'h', Black gives up two stones, White is not good.];B[sb]C[B77 makes White very painful, Black is favorable.];W[pe];B[pd]
;W[nd]C[W80: White can only fight the ko as in the game, this must be not Lee Sedol's original plan.];B[oe];W[me];B[mf];W[lf];B[md];W[ad];B[me];W[ae];B[ma]C[Through B89, it forms an exchange, Black is thick and favorable.];W[qk];B[qm]
;W[nq];B[ok]LB[pq:a]C[B93: Black seeks the tempo of playing, the common move is to play at 'a', but Gu Li doesn't like such an insipid play.];W[pl];B[on];W[ol];B[pq];W[pn];B[qn];W[nn]C[White seals off with W100, making Black a little uncomfortable.];B[np]LB[no:a]C[B101: Black can consider to hane at 'a'.]
;W[mp];B[no];W[mo];B[nm];W[mn];B[om];W[mk];B[nl];W[nk];B[oj]C[B109 and B111: Black has no other alternative, it is very difficult to imagine here occurs a fight.];W[ni]C[W112: White sacrifices.];B[ll]
;W[ml];B[mm];W[lm];B[pm];W[kl];B[hq]C[The sequence from B113 to B119 is very weird.];W[kq]C[W120 is a good move, Black incurs loss with the fight in the lower-right corner];B[jq]C[B121 is a good move, Black has many ko threats in the upper-left corner.];W[jp];B[ip];W[jr];B[ir]
;W[iq];B[ag];W[af]C[The first feeling of W128 is, the game record is wrong. The purpose of this move is to prevent Black from initiating the ko at the bottom, but the aji is very bad.];B[jq];W[na]C[W130 is also a damaging ko threat.];B[nb];W[iq];B[ch];W[bf];B[jq];W[io]C[After this move, it is time for lunch break.];B[oi]LB[ho:a]C[B137: Black can consider to hang at 'a'.]
;W[oh];B[nj];W[mj];B[nh];W[mi];B[ph];W[og];B[qi]LB[pi:a]C[B145 perhaps is Gu Li's miscalculation, Black should connect at 'a'.];W[ri];B[rh];W[pi];B[pj]
;W[qj];B[qh];W[sh]C[W152 is tesuji, Black can't kill White unconditionally, Black incurs loss.];B[rg];W[rf];B[rj];W[sj];B[si];W[er];B[dr];W[ri];B[ql];W[rk]
;B[pk];W[iq];B[gg]LB[gf:a]C[B165: Black enters into the center, although the situation is closer, but it is still to Black's favor, Lee Sedol probably will release game-deciding move, for example, to attach at 'a'.];W[ge];B[jq]LB[hf:a][jh:b]C[The timing of B167 is not good, Black should make the diagonal at 'a', if White pushes and cuts, then B 'b'.];W[hf];B[ep];W[iq]LB[eo:a]C[W170: White can consider to press at 'a'.]
;B[eo];W[en];B[dn];W[bn];B[fn];W[em];B[jq];W[fo];B[fp];W[go];B[gp]C[Black's judgment with B179 and B181 is accurate, Gu Li is already not far from victory.];W[ho];B[mh]C[After Black attaches with B183, Black is leading about 10 points on the board.]
;W[lh];B[lg];W[kh];B[rl]LB[iq:a]C[B187: For Black to first connect at 'a' is more clear and simple.];W[iq];B[ec];W[dd];B[jq];W[kg];B[kf];W[iq];B[bm]
;W[dm];B[jq];W[mg];B[ng];W[iq];B[lk];W[li];B[jq];W[nf];B[of];W[iq];B[ln];W[km]
;B[jq];W[hp];B[gq]LB[iq:a]C[B211: If Black plays at 'a', Black can win even bigger, Gu Li elects to play the clearest move.];W[iq]C[Today Gu Li's play is very brilliant and achieves a complete victory over Lee Sedol.];B[mr];W[mq];B[nr];W[lr];B[oq];W[is];B[hr]
;W[fs];B[eq];W[hs];B[fd];W[fe];B[ie];W[if];B[fr];W[es];B[ds];W[gs];B[ao]C[Therefore China will obtain both champion and second-place in this term, Gu Li hopefully can win his first world champion.])
