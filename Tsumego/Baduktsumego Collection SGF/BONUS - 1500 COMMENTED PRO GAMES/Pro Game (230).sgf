Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[Yu Bin is in a very good state recently, in the round 2 of the 9th LG Cup ended on 5/20, he defeated Park Seunghyeon and advanced to the quarter-final.];W[dc];B[dq];W[pp];B[ce]
;W[ed];B[oc];W[do];B[ch]LB[cm:a]C[B9: For Black to pincer at around 'a' is more positive.];W[cq];B[ic];W[cd];B[ck]C[I can't agree with the play of B11 and B13, Black's position is too low! Besides, this kind of play is very hard to show Black's efficiency of playing first.];W[dr];B[eq];W[er]

(;W[qn]LB[pn:a][pr:b][kr:c][qk:d][iq:e][qf:f]C[W24: If I were White, I would elect to jump to 'a', if Black still plays B 'b' followed by B 'c', W 'd', B 'e' and W 'f', this would be better than the play in the game (see var a).];B[pr];W[qq];B[kr];W[jq];B[ql];W[lq]
;B[qr]C[Black takes tenuki with B29 and B31, it is a smart choice. Because B29 is too enticing! And by playing W28 and W30 consecutively, White doesn't get a big profit as imagined.];W[mq];B[nr];W[oo];B[mp];W[om];B[rq];W[rp];B[pq];W[qp];B[rr]C[The hane and connect of B37 and B41 is related to the eye space for both sides, it is urgent point.];W[pk]
;B[qj];W[qk];B[rk];W[rl];B[hq];W[qe]LB[rj:a]C[The play of W48 to W52 is a little heavy, simply playing atari at 'a' is better.];B[pe];W[qf];B[pd];W[pf];B[ri]LB[of:a][og:b][pg:c][rm:d][qh:e]C[B53: If seeking efficiency, Black can consider to simply hane at 'a', if White hanes at 'b', Black can hang at 53, next the cut at 'c' and the atari at 'd' become miai, if White still makes one-space extension at 'e', Black can reserve the aji of playing the atari at 'd', White is also painful.]

;B[hp]LB[eo:a]C[The push and cut of B67 is too impetuous! Only if you can capture White, otherwise it will leave White to use the aji for other purposes. With B67, Black should attach at 'a'.];W[ho];B[go];W[iq];B[gq];W[gn];B[fo];W[jn];B[ko];W[jm];B[il];W[lo]
;B[kn];W[lp];B[kl];W[fn];B[eo];W[en];B[dp];W[bo];B[ir];W[km];B[lm]C[Because White is very thick on the right side, Black can only sacrifice three stones with B89, Black's attack here clearly fails.];W[ln];B[jl]
;W[jp];B[ie];W[ig];B[fk]LB[kf:a]C[B95: If Black encloses at 'a' normally, Black's territory would be inadequate, but Black is not sure where to start attack, Black is already difficult to play.];W[gg];B[ee];W[bd];B[ge]LB[fd:a][fc:b][ii:c]C[The jump of B99 is too slow! Black should hane at 'a', then W 'b' and B 'c', this way White would also put some pressure on White.

;W[jj]LB[ii:a]TR[il][jl][kl]C[W100 is an excellent point! Although Black can separate White at 'a', but White can take the chance to capture the marked black stones, with this exchange, Black's territory is still not enough.
];B[ii];W[ij];B[hj];W[ji];B[hi];W[li];B[gl]LB[hk:a]C[B107: Black's aji would be better if retreating at 'a'.]
;W[kf];B[mj]C[After the knight's move of W108, Black still wants to capture White with B109 since being pressed by the unfavorable situation.];W[kd];B[kb];W[nh];B[oh];W[jr];B[js];W[pj];B[ni];W[mi];B[nj];W[hk]LB[ih:a]C[W120 in unnecessary, by simply bumping at 'a', White makes life easily.]
;B[lj];W[ik]LB[ih:a]C[The exchange of W122 and B123 is also bad, White still should bump at 'a'.
];B[hl];W[ih];B[mm]LB[kh:a]C[With the extension of B125, Black surprisingly ends in gote in such a critical moment! It is clearly due to miscalculation or time pressure, Black certainly should hit at 'a' to capture White, this is the only chance for Black.];W[fp];B[ep];W[gs]TR[kr]C[The knight's move of W128 is a good move! White can capture the marked black stone.]

;W[is];B[dn];W[lc]LB[mf:a]C[But W142 is too unreasonable! If White strengthens at 'a', Black already have no chance of winning.];B[kh];W[ki];B[le];W[ke];B[bn];W[cr];B[cn];W[ao];B[lh]
;W[jh]LB[gj:a][gi:b]C[Before the connection of W152, White should first exchange W 'a' and B 'b', in the game after White captures three stones, White is still not alive yet, the situation becomes a little chaotic.];B[mh];W[if];B[gd];W[hc];B[bs];W[es];B[em];W[cs];B[fc];W[fb]

;W[gf];B[lb];W[jc];B[ib];W[mb];B[mc];W[jb];B[ja];W[nb];B[hb]LB[id:a][hf:b][hg:c]C[B181 is the last losing move! Black should connect at 'a', this way W 'b' and W 'c' are all gote, White wouldn't make life easily, in the game with B181 Black clearly reduce his own liberties, 'a' and 'b' become all sente, Black already can't capture White.]
