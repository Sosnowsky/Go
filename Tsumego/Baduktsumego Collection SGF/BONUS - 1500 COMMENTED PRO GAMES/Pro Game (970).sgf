;W[jp]C[As to the opening of B5, B6 is not a bad play.];B[pj];W[nc];B[lc]LB[pf:a]C[B9: Black ends in gote, which is a little reluctant, for Black to jump to 'a' and obtain sente is relatively better.];W[qc];B[qd];W[pc];B[od];W[nb];B[me];W[dj]LB[mq:a]C[W16: White can also play at 'a', this will break up the situation.

In the game, Kong Jie forces Park to play moyo game, which is perhaps his planned fighting strategy.]
;B[lp]LB[lq:a][lo:b]C[B17: Black can't play one line lower at 'a', otherwise White will cap at 'b', Black's moyo on the right side will be reduced dramatically.];W[fp]LB[fq:a]C[W18: For White to play at 'a' is steady.];B[kn];W[qq];B[ro];W[jk]C[W22: White can consider to take "Tengen".];B[in]LB[jj:a]C[At any rate, Black always will play B23, W22 at 'a' is farther from Black's thickness, White is better off.]
;W[jm];B[jn];W[mk]C[The play of W26 is inevitable. The center is clearly bigger than the bottom.];B[hp];W[hq]LB[ni:a]C[W28: White perhaps didn't expect Black would take tenuki. Otherwise White will first strengthen at 'a', since locally White is difficult to respond.];B[iq];W[hr];B[mi]C[B31: Black simply takes tenuki and is of great momentum.];W[ok];B[oj];W[jq]C[W34 makes W20 have more room for maneuver, territory potential is very big.]
;B[cf]C[So far, White takes lead in territory, Black must obtain profit by attacking White's stones in the center to keep balance.];W[ce];B[df];W[fd];B[gj]C[B39 is very unrestrained and natural, it appears not bad.];W[hl];B[gl];W[gm];B[fl]LB[hm:a][gk:b]C[B43: If Black cuts at 'a', White can play atari at 'a' and push through, Black is unreasonable.];W[hm]
;B[dl];W[fi]C[Just when we are all thinking a good show of attacking vs. dodging will start, Park YuongHoon surprisingly plays consecutive bad moves, which leads to an inferior situation quickly, it is inexplicable.];B[gi]LB[ff:a]C[B47 is the first questionable move, for Black to jump at 'a' is better.];W[fh];B[ff];W[gh];B[ii];W[gf]C[Through W52, Black is being sealed off and clearly incurs loss.];B[ll];W[lk];B[kl]
;W[kk];B[fj];W[dh];B[ki]LB[il:a]C[B57 and B59 are most explicable, here there is no cut point, why making exchange and giving up three stones at top? If Black wants to play B59, Black should play it directly with B57, Black's three stones would still have some room for maneuver, this is much better than the real game. Furthermore, if Black already plays B57, next Black should cut at 'a' to fight desperately with White, this way at least Black can give a play to B57.];W[hj];B[hi];W[ho]C[W62: White connects safely, Black's three stones have died unconditionally, Black's loss is very heavy.];B[cc];W[be];B[ec];W[ed]
