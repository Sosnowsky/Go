;W[hq];B[oq]C[W4: For White to play 3-3 is rarely seen in recent games. B5 and B7 are common opening moves nowadays. If Black only plays B7, later on if Black approaches with B5, White may not elect to pincer tightly with W6.];W[qj];B[dd];W[cd];B[de];W[dc];B[fd];W[ec];B[gf];W[gc];B[ql];W[qg]
;B[fo];W[eq]LB[fr:a][cn:b][dn:c]C[The diagonal-bump of W20 is a rare move, perhaps White should wait after Black's descent at 'a', then consider whether to make the knight's move at 'b' or simply jump to 'c'.];B[gq]C[Black elects to bump with B21, with W22 White naturally doesn't need to make choice.];W[cn];B[hp]C[Black hanes at the head with B23, Black's shape is good.];W[nc];B[pf];W[re];B[pg]

;B[ni];W[oe];B[oj];W[pe]C[When W26, with B27 Black can first strike at 35, in the game when Black plays B35, it leads to some other variations, White pushes and cuts with W36 and W38, through W44, Black's one stone is being captured, locally Black incurs a huge loss in territory.];B[dm];W[dn];B[em];W[bl];B[iq]C[Through B49, Black encloses a big moyo.];W[ip];B[io];W[jp]
;B[hr];W[oo]C[As to White, W52 is friendly troop, so White dives into Black's moyo with W54, and decides to make life one group inside opponent's influence.];B[nn]C[Being pressed by the situation, Black caps with B55 and wants to kill all white stones.];W[no];B[mo];W[nq]C[Following W58, White dodges himself.];B[mp];W[pq];B[or]C[B61: Black has no other choice.];W[pp]C[W64 and W66 are good tactic, Black's liberty is very tight.];B[qo]
;W[pn];B[qn];W[mn];B[nm];W[mq];B[np]C[B59 is overplay, Black should wedge and cut at 69, it will lead to a solvable life-and-death problem, however this way Black still can fight.];W[op];B[lq];W[lp];B[lo];W[lr];B[mr];W[kq]
;B[nr];W[lq];B[pr];W[ho]C[W80 is good order.];B[in];W[ko];B[ln];W[lm];B[kn];W[jn];B[km];W[im];B[hn]
;W[kl];B[mm];W[jm];B[ll];W[jo]C[Through W94, White's big group already extricates himself from a predicament.];B[cq];W[dr];B[ck]C[Black's territory is inadequate. B95 is a probe, then Black makes the knight's move of B97, in fact Black still wants to kill White's big dragon.];W[fr];B[cp];W[co];B[ik]

;W[ao];B[bo];W[am];B[qf];W[rf];B[an];W[qq];B[qr];W[am];B[bs];W[cm];B[ds];W[bk]C[But White lives the big group with W140, Black already is in no mood to continue the game.]
;B[dh];W[eg];B[ci];W[eo];B[ar];W[fn]C[After White separates Black's several stones with W144 and W146, Black is on the way to a big defeat.];B[bf];W[bg];B[bh];W[ch];B[qc];W[cg];B[qe]

;B[ob];W[gb];B[ic];W[ke];B[gd];W[gj]C[In this game, both sides together have only used less than 3 hours, it is hard to imagine they are competing for the right to challenge Mingren Title, Luo Xihe only used 31 minutes, as to him, is the opposite of boldness a little carelessness?])
