;B[kd];W[of];B[qg];W[id];B[kf];W[ph];B[pg]LB[qh:a]C[B13: Black can also crawl at 'a', the push and cut in the game will lead to more complicated variations.];W[og];B[oh];W[pj];B[nh];W[qh]
;B[rh];W[pd]LB[qe:a][ri:b]C[W20 is a good sequence play, next if Black retreats to 'a', then White would hane at 'b', White would gain some advantages in sente.]
(;B[qj]LB[qc:a][qe:b][re:c][rf:d]C[B21 is the vital point for shape, if Black retreats to 'a', then W 'b', B 'c' and W 'd', Black is no good (see var a).];W[qe]C[The hane of W22 is impulsive.];B[pi];W[qc]C[Through 24, the fight in the upper right comes to an end, Black is very happy.];B[oo]C[B25 is a tightly attacking move.];W[on]LB[pp:a][op:b][qq:c]C[W26 is to my surprise, I feel that White is better to settle herself quickly with the sequence of W 'a', B 'b' and W 'c'.]
;B[op];W[nn];B[pn]C[After the cut of B29, Black not only obtains the corner territory but also snatches away White's base, and Black is satisfied.];W[pm];B[qn];W[qm];B[ro];W[rn];B[qo];W[qk]C[W36: White elects to make life on the spot, it is the right choice.];B[pk];W[oj]
;B[ok];W[rj];B[qi];W[rl];B[fc];W[fe]TR[id]C[The false cap of W44 is a good move, Black can no longer attack the marked white stone.];B[cc]C[B45: Black turns to grab territory.];W[dc];B[cd];W[de];B[db]
;W[eb];B[cb];W[ec];B[cf];W[le]C[The peep of W54 is a bit inexplicable.];B[ie]C[After the attachment of B55, White is hard to answer.];W[he];B[je]LB[hd:a][ic:b]C[After W54 and W56, White elects to tenuki, but after the exchange for these four moves, Black is left with the maneuver of the cut at 'a' and the clamp at 'b', Black has strengthened himself at the top.];W[so];B[sp]
;W[sn];B[rq];W[nj]C[W62 is a surprising move.];B[nk];W[mj];B[mk];W[lj];B[lk];W[mg];B[kk]C[Through 69, the exchange is obviously favorable for Black.];W[kj];B[rf]LB[re:a][sl:b][sg:c]C[B71: Black reinforces to make life, it is also a big endgame play, now if White blocks at 'a', White would end in gote, because Black has the clever attachment at 'b', White can not kill Black anymore by playing at 'c'.]
;W[jk];B[ln]LB[pl:a]C[B73: Black can also elect to destroy White's eyes at 'a', forcing White to run out, then Black takes the chance to stick her head out. In the game Black has selected a simple play.];W[pl];B[mc];W[jc];B[kc];W[jb];B[hf];W[ge];B[lg];W[mh];B[mf]
;W[ng];B[me]C[After Black lives with B85, Black is leading in territory and Black also has a big potential on the lower side, the game is easier for Black to play.];W[jm]C[W86: White aims to threaten Black and at the same time break up Black's territorial potential at the bottom.];B[ko];W[jq];B[io];W[hp];B[fq];W[ho];B[kq];W[kr];B[lq]
;W[jp];B[fo]C[With B91 and B97, Black has already gained.];W[jo];B[km]C[Black reinforces herself, B99 is a solid move.];W[lr];B[jn]LB[im:a]C[B101 is an asking move, if White retreats to 'a', White would become thin.];W[in];B[jl];W[kn];B[il];W[lm]
;B[jn];W[rp];B[qp];W[kn]C[Through 106, it leads to a very light ko.];B[kl];W[jn]C[W112 is not good, at a glance it seems White has won the ko fight, but the big point on the left has been taken by Black, White's situation has further deteriorated.];B[el]LB[dl:a]C[B113: Black grabs another big point, however its position is quite questionable, B113 at 'a' would be much better, Black is a little reckless.];W[co];B[dp];W[cl]C[After the attachment of W114 and the extension of W116, Black is very painful.]

;W[nd];B[nb];W[ob];B[do];W[gi];B[mm]LB[hi:a]C[B161 is no good, Black originally wants to take advantage in sente, but as a result, Black's big dragon becomes ko-alive, Black should simply connect back at 'a'.];W[mn];B[ll];W[ij];B[mo];W[no];B[mp]
