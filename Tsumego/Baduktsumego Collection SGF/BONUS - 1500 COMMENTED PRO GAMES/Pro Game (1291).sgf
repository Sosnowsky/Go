;B[ce];W[ed];B[oc];W[cn];B[ck]C[The two-space pincer of B9 is seldom seen nowadays.];W[fq];B[dn];W[dm];B[fp]C[From B11 and B13, Black clearly has well prepared.];W[do]LB[gp:a][fn:b]C[If W14 hanes at 'a', then Black may jump to 'b'.] 
;B[cp];W[gp];B[fn]C[B17 is light and nimble.];W[dk];B[eo];W[cj];B[co]C[From the result up to 21, Black is obviously favorable.];W[jq];B[id];W[cd];B[qn];W[ql] 
;B[pi]C[B27 gives a fresh and new feeling, Black's whole board configuration is vivid.];W[pn];B[qq]C[B29 is a good play, White is uneasy.];W[qp];B[pq];W[oq];B[or];W[rq];B[rr];W[nr];B[rp];W[pr] 
;B[qr];W[ro];B[sq];W[qo]C[Through 42, Black obtains sente and can be satisfied.];B[fc];W[fd];B[gc];W[kc];B[cb]C[B47 is very good timing.];W[de]LB[db:a][bd:b]C[If W48 blocks at 'a', then Black will hane over at 'b', White is no good.] 
;B[db]C[Through 49, Black has obtained some profit in territory.];W[cl]C[W50 still has to prevent Black from extending here, White is unhappy.];B[fg]C[At a glance, the reduction at B51 is slightly deep.];W[gd];B[hc];W[hf]C[W52 and W54 are certain counter-attack moves.];B[ig]TR[fg][kc]C[B55 is a hard-to-find relentless move, while helping the marked black stone, it also aims to attack the marked white stone.];W[if];B[jf] 
;W[je];B[ie];W[hg];B[jg];W[hh];B[ke]LB[cf:a][gi:b][fj:c]C[Through 63, White still does not kill Black completely on the left, for example, Black has the maneuver of playing at 'a', 'b' or 'c', what's more, Black's moyo in the upper right is huge, how White reduces Black's big moyo is the key for the game.];W[nc]C[From the result, W64 is not successful.];B[nd];W[md] 
;B[od];W[mc]LB[mb:a]C[W68 seems no better than the tiger move at 'a'.];B[jb]C[B69 seeks to kill the whole group.];W[mf]LB[le:a]C[W70 playing the diagonal move at 'a' seems better.];B[mh];W[lg];B[lh];W[jd]C[White apparently has miscalculated with the sequence following W74.];B[kb]C[B75 is the vital point for attack and defense, White sinks into a difficult situation.] 
;W[kd];B[le];W[kf];B[kh]C[B79 is thick, White has no good moves.];W[of]LB[lb:a]C[W80 is better to be played at 'a'.];B[ld]C[B81 is brilliant, White clearly has overlooked this move.];W[lc];B[ne];W[me];B[ob]C[Through 85, White is already hard to escape from death.] 
;W[nf];B[pg]C[Black calculates accurately with the sequence following B87.];W[nh];B[ni];W[oh];B[oi];W[ph];B[qh];W[qg];B[qf];W[rg];B[rf];W[qi]
