;B[kc];W[pn]LB[qk:a]C[W8 is rarely seen, the common move is to split at 'a'.];B[qo];W[qn];B[po];W[on];B[pi]C[B13: Black is able to expand on both sides and can be satisfied.];W[np];B[nr]LB[oo:a]C[B15: Black first strengthens himself, but it appears a little weak, Black can fight by playing push-and-cut at 'a'.]
;W[mm]LB[oo:a][qq:b][rq:c]C[W16 is to guard against the push at 'a', White can also first attach at 'b' to probe Black, if Black still pincers at 'c', White can turn at 'a' to grab sente.];B[db];W[od];B[pf];W[of]LB[qc:a][rc:b][pc:c]C[W20 is meaningless, for White to attach at 'a' directly is better, next B 'b' and W 'c', White can make base locally, this is more substantial.];B[og];W[qc]
;B[rc];W[pe]LB[rd:a][pd:b]C[W24: If White plays at 'a', then B 'b', White is not good.];B[qf]LB[qe:a]C[B25: Black should block at 'a', in the game Black seems to have incurred loss.];W[mf];B[nf];W[ne];B[ng];W[ld];B[lc]
;W[mg];B[hd]C[B33 reinforcing back is very necessary.];W[qq];B[rq];W[dn]LB[ci:a]C[W36 is inexplicable! Black at the top is very thick, so White should make extension at 'a', making White itself thick first is better.];B[ci]C[B37 is a good point!];W[ck];B[cc]C[B39 is a related good move!];W[ff];B[fi]LB[ei:a][hf:b][ek:c]C[The step of B41 is too big, Black's shape is a little thin, for Black to jump at 'a' is better, next W 'b' and B 'c'.]
;W[hf];B[fg]C[B43: Black hopes to fix the shape.];W[fd]LB[eg:a]C[W44: White seems to have more severe play, for example, playing hane at 'a', this way Black is difficult to answer.];B[ef];W[ec];B[cd]C[B47 is the vital point, White is not comfortable.];W[de];B[fb];W[gg];B[eh];W[gd]
;B[hc];W[gh];B[gi];W[ee]C[Through W56, Black again obtains sente, Black's speed is faster, if White can't attack Black effectively, it is afraid that White's territory is not enough.];B[iq];W[qe];B[re];W[pd];B[rd];W[qj]LB[gq:a]C[W62 is small, White should force at 'a' and also aim to attack Black on the left side.];B[pj]
;W[qk];B[oe]LB[rg:a]C[B65 is to guard against White's peep at 'a'.];W[nd];B[dr]C[B67 is an enticing good point!];W[rp]TR[qj]C[The play of W68 and the marked white stone is contradictory with each other, if White wants to live the corner, then the extension value of the marked stone is even smaller.];B[ro];W[eq];B[er];W[gq];B[cp]
;W[co];B[bp]C[B75: Black takes the corner in sente and is very happy.];W[fr];B[lq]C[After Black defends back with B77, Black is leading in territory.];W[ej];B[dg];W[cg];B[ch]C[B79 and B81 are good moves to fix shape.];W[pr]TR[rp]LB[pc:a]C[W82 is the follow-up tactic of the earlier marked stones, it is not to White's advantage, White should play at around at 'a' to attack Black.]
;B[qr];W[oq];B[qp];W[or];B[nq];W[op];B[mp];W[jr]C[W90 is a relentless move.];B[jq]LB[ir:a][jp:b][ip:c][gk:d]C[B91: If Black plays at 'a', then after wrapping up with W91, B 'b' and W 'c', White can fly-attack at 'd', Black can't be satisfied.]
;W[ir];B[kr];W[hr]LB[hq:a]C[W94: White certainly should bump at 'a'.];B[dq]C[B95 is to guard against other variations later on in the corner.];W[ep];B[pk]LB[mn:a][ln:b]C[B97 is a strong move, to play at 'a' or 'b' directly is steady.];W[kp]C[The counterattack of W98 is inevitable.];B[mn]C[B99: Black is not willing to fall behind.]
;W[nn];B[ln];W[kq]C[White cuts with W102, it forms a complicated fight.];B[lr];W[lm];B[jo]C[B105: Black obtains sente by sacrificing.];W[jp];B[ip];W[ko];B[kn];W[io];B[jn]
;W[hp];B[pl]C[Black is very happy to take advantage in sente with B113.];W[nl];B[jl]C[B115: Black sails smoothly!];W[hj]C[W116: White fights desperately.];B[kj]C[B117: Black attacks in order to defend, forcing White to make life.];W[mj];B[mi];W[jk]C[W120 is a good move locally! With this attachment, White's big dragon is getting out of danger.];B[kl];W[lj]
;B[kk];W[li]C[W124: Although White gets to escape, Black also becomes very thick.];B[hi];W[ii]C[W126: White knows it is unreasonable but has to play this way.];B[ij];W[jj];B[ki];W[lh];B[gk];W[ik]LB[hl:a]C[W132: White should jump to 'a' to make some threads. In the game, after Black connects safely at 'a', White already can't win the game.];B[hl]
;W[ih];B[ek];W[il];B[hm];W[dj];B[bh]C[From B131 to B139, Black proceeds safely.];W[br];B[cr];W[ql];B[rm];W[qm];B[bs]C[B145: Black lives completely, Black's advantage is obvious.]

;B[qa];W[ib];B[hb];W[la];B[lb];W[ja]C[W164 is a game-deciding move.];B[nb];W[na];B[ma];W[eb];B[ea];W[mb];B[nc]
;W[oc];B[rb];W[oa];B[ma];W[rg];B[rf];W[mb];B[kd]C[B179 is a safe move.];W[ma];B[he];W[df];B[eg];W[ge]
;B[if];W[gc];B[gb];W[ic]C[W188: White hopes Black make mistake.];B[hh];W[hg];B[je]C[B191 shatters White's illusion.];W[id];B[ie];W[ke];B[ig]C[After B195, White in the center is being captured, Black wins the game for sure.];W[dc]
