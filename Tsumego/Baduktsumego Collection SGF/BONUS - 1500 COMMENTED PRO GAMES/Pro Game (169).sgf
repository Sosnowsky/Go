(;SZ[19]EV[1st Red Ginseng Cup Women Go Contest round 1]DT[2002-11-07]PC[Seoul, Korea]KM[6.5]PB[Kobayashi Izumi]BR[5p]PW[Rui Naiwei]WR[9p]RE[W+R]C[Commentary: Chang Hao 9p, Copyright by gogameworld.com and weiqi.tom.com];B[pd]C[Rui Naiwei 9p and Kobayashi Izumi 5p are Korean and Japanese #1 women player respectively, what surprises me in this game is that Kobayashi Izumi does not have any chance through the whole game.];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp]
;B[qo];W[gq];B[ci];W[cg];B[cl];W[cn];B[fc];W[jd]C[W12 pincer is the style of Rui Naiwei, the losing moves for Black appear too early in the game.];B[dc];W[cc];B[cb]LB[cd:a][de:b][eb:c]C[B15 can first cut at 'a', after White retreats to 'b', then Black ataris at 15, B 'c' hangs. In the real game, White selects to play outside and results in a ko fight.]
;W[ec];B[db];W[fd];B[eb];W[gc];B[ed];W[ee];B[cd];W[ec];B[bp]LB[dq:a]C[Though there are no ko threats in the opening, B25 is really too small! To find ko threats, B25 shoule play in the places where are painful for White like 'a', if finding one big ko threat, Black will hand the problem to White to find a ko threat.];W[ce];B[bc]
;W[fb]C[After W28 takes, White is very thick, however Black's corner needs one more move to live.];B[bn];W[lp];B[jq]C[B31 invasion is too hasty! Kobayashi Izumi's state of mind is not right. There are still many big points on the board, invasion is not the only choice. She is too eager to fight with Rui Naiwei! but this attitude often ends up with losing more quickly, the game shows us exactly this point.];W[jo];B[io];W[oq]C[W34 is a good move, making a feint to the east and attack in the west. White exchanges several moves with Black and cuts Black's way home.];B[pp];W[pr];B[qr];W[jn];B[jp]LB[hq:a]C[B39 hit is awkward, the vital point for the shape is the attachment at 'a'.]
;W[in];B[ho];W[hq]C[After W42 strikes in the game, it's painful for Black to guard against cutting clumsily.];B[fp];W[fq];B[iq];W[gm];B[fn];W[hn];B[go];W[cp];B[bo];W[bq]LB[cm:a][dl:b]C[Actually W52 could be more brutal, W52 can hit at 'a', after Black blocks, then W 'b' can hane, Black's big dragon in the center is dangerous.]
;B[br];W[cr];B[aq];W[cq];B[dn];W[qf]LB[ij:a]C[W58 does not reinforce at around 'a' but directly approaches the corner, it shows Rui Naiwei is not afraid of attack and very confident in her fighting ability.];B[lo]LB[pi:a]C[B59 starts attacking White as expected, in fact now Black should pincer calmly at 'a', after spending several moves outside, then attack at 59.];W[mo]C[The sequence from W60 to W68 has no room for manoeuvre.];B[ln]
;W[mn];B[lm];W[mm];B[ll];W[ml];B[lk];W[nj];B[hj]C[B69 is almost the only point for attack.];W[jk]C[But because the ladder is favorable for White, W70 unexpectedly dares to fight back directly and come out!];B[jj];W[kj];B[kk]
;W[ij];B[ji];W[ii];B[ik];W[jl];B[il];W[im];B[jh];W[hk];B[hl];W[gk];B[kl];W[jm]
;B[hh];W[gl];B[hi];W[fi];B[fh];W[el];B[ej]LB[ei:a]C[B93 at 'a' is common, but now even knowing it is unconvincing, White has to go ahead and try to kill White's dragon.];W[ei];B[fj];W[gj];B[gi];W[dj]
;B[di];W[eh];B[eg];W[dh];B[dk];W[dm];B[co];W[hm]LB[ih:a]C[W106 takes and Black must strengthen, otherwise Black will collapse if White pushes through at 'a'.];B[gg];W[kp];B[ko];W[mp]
;B[mk]LB[lj:a][mj:b]C[B111 must reinforce too, or White can attach at 'a', no matter whether Black wedges at 'b' or extends to 111, due to lack of liberties Black will die.];W[do];B[cm];W[en]C[W114 starts to revenge.];B[fm];W[ek]LB[cj:a][lr:b]C[When W116 ataris, Black can not take at 'a', it shows how farfetched it is for Black to kill White's dragon! The outcome again results in a ko fight, but Black surprisingly can not find any ko threat, and eventually can only knights jump to 'b' to make life bitterly. White is too easy to know how to play!];B[em];W[cn]
;B[eq];W[er];B[dn];W[ip];B[hp];W[cn];B[lr];W[nk];B[cj];W[dl];B[dn];W[ki]C[W130 is brutal and a typical style of Rui. Before strengthening, Black forms another wall taking advantage of Black's shortage of liberties, Black's big group in the center is miserable.];B[mi]

;B[oe];W[fk];B[dj];W[dn]C[W148 calls off the battle.];B[df]TR[fi]C[Black keeps busy for a while but only captures a few useless white stones.];W[or];B[hr];W[gr];B[is];W[de];B[cf]
;W[mr];B[mq];W[nq];B[ms];W[lq];B[jr];W[mr];B[kr];W[bf];B[ch];W[bd]C[When W166 takes care of Black's corner, the game has been decided.];B[ad];W[be]
;B[ql]LB[qm:a]C[Finally even if B169 can make life in the upper left corner, White needs only to press at 'a' to put Black into trouble again in the lower right corner.];W[ea];B[pj];W[pi];B[lc];W[qc];B[kd];W[je];B[jc];W[ic];B[ib];W[jb]
