Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[After he lost to Luo Xihe, Chang Hao 9p missed a very good chance to obtain the Mingren challenge right.];W[dc];B[dp];W[pp];B[ce]
;W[ed];B[oc];W[df];B[cf]LB[cg:a]C[The crawl of B9 is too heavy, jumping at 'a' is relatively better. At the start of opening, it is always not good to be enclosed in a corner.];W[dh]C[Based on this idea, the jump of W10 is a good move! Black is not smooth to stick his head out, Black is not comfortable.];B[cc];W[cb];B[ch]LB[bb:a]C[B13 is unreasonable! The original move is for Black to play hane at 'a'.]
(;W[di]LB[ci:a][de:b][cg:c][ef:d][dg:e][ee:f][fd:g][dd:h]C[The retreat of W14 is not good, White should play hane at 'a', next B 'b', W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f' and W 'g', this way Black's shape will be heavy and over-concentrated, White is better (see var a). In the postgame analysis, Chang Hao said he also saw this variation in the game, but he felt the extension of W14 is better, however he overlooked Black's tactic at 'h'.];B[ci];W[dj];B[dd];W[eb]LB[ec:a][ee:b][ef:c]C[As to the result from W18 to B29, Black is not bad, therefore with W18 White should connect at 'a'. Afterwards, when B 'b', White can clamp strongly at 'c', this variation is better than the real game.]
;B[ee];W[de];B[dg];W[cd];B[ef];W[cj];B[dd];W[de];B[cn];W[gi];B[hf];W[fq];B[gn]C[B31: Black's attack will is very strong, although it seems a little "hypocritical", but B31 is a very talented move.]
;W[ii]LB[iq:a]C[W32 is thick! Because of different style, for White to play at 'a' to enclose territory first is also possible. I personally prefer to play at 'a', because the top side is not easy to come under attack.];B[hp]C[B33 is a very confusing move, at a glance not sure what is Black's purpose, but if you are not careful, you will fall into a trap! Lou Xihe has many this kind of moves, very interesting.];W[fo]LB[dq:a][cq:b][cr:c]C[W34 is not good, here Chang Hao has miscalculated. White should simply attach at 'a', next B 'b' and W 'c'.];B[fn];W[eo];B[en]C[B37 is a strong move!];W[do]
;B[co];W[cp];B[dq];W[hq];B[dn]C[B43 is also a calm move.];W[ip];B[gp];W[eq];B[cr];W[dr];B[er];W[cq];B[ds]
;W[ep];B[dr];W[br];B[ap]C[And together with the clever move of B55, locally White's corner is completely dead, Black on the outside is also thick as iron, White incurs a huge loss!];W[bq];B[fr];W[gq];B[bs];W[in];B[nq];W[oq];B[np];W[pn]
;B[kq]LB[kp:a]C[B65 is a careless move, to play at 'a' is relatively better.];W[kp];B[lp];W[jq]C[White initiates a ko alertly with W66 and W68! Here comes another big wave.];B[ko];W[kr];B[jp];W[jo];B[qq];W[or];B[jn]
;W[kp];B[fi];W[kn]LB[lq:a]C[W78 is a bad move! White should take cleanly at 'a', this way White's moyo at the bottom is impressive, White can fight adequately.];B[jp];W[jm];B[jr];W[kp];B[qo];W[po];B[jp];W[iq];B[lr]C[Through B87, Black makes life inside White's territory by using the ko threat at 83, Black takes a little advantage, and Black simplifies the situation, the game is still to Black's advantage.]
;W[fh];B[qn]C[After this move, it is time for lunch break.];W[qp];B[rp];W[rq];B[rr];W[qm];B[qg];W[rm];B[sq];W[mo];B[no];W[mp]
;B[mq];W[lo];B[nr];W[qc]C[W104 is a local tesuji.]
(;B[pd]LB[pc:a][rd:b][rc:c][qe:d][rf:e][pe:f]C[B105 is not good, Black should bump at 'a', next W 'b', B 'c' W 'd', B105, W 'e' and B 'f' (see var a).];W[pb];B[rd];W[ob];B[nb];W[rc]LB[mb:a]C[After White blocks with W110, since White is favorable in ko threats and White also has the tactic of playing clamp at 'a', White's corner is alive for the time being.]
;B[qj];W[kp];B[lq];W[jc];B[gh]C[Black cuts with B115, aiming at the aji in the corner, White is difficult to handle.];W[bg]LB[fj:a][cg:b]C[The original move of W116 is to atari at 'a', but this way Black will take advantage. White wants to probe Black with W116, if Black connects at 'b', the eye shape for this group will disappear.];B[bj]C[But Black counterattacks strongly with B117.];W[eg];B[df];W[gg]
;B[bk]LB[fj:a]C[Through B121, after the exchange, White incurs a big loss in territory. With W116 White should tolerate at 'a'.];W[nc]C[W122: White starts to fight desperately.];B[mc];W[nd];B[lb];W[me];B[kc];W[jb];B[le];W[lf];B[om]
;W[ro];B[rk];W[pk];B[pj];W[ok];B[qk];W[pl];B[ke];W[mg];B[id];W[sd];B[se];W[sb]C[And White also uses the special tactic of making ko with W142 and W144, but since White is way behind in territory earlier on, Black only needs to make life, White is in a losing situation.]
