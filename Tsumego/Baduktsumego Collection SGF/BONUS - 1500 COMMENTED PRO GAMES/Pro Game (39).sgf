;W[hq];B[oq];W[cn];B[fc];W[cf];B[db]C[Through B11, the opening is same as game 1.];W[hc]C[W12: White starts to vary, the interesting thing is, yesterday, Luo Xihe took White and also used this move.
];B[cc];W[ec];B[eb];W[fd];B[gd]
;W[gc];B[fb];W[ge]C[Through W20, it is a common joseki. In the process, with W14 White can also simply press at 16, next B14 and W17.];B[dr];W[eq]LB[cq:a][ep:b][fo:c]C[W22: White again elects to take influence, if White makes diagonal at 3-3, Black can make diagonal at 'b' or jump out at 'c'.];B[er];W[fp];B[gq]LB[cp:a][co:b][bp:c][fr:d]C[B25 is a good move, if Black attaches at 'a', next W 'b', B 'c' and W 'd', Black can't be satisfied.]
;W[gp];B[hr];W[ir];B[cp];W[co];B[dq];W[ep];B[bp];W[bd];B[bc];W[gr];B[fr];W[hs]C[Through W38, the local variation comes to an end, the game configuration is very clear, White takes influence and Black takes territory, in my memory in this kind of situation both players are very skillful.]
;B[dj]LB[ej:a]C[Black invades deeply with B39, Black can also consider to play at 'a'.];W[br];B[bq];W[bo];B[ar];W[ej]LB[fj:a][cl:b][el:c]C[W44: The first feeling is to cap at 'a', next B 'b' and W 'c'.];B[dk];W[ek]C[The play of W44 and W46 are very like Luo Xihe's style, and it is hard to judge whether they are good or bad.]
;B[cl];W[el];B[ch];W[di];B[ci]C[Through B51, I feel Black can be satisfied.];W[nc];B[qf];W[ne];B[ei]C[B55 is an asking move, the purpose is to make the left side group live more clearly.];W[dh];B[dg];W[eh]
;B[cg];W[eg];B[df];W[cd];B[mg]C[B63 is ladder breaker.];W[hd];B[ee];W[ed];B[og]LB[ac:a][bb:b]C[Through B67, Black is smooth and not bad for the whole game, the only uncomfortable place is, there are very small points in the upper-left corner, if W 'a', Black can only answer at 'b'.];W[pl]
;B[oc];W[nb];B[pj];W[qn];B[lf]C[B69 and B73: Black takes advantage in sente, it is very obvious White is difficult to give a play to his thickness on the board.];W[kd];B[ro]LB[lq:a]C[B75 is a territory-oriented move, Black can also consider to make two-space extension at 'a'.];W[nk]C[Today both sides play very fast, nobody wants to enter into byo-yomi very earlier on.];B[nn]C[B77: Black aims to crosscut.
];W[mq]LB[mm:a]C[W78: White normally will make the knight at 'a', Lee Changho perhaps feels his situation is not so good and needs be more positive.]
;B[ol]LB[mm:a]C[B79: For Black to attack at 'a' is also not bad.];W[om]LB[ok:a][pk:b][nl:c]C[W80: If White blocks at 'a', then B 'b', W80 and B 'c', this way White is also not good.];B[nl];W[nm];B[mm];W[ok];B[ml];W[pk]
;B[pm]LB[qj:a][on:b][no:c][mk:d]C[B87: If Black descends at 'a', then W 'b', B 'c' and W 'd', Black can't be satisfied.];W[qm];B[on];W[qj];B[qi];W[pi];B[rj];W[oj];B[qh]
;W[rk]C[The sequence up to W96 is inevitable for both sides, Black incurs some loss in territory but simplifies the situation, Black still keeps a small advantage.];B[kp];W[kq];B[lp];W[lq];B[ob]C[B101 is the biggest endgame on the board.];W[ac];B[bb];W[bm];B[bl];W[dl];B[bf]LB[bj:a]C[If B107 is omitted, White can strike at 'a', Black is not alive.]
;W[km];B[ln]C[B109 is a steady move.];W[jn];B[ip];W[ho]C[W110 and W112: White starts to enclose the middle territory.];B[jj]C[The selected point of B113 is not bad, the game enters into the final endgame, since the difference is small, every move is very important.];W[ij];B[ii];W[ji]C[W114 and W116 are good moves, Black is a little difficult to handle.];B[ld];W[lc]
;B[kc]C[B117 and B119: Black tries to find some threads.];W[pe];B[qe];W[od];B[pc];W[le];B[ke];W[md];B[jd];W[ld];B[fi]C[B129 is a good move.];W[gh]LB[ff:a]C[W130: Here comes Black's chance, with W130 for White to make diagonal at 'a' is relatively steady.]
;B[jh];W[ki]LB[fh:a][fg:b][gi:c][hh:d][gg:e][gf:f][ih:g][hg:h][hi:i]C[After W132, Black can push at 'a', next W 'b', B 'c', W 'd' and B 'e', White is difficult to handle.

Next if White plays atari at 'f', then B 'b', if White 'h', then B 'i', White has two ways to play atari.

After this move, it is time for lunch break.];B[hi]LB[fh:a]C[B133 is steady, after study, If Black pushes at 'a', the variation is complicated.]
;W[ik];B[gi];W[ff];B[ig];W[kf];B[kh];W[je]C[Through W140, both sides are roughly acceptable, looking back White's attachment of W114 is successful.];B[li];W[kj];B[lj];W[kk];B[gk];W[gl]
;B[ri]LB[oi:a]C[B147 is sente, next B 'a' can kill White.];W[oh];B[nr]C[B149 is the biggest point on the board, now Luo's situation is a little unfavorable, with B133 Black's play is not relentless enough.];W[pg];B[lk];W[ll];B[mk];W[qd]C[W154: White exploits in endgame, White has more ko threats.];B[pf]C[B155: If Black retreats, Black will have no chance any more.];W[of]
;B[oe];W[cj];B[ck];W[pe];B[qc];W[rd];B[oe];W[bj];B[bi];W[pe];B[qg];W[rc];B[rb]
;W[qb]C[W168 and W170 are tesujis.];B[qa];W[ra];B[sa];W[sb]LB[oa:a]C[W172 and W174 are the most vicious moves but White takes a very big risk. With W172 White still should atari at 'a', but this way the cut of W154 is not to White's advantage.];B[sc];W[sd];B[pb];W[sb];B[oe];W[ra]
;B[nf]C[B181 is inevitable, this way the corner forms a ko, this ko will decide the game.];W[qb];B[ni];W[oi];B[rb];W[af];B[be];W[qb];B[io]C[B189 is a ko threat.];W[in];B[rb];W[ab]
;B[gb];W[hb];B[ae];W[qb];B[hn]C[B197 is a good move, now the situation is very chaotic, I feel Luo Xihe has a chance.

B197 creating ko threats is the winning move.];W[hp];B[rb];W[ad];B[ba];W[qb];B[hl];W[hk];B[rb]

;B[ih];W[qb];B[fl]C[Now the ko-threat situation is very complicated, and it is very difficult to judge, I'm also looking into ......];W[hm];B[rb];W[ga];B[fa];W[qb];B[rl]LB[jq:a]C[B227: Black should first find the ko threat at 'a'.];W[sk];B[rb]

;W[qb];B[rm];W[rl];B[rb];W[qr]C[W272: White has to play damaging ko threat.];B[po];W[qb];B[jq];W[jr];B[rb]C[Black likely will win.];W[op];B[np]
;W[qb];B[na]LB[em:a]C[B281: Black should first play hane at 'a', forcing White to find damaging ko threats.];W[pa];B[la];W[kb];B[gm]C[After the atari of B285, Black basically can take down this game!];W[qa];B[oa];W[gn];B[hl];W[fm]
;B[ie];W[if];B[jf];W[jg];B[hf];W[jf];B[kg];W[ke];B[ef];W[fg];B[he];W[id];B[hg]C[Lou Xihe is really a ko "King"!]
;W[fk];B[ha]C[Looking back, W172 electing to play a ko is the losing move.];W[mb];B[ma];W[lb];B[nd];W[fs];B[cr];W[od];B[fe];W[gf];B[nd];W[jo]
;B[jp];W[od];B[ib];W[ka];B[nd];W[pn];B[oo];W[od];B[ia];W[jc];B[nd]C[Today Luo Xihe's state is not bad, he plays very steadily in the second half of the game.];W[me];B[mr]
