Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[In the semi final of this Tianyuan title, these two "old" opponents Kong Jie 7p and Hu Yaoyu 7p were involved in a big fight, in the end Kong Jie luckily advanced to the next round. In the morning, they only played a total of 19 moves, this is a record, I'm afraid.];W[dc];B[pq];W[dp];B[ce]
;W[oc];B[ld];W[po];B[pc];W[dh]C[B9 and W10: Each side plays on their own, nobody wants to fall behind in momentum.];B[pl];W[qj]C[The counter-pincer of W12 is Kong Jie's favorite move, he often uses it.];B[qm];W[qg];B[od]LB[pf:a][pg:b][og:c]C[B15 is loose, Black should make the knight's move at 'a' to tangle with White, next W 'b' and B 'c', overall won't allow White to take tenuki easily.]
;W[oq]C[The attachment of W16 is a good move!];B[op]LB[or:a][pr:b]C[B17: If Black plays the hane at 'a', White has the tesuji of playing the cut at 'b', because the tempo of B11 and B13 is slow, White turns his body around and can be happy. In the game, after a long consideration, Black still doesn't have assurance of success with the counterattack of B17.];W[pp];B[qq]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.];W[or];B[oo];W[on];B[nn];W[pn];B[nm]
;W[rp];B[rq];W[qp];B[pr];W[sr]C[W30 is a classic tesuji, Black sinks into a difficult situation.];B[rr];W[mq]LB[sq:a][mp:b][mr:c][qs:d][lq:e]C[But next W32 is clearly miscalculation! White should play at 'a', next B 'b', W 'c', B 'd' and W 'e', in the corner it is two-step ko, White takes advantage.];B[mp]
;W[qs];B[lq];W[mr];B[sp]C[White strikes with W34, when B37, White suddenly goes into deep thinking.];W[so]LB[ps:a][sn:b]C[Because if W38 at 'a', Black will have a clever move at 'b' to cross over! White will die unconditionally. White has no other choice but to block at 38, in the corner White has a two-step ko, as a result White incurs loss.];B[sq];W[ro];B[ps];W[rs];B[kp]
;W[os];B[ss];W[np];B[no];W[sr];B[pi];W[qr];B[qi]C[B51: After the exchange, Black's configuration is ideal, Black is favorable.];W[cd];B[cn]LB[de:a]C[B53: Black can extend at 'a' and fight.];W[de]
;B[fp];W[bp];B[id]LB[fo:a][en:b]C[B57 is certainly very big, but the value of sticking the head out at 'a' also can't be underestimated. With B57 it seems Black should play at 'b'.];W[fo];B[go];W[eo];B[gn];W[fm];B[cj];W[lo];B[lp]
;W[gp];B[hp];W[gq];B[hq];W[gr];B[hl]LB[mg:a][kh:b]C[B71 is a big questionable move! After White reduces at 'a', Black's advantage disappears. The direction of B71 should at the top, there is just Black's precious property. If Black plays at 'b' to wait, because the moyo is huge, White still has to reduce, this way if Black starts to attack, Black would be more favorable.];W[mg];B[og];W[jg];B[hr];W[cl]
;B[cq];W[cp];B[eq];W[fq];B[dl];W[dm];B[hg]C[In the game, Black's attack of B83 is one step slow, White not only wants to live but also live inside Black's territory.];W[ji];B[hi];W[je];B[jd];W[ke];B[kd]

;B[pj];W[me];B[le];W[lf];B[md];W[rf]C[W96 and W108 all strikes at Black's vital points, Black wants to kill but can't, Black is very painful.];B[of];W[rh];B[ri];W[ng];B[qh];W[pg];B[nj]
;W[oj];B[ok];W[mj];B[mk];W[si];B[rj];W[rd]C[After W122, White basically lives completely, Black's attack fails, the situation is to White's advantage.];B[rc];W[re];B[gs];W[ep];B[fr];W[fp]
;B[dq]LB[df:a]C[B129 is the last losing move! Black should play at 'a', this way Black still can hope to win the game in the endgame.];W[er];B[fs];W[ch]TR[cj]C[With W132, White not only protects his side territory but makes the marked black stone thin, thin and weak stones are going to pay price sooner or later.];B[dk];W[cm];B[fc];W[nd];B[nc];W[ne]
;B[rb];W[lg];B[jk];W[br]LB[fk:a]C[W142: If White directly plays at 'a', Black at the bottom is already very dangerous.];B[eb];W[es];B[hs];W[cs]C[In the game, White captures back with the tesuji of W146, White has nothing to complain.];B[cb]C[Because Black's territory is not adequate, Black grabs territory desperately with B147, but White is too thick!];W[db];B[df]

;B[gc];W[fg]C[White also takes some advantage with W156 and W164, Black's territory is still inadequate.];B[if]LB[hj:a]C[B165 is an overplay, the original move is to reinforce at 'a'.];W[ob];B[pb];W[ij]C[The counterattack of W168 is severe! Although Black pulls through a crisis, but Black is damaging in territory again, White wins the game for sure.];B[hj];W[ik];B[kh];W[gh];B[gi]
