;W[hc];B[oc];W[qk]LB[po:a]C[W8: White varies a little bit, in the past, Lee Changho most likely will approach at 'a'. In the real game, Black can protect two corners and can't be satisfied.];B[qo];W[qh];B[do];W[co];B[cn];W[cp];B[cf]C[B15 playing double approach is better than directly entering the corner, White is not thick.];W[fd]

;W[eq];B[ho]C[Black's sequence from B25 to B31 is territory-damaging.];W[ip];B[hj]C[But Black gets to cap with B33 and starts to attack.];W[ch]LB[fe:a]C[W34 is a little questionable. I feel White should double at 'a', waiting for one move and eliminating the aji at the top, then try to make life on the left side. White is not easy to get killed.];B[gd]C[The hane of B35 is the follow-up tactic of the thick turn of B27, it is severe!];W[gc];B[fb]C[B37 is a common tactic.];W[db]LB[fe:a]C[W38: White normally doubles up at 'a', allowing Black to cross over at 38, this way White first incurs loss in territory and White's outside is also not thick. In the real game, Lee Changho elects to play nimbly, although Black obtains a lot of territory, but White's outside becomes much thicker.]
;B[ed];W[fe];B[ee];W[ef];B[ec];W[ff];B[gb];W[hb];B[cb];W[he];B[hl]LB[mq:a][io:b][jp:c]C[B49 is a little slow, Choi Cheolhan feels his situation is not bad. Black should make two-space extension at 'a', or Black can first press at 'b', after White retreats at 'c', then Black can make two-space extension at 'a'.]
;W[mq]C[W50 is a very big move.];B[qm]C[B51 is also very valuable, now if White makes extension here, Black's corner may be exploited terribly.];W[io]C[W52 is a thick move.];B[qf];W[mc];B[rj];W[qj];B[rk]C[Through B57, the situation is about even.];W[hn]LB[me:a]C[The play of W58 is too early. I feel White should jump to 'a' to expand White's moyo on the left side and look after White's several stones on the right side. ];B[gn]
;W[hm];B[gm];W[gl];B[ek]LB[gk:a]C[B63: Black can't directly play atari at 'a', otherwise White can extend out all the way to the first line, Black can't tolerate. Black first strikes with B63 and make some preparation, the following sequence is one way street, Black obtains side territory, White cuts Black's several stones.];W[fl];B[il];W[jm];B[dk];W[gj];B[ej];W[ei];B[di]
;W[eh];B[hi]C[After this move, it is time for lunch break.];W[dh];B[cj];W[lj]LB[kk:a][ki:b][kg:c]C[W76: White should consider to attack with the knight's move at 'a', next B 'b' and W 'c', keeping attack posture, this will be an even situation. In the real game, W76 appears a both defensive and offensive play, but it is White's wishful thinking.];B[kk]C[Black simply escapes following B77, White only encloses a superficial moyo.];W[lk];B[kj];W[li]
;B[ll];W[ml];B[gh];W[fh];B[km];W[jn];B[mm];W[nl];B[nm];W[qc];B[pd];W[om];B[on]
;W[ol];B[no];W[ob]LB[ln:a][lm:b]C[W96 is the losing move! White should peep at 'a' to force Black connect at 'b', this way White guards against Black's invasion at the top in sente. Following W96, Black's counterattack is inevitable, later on Choi Cheolhan handles simply and continues to make himself thick, aiming at White's thinness in the middle and invade at the bottom.];B[nb];W[pb];B[nc];W[rb];B[rd];W[rc];B[oh];W[ql]
;B[rl];W[pm];B[pn];W[me];B[id];W[hd];B[lc];W[ga];B[da];W[mb];B[md];W[ld];B[nd]
;W[na];B[le];W[kd];B[ke];W[jd];B[nj]C[Black makes himself thick by sacrificing.];W[jl];B[kl];W[oi];B[ni];W[oj];B[ph];W[nh]
;B[mh];W[ng];B[mg];W[nf];B[of];W[mi];B[ne];W[nk];B[mf];W[mj];B[kq]C[B141 is very severe!];W[lp];B[kp]
;W[ko];B[lo];W[mo];B[ln];W[mr];B[jr];W[or]LB[ir:a]C[W150: White can attach at 'a' and kill Black by one liberty, but Black will enclose all outside territory, White can't tolerate. White delivers the last-ditch effort with W150.];B[ir]LB[hr:a][hq:b]C[After B151, White can't continue. Now if White attaches at 'a', Black can wedge at 'b', White will collapse, since White can only turn at 'b', but this way Black will kill White by one liberty. Lee Changho simply concedes defeat.

The final game 3 will take place on 2/11.])
