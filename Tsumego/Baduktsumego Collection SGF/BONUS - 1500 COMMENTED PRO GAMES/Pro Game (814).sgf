Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[pd]C[In this game, Kong Jie leads all the way until the end, due to one mistake, the situation had been turned around, it is a pity.];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[qk]
;W[jp];B[cn];W[fq];B[ck];W[fc];B[nc];W[mq];B[po];W[ci];B[bp];W[lc]C[The opening is very steady, through W16, Black's big komi will be a burden.];B[gd];W[fd]
;B[ge];W[id]LB[hb:a]C[W20 is positive, the common move is to make the knight at 'a'.];B[gc];W[if];B[gg];W[ih]C[White perhaps wants to reduce Black's "Chinese Fuseki" on the right side by using two jumps of W22 and W24.];B[cf]LB[gi:a]C[B25: The original move is to jump at 'a'.];W[ef];B[ic]
;W[jc];B[jd]C[The play of B25, B27 and B29 is very far-fetched. First, after B25 is being separated, Black has no follow-up tactic. Then Black separates White strongly and makes himself an inefficient shape, Black completely has no assurance of success in the fight.];W[je];B[kd];W[ib];B[hc];W[kc];B[ke];W[nd];B[od];W[md];B[kf];W[nf]
;B[kh];W[eh];B[gi];W[hh]LB[ij:a][gh:b]C[W44: White can also simply jump to 'a', White may make himself heavy after the exchange of W44 and B 'b'.];B[gh];W[ij];B[nh];W[pf];B[ph];W[qh];B[qi]
;W[ob]C[The strike of W52 is a good move.];B[pb];W[nb];B[oc];W[mb]LB[qb:a]C[White makes life himself and Black's corner is still left with the clamp at 'a'.];B[ei];W[di];B[ej];W[cd]C[W60: White again takes advantage, it is very relentless!];B[il]C[White is completely leading in territory, Black still perhaps can't capture White's several stones in the middle.]
;W[pg]LB[rd:a]C[The timing of W62 is just right. If Black captures White's several stones in the center, White will capture the corner at 'a', Black's territory is still not enough.];B[rh];W[qg];B[qe];W[jk]C[Black strengthens the corner and needs one more move on the outside, White escapes again with W66, Black can't capture White.];B[km];W[lk];B[oi];W[lg]C[White's sequence following W70 is very simple and clear.];B[mg];W[lh]
;B[lf];W[kg];B[jg];W[li];B[jf];W[jh]C[Through W78, White makes life with 6 points, White is already in a winning trend.];B[hq];W[jr]C[As to the invasion of B79, following W80 White handles very properly, Black can't exert any power and Black's territory is clearly inadequate.];B[iq];W[jq];B[io];W[cq]

;W[pr];B[qr];W[nq];B[ps];W[ns];B[ar];W[dr];B[bs];W[cr];B[kl]C[B107: Black again ends in gote, Black's situation deteriorates, now only if White doesn't die, Black is difficult to have any chance.];W[hf];B[fe];W[cg]
;B[mj];W[kk];B[eo];W[do];B[dn];W[ep];B[ee];W[df];B[fb];W[db];B[hb];W[mk]C[Through W122, it should be complete victory for White. However, in the following several moves, Kong Jie is being overturned.];B[ri]
;W[om];B[on];W[nm];B[pm];W[qq];B[qp];W[rq];B[rr];W[pl]LB[nn:a]C[First, W132 is unnecessary, if White turns at 'a', Lee Sedol can only concede defeat.];B[nn];W[qm]LB[ql:a][qn:b]C[Next W134 is a big crude move! White should simply push at 'a', since White can strike at 'b', Black can't separate White, White is fine.]
;B[pn];W[ql];B[lr];W[mr]LB[mo:a][mn:b][nk:c]C[The last losing move is W138, White should jump to 'a', next B 'b', White can take tenuki and strengthen at 'c', afterwards it is seki at most, White still wins big.];B[lp]C[After Black takes advantage in sente with B139, ...];W[lq];B[ok];W[ol];B[ml]C[..., the cut of B141 and B143 is working.]
