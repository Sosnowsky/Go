;W[cf];B[od]C[B7 simply protecting the corner is novel.];W[ic];B[lc];W[ec];B[hd];W[id];B[he];W[kd]C[Through W14, it forms a rare situation.];B[hg];W[if];B[fe]
;W[me];B[nc];W[ig];B[hh];W[ih];B[hi];W[jj]C[As for the result up to W24, most players think White is better.];B[dg];W[df];B[ef];W[cg];B[dh];W[po]
;B[qo]LB[mg:a]C[The attachment of B31 is biased to one corner and questionable in terms of the whole game. Black should play at 'a', White's shape is defective and Black must take advantage of it.];W[qn];B[qp];W[pn];B[nq];W[pi];B[ch];W[qe]C[W36 and W38 are correlated moves.];B[pe];W[qf];B[rd]
;W[of]C[Through W42, White's defect in the shape disappears automatically, White is favorable for the game.];B[cn];W[fq];B[mn];W[nn];B[mm]LB[mo:a]C[B47: Black must play like this in order to have a chance to win, if retreating at 'a', Black will lose the game easily.];W[mo];B[lo];W[mp];B[jm];W[mk]
;B[nl];W[nk];B[ol];W[mq];B[np];W[no];B[jp];W[rn];B[pk];W[rq];B[rp];W[qr];B[or]LB[sr:a][oq:b]C[B65 again is a game-deciding move, although Black can live cleanly by playing at 'a', but White has the good wedge at 'b' and can capture two black stones in sente, this way Black's situation will deteriorate quickly.]
;W[ko];B[kp];W[ln];B[lm];W[lp];B[jo];W[sr];B[rs];W[sp];B[so];W[ro];B[sq]C[Through B77, Black's corner becomes ko-die, although Black is dangerous, but Black still have a chance.];W[in]
;B[jn];W[sp];B[ep]LB[cc:a]C[B81 is the right ko threat. If Black strikes at 3-3, White can ignore, Black has no chance.];W[sn];B[eq]C[Black pushes down with B83, White is a little difficult to handle.];W[kl];B[km];W[dq];B[er]LB[dr:a]C[B87 is a good calm move, if Black plays hane at 'a', White has a good move of cutting at 87 and can easily dodge himself.]
;W[do];B[kr];W[lr];B[bp]C[After B91, White can't find an easy and clear move to make life for now.];W[eo]LB[dn:a][cm:b][bq:c]C[The sequence following W92 is Zhou Heyang's choice, although it is damaging to territory, White can ensure living a small group. If White presses at 'a', next B 'b' and W 'c', this way White has a high percentage of making life, but White indeed also takes some risk.];B[fp];W[fo];B[gp];W[bo]
;B[co];W[cp];B[bq];W[bn];B[cm];W[bm];B[cl];W[bl];B[cr];W[ck];B[el];W[bj];B[bh]LB[dk:a][dj:b][ej:c][ik:d]C[B109 is miscalculation and the losing move of this game. If Black hangs at 'a', next W 'b', B 'c', W109 and B 'd', if entering the endgame this way, Black still can continue.]
;W[dj]LB[fk:a]C[W110: For White to play at 'a' is more severe.];B[fm];W[fk];B[ek];W[ej];B[fj];W[gk];B[gm];W[be]C[W118 is a decisive good move, one stone for two birds! White fixes two defects, Black has no way out.];B[ik];W[hj]
;B[fi];W[ij];B[bd]C[Following B123, Black seeks a breakthrough.];W[cd];B[ae];W[bg];B[eb];W[fd];B[gd];W[ed];B[gb];W[db];B[da]
;W[ca];B[ea];W[ee];B[eg]C[But through B137 Black unexpectedly ends in gote and will lose the game for sure.];W[pf];B[cb];W[bb];B[ba];W[bc];B[oj];W[ml];B[qi];W[ph]
