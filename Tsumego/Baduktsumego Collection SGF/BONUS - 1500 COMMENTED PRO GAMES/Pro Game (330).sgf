Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[In the first game of 2005 China-Korea New Pro confrontation, Gu Li 7p takes White and plays against Park YuongHoon 9p.];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[fc]
;W[cf];B[kc];W[po]C[As to Black's "mini-Chinese", the high approach of W8 is the most popular play, Gu Li especially likes it.];B[qm];W[ro];B[np];W[on];B[kq]LB[qj:a]C[B13 is the most recent study, the common move is to make two-space extension at 'a'.];W[pl]LB[qk:a][qi:b]C[W14: White can also pincer at 'a', next B 'b' and W14.]
;B[qp];W[qo];B[pj];W[ql]C[It is hard to judge the set pattern up to W18. The opening through W18 is exactly same as the one in one CSK game between Park YuongHoon and Kong Jie.];B[od];W[hc];B[cn];W[cl];B[fq];W[dn];B[cq];W[cp];B[dq]
;W[ep];B[bq];W[dc]LB[bp:a]C[W30: White can also consider to block at 'a'.];B[bp];W[co]C[W32: White has no other choice but feels a little wronged.];B[he];W[gd];B[je]LB[rj:a][jd:b][kd:c]C[B35 is questionable. Black should jump to 'a', it is huge! If White flies out at 'b', Black can attach at 'c', Black has nothing to fear of.]
;W[qc]C[White starts to strike first on the right side following W36, White takes the initiative.
];B[pc];W[qe];B[rc];W[ph];B[rj];W[ni];B[rl];W[qi];B[qj];W[nk];B[rh]LB[oh:a]C[B47: Black wants to attach out at 'a' and fight, with the play in the game Black really feels wronged.]
;W[pf];B[re];W[ne];B[le];W[ge]C[Through W52, White is smooth and happy.];B[gf];W[hf];B[gg]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.];W[ig];B[ih];W[kf];B[dm]
;W[cm];B[bn];W[bo];B[jh];W[jf];B[lf]C[Black's sequence following B65 is surprising, Black sacrifices considerable territory and puts emphasis on White's left-side thinness. This is Park YuongHoon's extraordinary talent of taking the whole game into account.];W[ke];B[lg];W[kd];B[ld];W[lc];B[hg];W[mc]
;B[if];W[jd];B[nd];W[kb];B[id];W[jc]C[Through W78, White obtains a lot of territory and should have nothing to complain.];B[oi];W[nh];B[li];W[pm]LB[ok:a][rm:b]C[W82 is questionable, this is White's main losing cause in this game. White should double at 'a' to ensure connection, next to cut at 'b' directly will work. This way White is not thin and Black is very hard to enclose a big territory. With W82 White probably tries to achieve high efficiency but White overlooks Black's strong moves.]
;B[nj]C[The wedge of B83 is a good move, White is difficult to answer.];W[mj];B[ok];W[oj];B[en];W[an];B[nj];W[md]C[W90: White connects by a dame very painfully.];B[nl];W[oj];B[do];W[bm]
;B[nj];W[mk];B[ml];W[ol];B[oj];W[mi];B[mn];W[rm];B[oh];W[ng];B[kk];W[lh];B[kh]
;W[me]C[Through W108, White obtains a thick wall for free.];B[fp]C[After Black attaches up with B109, Black's moyo is very magnificent. Black establishes his superiority.];W[rf];B[pg];W[qg];B[og]LB[qh:a]C[B113: If Black plays atari at 'a', Black can live cleanly but is wronged. Black is reluctant to retreat in the game but here left a ko fight and it is a very big suspense.];W[kp];B[lq];W[ll]C[W114 and W116: White aims to create ko threats.];B[qh]C[B117: Black strengthens himself and it is good judgment. Now the situation is indeed to Black's advantage.]
;W[lm];B[ch];W[dn];B[eo];W[dl];B[em];W[cj];B[ef];W[io];B[iq];W[dg];B[dh];W[eg]
;B[eh];W[fg];B[fh];W[ff];B[bf];W[be];B[kn]C[B137: Black finally strikes, White's big dragon is very dangerous.];W[ln];B[lo];W[ko];B[jn];W[lp];B[mo]
;W[mp];B[mq]LB[no:a][nq:b][mr:c][jq:d]C[B145: Black can consider to connect at 'a', next W145, B 'b', W 'c' and B 'd', this way White is almost dead.];W[jo];B[no];W[im];B[lk];W[jm];B[mm];W[gn]LB[hl:a]C[W152 is alert! To capture two stones, Black can strike at 'a', then White is very difficult to make life.]
;B[gm];W[gl];B[km]C[B155: Black elects to back up, Black doesn't gain must profit in the attack, but now the situation is still Black's small-margin victory.];W[fl];B[fm];W[el];B[go]LB[fo:a]C[The shape of B159 is not right, Black should simply connect at 'a', comparing to the real game, there is a difference of about 2 points.];W[hm];B[cg];W[df];B[rp]C[However Black gets to block with B163, the game is still slightly to Black's advantage.]
;W[sp];B[sq]C[In the following endgame, Gu Li plays very tenaciously, but Park YuongHoon doesn't make any mistake. ];W[so];B[rq];W[hq];B[rk];W[sm];B[gr];W[ho];B[gp];W[hp];B[hr];W[ob]
