Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[Since this is 30-seconds-per-move fast game, the quality of game is not so good, just because of this, the game appears brilliant. In this game against Luo Xihe 9p, Zhou Ruiyang 3p was once in an unfavorable situation, but the young Zhou Ruiyang showed very calm in the crucial moments and finally turned the game around, it is really worth praising.];W[dc];B[dp];W[pp];B[ce]
;W[oc];B[ed];W[ec];B[fd]C[B7 and B9 pressing White are momentum, in fast games, this kind of momentum is very important.];W[gc];B[gd];W[hc];B[hd];W[id];B[ie];W[je];B[fc];W[fb]
;B[eb];W[gb];B[jd];W[ic];B[if]LB[cc:a]C[B23: If Black plays at 'a' first, White definitely will play at 23, Black has no advantage to take.];W[cc]C[The value of W24 is big.];B[ke];W[cj];B[cl];W[cg]LB[dh:a]C[W28: After Black seals the head at 'a', White is not comfortable, to play at 'a' is better.]
;B[dh];W[ch];B[dj];W[di];B[ei];W[ci];B[ej];W[ck];B[dl];W[jq];B[pc]LB[jf:a]C[B39 is a smart move, aiming to pin down White's escape at 'a'.];W[od]
;B[pf];W[kc]C[W40 and W42: White certainly doesn't want to play less valuable moves, but it seems there are also no other good plays.];B[qk];W[qn];B[dg]LB[ef:a]C[B45 is big! Black seals off White in sente, so with the earlier W44, White should stick the head out at 'a'.];W[bl];B[bm];W[al];B[ok]C[B49: Black expands his situation, it is a good move, Black is leading in the opening. However, as to fast games, this kind of advantage is almost nothing.];W[nf];B[pr]
;W[nr]LB[nq:a]C[W52: White feels his situation is not good, by theory, White should play at 'a' to make himself thick.];B[oq];W[qq];B[qr]LB[nq:a]C[B55: Black should press at 'a', now to stick the head out is important and it is not time to snatch away the base.];W[mq];B[op];W[oo];B[no];W[on];B[mp]
;W[pj];B[pk];W[nm];B[hq];W[ph];B[ml]LB[mk:a]C[B67: For Black to jump at 'a' is better.];W[mm];B[ko];W[ll]C[In the real game, White also has no other choice but to play hane of W70, it leads to a big chaotic fight.];B[io];W[pd]C[W72 is a good move locally!]
;B[ir]LB[qf:a]C[B73: As to W72, Black surely won't answer, so Black takes tenuki. Now the key for the situation is in the upper right corner, for Black to play at 'a' is better.];W[qe]C[W74: White gains a lot of profit in sente.];B[qf];W[re];B[rh];W[fq];B[rf]LB[eq:a]C[As to the probe of W78, Black doesn't know how to answer and takes tenuki with W79, for Black to make diagonal at 'a' is relatively better.];W[jr];B[eq]
;W[hp]LB[er:a]C[W82: White should first play hane at 'a', White's sequence in the game is damaging.];B[ip];W[er];B[fp];W[dq];B[ep];W[gr];B[gq];W[fr];B[cq];W[hr];B[iq]
;W[is];B[dr];W[es];B[pe];W[qc];B[rd];W[rc];B[se]C[Through B101, each side has saved one of their dead groups, it looks brilliant. After the exchange, Black is still favorable.];W[bn];B[kk];W[lk];B[cm];W[am]
;B[kj];W[cn];B[rp]C[B109 is severe! White's big group is being exploited, the situation is severe.];W[rq];B[rn];W[rm];B[qo];W[sn]C[W114: White has no way to back up and can only initiate a ko.];B[so];W[ro];B[hs];W[gs]
;B[rn];W[qm]C[W120 is a calm move, White has no enough ko threats, only this way White may still have a chance.];B[sm];W[po];B[rl];W[nk];B[kl];W[km];B[jm];W[lg]LB[ol:a]C[W128 is an overplay, the original move is to strengthen at 'a' to make life.];B[mi]C[B129: Black exploits White, White incurs loss.]
;W[ol];B[nj];W[lj];B[li];W[mj];B[kh];W[dk]C[When W136, although White's situation is not good, but Zhou Ruiyang shows some confident in playing, it is rarely seen.];B[ek];W[el];B[fl];W[em];B[fm];W[og]
;B[kn];W[lm];B[ne]LB[me:a]C[Perhaps Luo Xihe is confusing, B145 is te losing move! After W 'a', Black has no tactic and incurs loss. Black should play at 'a', this way Black is a little favorable in endgame.];W[me];B[kd];W[lc];B[en];W[lp];B[lo];W[kg];B[mf]C[B153: It seems Black wants to redeem the loss caused by B145.]
;W[le]C[But with W154, White is not soft-hearted and starts to counterattack, at the end Black just couldn't kill White.];B[ng];W[of];B[lf];W[mg];B[kf];W[jg];B[jf];W[nh];B[oe];W[ni];B[oj];W[oi]
