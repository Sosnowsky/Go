;W[gq];B[fc];W[cf];B[db];W[nc];B[oc]LB[lc:a]C[The diagonal bump of B11 doesn't conform to Go theory, perhaps it is a new try, but it is hard to judge whether it is good or bad, normally with B11 Black will pincer at 'a'.
];W[nd];B[pf];W[hc];B[cc];W[ec];B[eb]
;W[fd];B[fb];W[gd]C[After the pincer of W14, up to W20, White forms a good shape, Black is clearly not favorable.];B[ck];W[cm];B[ch]LB[ek:a]C[B23: For Black to jump at 'a' is probably better.];W[di]C[Although B21 is a splitting move, but White gets to attack with W24, Black is painful.];B[ci];W[dj];B[dh];W[dk]
;B[cl];W[dl];B[bm];W[bn];B[cn];W[dm];B[bo];W[cj];B[cq];W[dq];B[cr];W[cd]C[Through W40, it forms an exchange, it is also not to Black's advantage.];B[bc]LB[mg:a]C[B41: Black exercises patience, hoping to pull out several dead stones, but Black's tempo is too slow, now Black should play the vital point at 'a'.]
;W[lp]LB[ng:a]C[Although W42 is a big point, but now to expand moyo at 'a' is more urgent.];B[id]C[B43: Black finally invades.];W[je]C[W44 is a good move! Forcing Black to walk out inconveniently, Black's shape is already not good.];B[he]LB[ic:a][ie:b]C[B45: If Black blocks at 'a' instead, White will press at 'b', White's moyo is too big, Black is clearly no good.];W[kc];B[ic];W[hb];B[gf]
;W[eh]LB[eg:a]C[As to the small diagonal of B49, W50 is not a good answer, White should make the knight's move at 'a' instead, which is the right move.];B[eg];W[dg];B[fh]C[In the game, Black forms a shape with B51 and B53, this leaves a hidden trouble later on for reducing liberties.];W[ei];B[jg];W[mg];B[ef];W[bd];B[ib];W[le]
;B[kb]LB[mb:a][hd:b][ha:c]C[The purpose of the attachment of B61 is to pincer at 'a', strange! Black should directly squeeze at 'b', then play the hane at 'c'.];W[lb];B[hd];W[gc];B[ha];W[qc];B[pc];W[rf];B[rd];W[qh]
;B[mb];W[nb]C[In the game, W72 is an inevitable counterattack.];B[lc];W[qb]C[The descent of W74 is severe, the situation just became mild, but now Black again sinks into a difficult situation.];B[re];W[qf];B[pe];W[na];B[ph];W[pi];B[oh];W[qj]
;B[oi];W[mi];B[mj];W[oj]LB[li:a][pk:b][rl:c]C[As to the attachment of B85, with W86 White should calmly retreat at 'a', next B 'b' and W 'c', White makes life locally, White's advantage is clear.];B[mh]C[The wedge of B87 is a good move.];W[lh];B[li];W[nh];B[ni]
;W[kh];B[ld];W[kd];B[la];W[me];B[mh];W[ng];B[ql];W[pl];B[pm];W[ol];B[ri];W[rj]LB[qi:a][qk:b]C[W104: White should connect at 'a', next B 'b' and W104, it would be still a bitter battle for Black.]
;B[qi];W[pj];B[qg];W[rh];B[rg];W[si];B[sf]C[In the game, Black captures two stones with B111, Black no longer needs to escape painfully.];W[oq];B[pr];W[og];B[pg];W[kn];B[dr]
;W[hh];B[gb]LB[ge:a][ae:b][aj:c]C[At this juncture, the situation is still to White's advantage, but the road to victory or defeat is still very long, White's fatal mistake is that Black overlooks Black's liberty-tight move of B119! In fact it is very simple, when B 'a', if Black continues to reduce liberty at 'b', White can play the good block move at 'c', this way can extend one more liberty.];W[fr]LB[bj:a]C[W120: If White strengthens by descending at 'a', the game would be still to White's advantage. Yoo Changhyeok's state really worries us.];B[bj];W[bl];B[bf];W[cg];B[bg]
