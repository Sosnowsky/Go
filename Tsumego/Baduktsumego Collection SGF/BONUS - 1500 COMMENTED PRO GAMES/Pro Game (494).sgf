;W[oq]C[W6: Shao Weigang tried this move before in some national games.];B[pp]C[B7 is the most solid answer.];W[kq];B[fq];W[eq];B[fp];W[dn];B[iq];W[jo];B[fn]LB[gn:a]C[B15 is the vital point, otherwise if White seals at 'a', Black is not good.];W[op]
;B[oo];W[no];B[mq]C[B19 is fierce and tough, Black first initiates a fight, the situation becomes complicated instantly, and this is exactly the strong point of Korean players.];W[on];B[po]C[B21: Although Black suffers a little bit, but White's shape is also defective.];W[or];B[lp]LB[np:a][mo:b][el:c]C[B23: if Black directly cuts at 'a', then White can fix his shape by sacrificing with the play at 'b', then knight attack at 'c'.];W[kp]C[Through 24, Yu Bin 9p says he more likes White, Zhou Heyang 9p thinks White has more variations to choose from.]
;B[np];W[mn];B[mo];W[nn];B[ln];W[mr]LB[nq:a][lq:b]C[W30: White has to play this way, if White ataris at 'a', then B 'b', White is no good.];B[lq];W[lr];B[nq];W[nr];B[lm]C[B35: Black sticks his head out, White is hard in reply.]
;W[nl];B[jr];W[kr]C[For the result up to 38, White has some weak stones in the center, Hua Xueming 7p thinks Black is not bad, other pros think the situation is chaotic.];B[ql]C[B39: Black is not hasty to attack White, but first strengthens himself, it's a smart play.];W[ll]LB[lk:a]C[B40 is tighter than the knight's move at 'a', and it also catches Black's weakness of shortage of liberties.];B[mm];W[ml];B[km]LB[jm:a][kn:b]C[B43 looks like a bad shape, in reality it is a good move, if Black simply jumps to 'a', then W 'b' is a ruthless move.]
;W[pl];B[in]C[B45: Black aims to reinforce himself by attacking White.];W[ip];B[hm];W[il];B[jn];W[ko];B[lo];W[qr]LB[hq:a][hr:b][jq:c][ir:d]C[Before White jumps to 52, White should first play the sequence of W 'a', B 'b', W 'c' and B 'd'.]
;B[pk];W[qm];B[rm]C[B55 is a good tesuji, White can not block Black from bridging over.];W[qk];B[rl];W[jk]C[The play of W58 is worth study.];B[ol]C[After B58, White's shape is not good.];W[ok];B[pm];W[pj]C[W60 and W62 aiming to seal Black off seems a little unreasonable.];B[oj]C[B63: Black doesn't give in, and is not afraid of a ko fight.]
;W[pl];B[pr];W[om];B[io]C[After B67, White's big dragon has no way to live, White's only hope is to win the capturing race.];W[hp];B[hq];W[ps];B[rq];W[rr];B[sr];W[qq];B[rp];W[pn]

;W[dr];B[fr];W[gk];B[gl]LB[hk:a][fk:b]C[B93: if Black plays at 'a', then W 'b'.];W[ej]C[W94 is a good move.];B[fk]C[B95: Black has many choices, the play in the game is simple and clear.];W[jm];B[kn];W[fj];B[hn]
;W[jp];B[kl]LB[dl:a]C[B101: Black perhaps should jump to 'a'.];W[hk]C[W102 is alert.];B[kk];W[kj];B[jl];W[ji]LB[im:a]C[W106: if White connects at 'a', it will lead to a complicated fight, White has no assurance of success.];B[ij];W[ik]
;B[im]C[After 109, Black has obtained a 70-point territory, how White turns his thickness to a big territory is an uneasy task.];W[nc];B[dl];W[qc]C[W112: White attacks first, it is a positive play.];B[pc];W[qd];B[qe];W[pb]LB[pe:a][qb:b]C[W116: White wants to attack the whole black group, if White cuts at 'a', then Black will hane at 'b', Black can make life easily.];B[ob];W[qb]
;B[oc];W[nd];B[nb];W[lc];B[mb];W[pe]LB[rd:a]C[W124: White aims to prevent Black from killing White's corner with the hane move at 'a'.];B[mc];W[ld];B[md];W[pf];B[le];W[lb]C[W130 is the strongest resistance.]
;B[jd];W[jb];B[ke];W[ic];B[oe];W[mf];B[of];W[qf];B[lg]C[B139 is a good move.];W[mg];B[me];W[he];B[dk]C[B143: Black tenukis to reinforce himself, meaning that the only way for White to win the game is to kill Black's big dragon.]
;W[id]C[W144 is the vital point for detroying eyes.];B[mh];W[ng];B[og];W[nh];B[ma];W[oa];B[kb];W[kc];B[jc];W[ka];B[lf];W[kh]
