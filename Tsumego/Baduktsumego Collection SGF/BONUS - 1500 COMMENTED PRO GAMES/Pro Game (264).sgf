In the game 5 that ended on 26th, Cho U taking White defeated Kato Masao and takes a 3-2 lead in the best-of-7 series, so he is just one victory away from the champion.];B[qd]C[In the first four games, the series were tied at 2:2, so this game 5 is the truly most important game.];W[dp]C[The referee for this game is Hane Yasumasa 9p, who once stopped the winning streak of Nie Weiping in China-Japan Super Go Contest.];B[cd];W[pp];B[oc]
;W[qi];B[ed];W[cj];B[qk]LB[jq:a]C[Kato Masao almost always elects to play two small points of B1 and B3 while taking Black. The invasion of B9 is his style, playing the split at 'a' is common.];W[qe];B[pd];W[qn];B[qg]LB[ok:a][oj:b]C[B13: From the globe point of view, for Black to jump at 'a' would be better. In the game, after being attacked by White's knight's move at 'b', Black is not smooth to get out.];W[oj]
;B[ol];W[rd];B[rc];W[mk];B[nm];W[ll]LB[pg:a][ln:b][np:c]TR[qg]C[W20: White can consider to press at 'a', this way Black may not want to sacrifice the marked stone, next White plays at 20, if B 'b', then White can jump at around 'c', there should be no other variation.];B[ln];W[pg];B[np]
;W[qf]C[In the game, after the exchange of B23 and W24, White also has nothing to complain.];B[fq];W[ip]C[After this move, it is time for noon break, Kato has consumed 56 minutes, Cho U has used 2 hours and 4 minutes.];B[fo];W[dn];B[in]TR[ip]LB[lp:a][pr:b]C[It looks fierce and ruthless for Black to attack the marked white stone with B27 and B29, but in fact after White's two-space extension at 'a', Black itself becomes thin. With B27, Black should first play at 'b' as an asking move, then decide how to play on the left side.];W[lp]
(;B[lq]LB[pr:a][pq:b][qr:c][nq:d][oq:e]TR[lp]C[B31: If Black now plays at 'a', then W 'b', B 'c' and W 'd', Black is no good. If the marked white stone is not there, Black can wedge at 'e' next (see var a).];W[kq];B[mq];W[oq]C[The diagonal's extension of W34 is an excellent point!];B[kr];W[kp];B[jr]
;W[kn];B[lm];W[km]C[Black has no severe tactic for attacking the three white stones, after the attachment of W40, Black has failed.];B[po];W[qo]LB[kl:a]C[The exchange of B41 and W42 makes White's corner completely worry-free, but this is the price Black has to pay in order to cut at 'a'. However after the cut, Black doesn't get his expected result, the situation is already to White's advantage.];B[kl];W[im];B[hn];W[hm];B[gn];W[kk]

Black has used 2 hours and 50 minutes and White has consumed 4 hours and 15 minutes.];B[ni];W[nj];B[li];W[oi];B[mj];W[hc];B[jc];W[jd];B[hd];W[ic];B[kc]
;W[id];B[fb];W[dr]C[The jump of W90 is the last big point.];B[fg];W[gk];B[fk];W[le];B[mc];W[gd]LB[fh:a]C[After the hane of W96, then White plays at 'a', it is a good sequence play! After making one eye by killing three black stones, White is clearly leading in territory.];B[ge];W[fh]

;B[pl];W[oo];B[mp];W[on];B[nn];W[bg]C[W130: White has grabbed the biggest point on the whole board. Black's final bet is to kill White's big group on the right side, but this is almost impossible.];B[rg];W[of]TR[qg][rg]C[The tiger of W132 is a calm move, if Black tries to kill the two marked white stones, the variation would be complicated.];B[ri];W[qh];B[rh]
;W[ng];B[ke];W[kd];B[ld];W[mg];B[lg];W[me];B[nh];W[qj];B[rj]LB[ka:a]C[B145 is the last losing move! Black should stand at 'a' to initiate the ko immediately, although there is still no obvious winning chance, because White has so many local ko threats, but due to the addition of the atari at 'a', White has to eliminate the ko with two moves, Black would have more chances.];W[nd];B[oh]
