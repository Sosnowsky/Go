Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[In the final game of the second phase, Chinese third player Rui Naiwei defeated Chinen Kaori easily and snapped the latter's three-game winning streak, showing a very strong strength.];W[pp];B[dc];W[de];B[dp]
;W[fd];B[qn]LB[fc:a]C[The approach of B7 is to prepare to attach at 'a' and serve as ladder breaker.];W[nq];B[fc];W[gd];B[ce];W[dd];B[cd];W[cc]C[Rui Naiwei seems to like the play of W12 and W14.];B[cf];W[ec]
;B[db];W[eb];B[cb]C[Through B19, White obtains thickness and Black takes territory.];W[oc];B[pe];W[qk];B[nd];W[mc];B[qi];W[qo];B[pn];W[ok];B[mn]
;W[mp];B[pl];W[pk];B[oi]LB[ml:a]C[The jump of B33 is a questionable move, to jump at 'a' is just the vital point, here is the direction to play.];W[ml];B[mm]LB[nn:a][ll:b]C[B35 is to guard against White's crosscut at 'a', Black has to exchange B35 with W 'b' and is very painful!];W[ll];B[kn];W[jp]
;B[jm];W[ni]C[The attachment of W40 is still a good point, therefore we can see the jump of B33 is not big.];B[nh];W[mi];B[jk];W[mh];B[hq];W[cn];B[cp];W[ck]C[White makes extension with W48 and completely breaks up the situation.];B[lq]C[But B49 to grab territory appears too hasty, Black's profit is limited, however Black in the center becomes thin.];W[lp]
;B[kq];W[kp];B[jq];W[ip];B[dl];W[en];B[cl]LB[gq:a]C[B55 and B57 is too unreasonable! Black may feel her opening is not good and thus elects to play this way. However with the play in the real game Black will lose even faster!. The original move of B55 and B57 is to double at 'a'.];W[fq];B[fp];W[gp]C[Following W60, White elects to give up territory and strengthen the center, it is a very simple and severe play.];B[gq]
;W[ep];B[fo];W[eo];B[eq];W[fr];B[er];W[gn];B[fs];W[hk];B[in];W[ej];B[ek]LB[fk:a]C[B73 is the last losing move, at any rate Black should make the knight's move at 'a', this way Black probably can separate White then try to connect Black itself together.]

;W[id];B[ed];W[ee];B[fe];W[hf];B[gf];W[gc];B[lf];W[lg]C[In the real game, Black tries to make life in a hurry, White becomes much thicker! The eye shape of Black's big dragon is already not enough. The most critical is, even if Black's big dragon doesn't die, Black's territory is still not adequate! Finally Black's big dragon fails to live and is being killed miserably.])
