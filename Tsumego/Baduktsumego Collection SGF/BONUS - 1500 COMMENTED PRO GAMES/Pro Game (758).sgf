;B[nd];W[rd]C[Through W18, both sides are roughly acceptable.];B[fd];W[nf];B[lf];W[gf]LB[dh:a]C[W22: The selection point for shallow reduction is interesting, the common move is to play shoulder-hit at 'a'.];B[gh]C[B23: Black elects to attack from outside, here starts a fierce fight.];W[ef];B[eh];W[if];B[he]
;W[hf];B[fe];W[ff];B[ih];W[ge];B[hc];W[ce];B[cd];W[cg];B[be]LB[oq:a]C[B37: Black directly initiates the ko, its timing is too early and questionable. Black can consider to approach the corner at 'a' and wait for the right moment to start the ko.];W[bf];B[de]

;B[np]C[The shoulder-hit of B75 is a good point, White's moyo doesn't yield a good profit, it is a little pity.];W[op];B[no];W[mr];B[mf];W[ld];B[ne];W[ie];B[kp];W[dk];B[dj];W[ej]C[W84 and W86 are good moves, Kong Jie is very careful and precise in settling local patterns.]
;B[ck]LB[fj:a][bp:b]C[B87: If Black plays atari at 'a', then B 'b' taking one stone becomes sente. Black has no choice but to retreat with B87, White continues to be favorable after taking some profit here.];W[pm];B[qk];W[qh];B[kc];W[kd];B[qi]C[The attachment of B93 is a common play to dodge, but in this game Black is not favorable in ko threats and can't utilize his tactics.];W[pi];B[ph];W[oh]C[After White plays atari of W96, Black has no good answer.]
;B[qm]C[Following B97, Black can only turn the body around and continue to dodge.];W[pl];B[pn];W[ql];B[qo];W[rp];B[rl];W[on];B[oo];W[rm];B[nn];W[qn];B[om]
