Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[pd]C[This is the 8th time Yu Bin and Cho U meet each other, it is really a pity, Yu Bin lost again.];W[dq];B[pq];W[dd];B[do]
;W[po]C[B5 and W6: Black and White approach each other's corner, this kind of situation appears many times in their games, both sides all have their own special style, the play is very interesting.];B[qo];W[qn];B[qp];W[dm]C[Afterwards, Black attaches with B7 and White pincers with W10, these are their different answers as to high approach, Yu Bin always attaches the corner, Cho U always pincers.];B[fo];W[gq];B[ck];W[el];B[cf];W[dj];B[ef]C[B17 is not good, its purpose is not clear.]
;W[fc];B[cj]LB[dk:a]C[Perhaps originally with B19 Black prepares to push and cut at 'a', but since it is fast game, Black can't see clearly, now Black elects to crawl at 19, this way White already takes advantage.];W[di];B[ci];W[qf]LB[pn:a]C[W22: White is unnecessary to play this complicatedly, White can simply connect at 'a' then make extension, White can be happy.];B[qh]C[Black pincers with B23.];W[of];B[nd];W[rd]C[White's play from W24 to W26 is a little far-fetched.]

;W[nf];B[lh];W[kf];B[jh]C[Black keeps to attack White with the sequence from B29 to B43.];W[jd]LB[je:a]C[The knight's move of W44 is relatively unreasonable. If Yu Bin 9p now crosscuts at 'a', this fight will to Black's advantage.];B[if]C[But in this game Black's play is a little conservative, with B45 Black originally wants to squeeze White's shape, but Cho U plays very well.];W[ig];B[jg];W[jf];B[ie];W[kd]
;B[gd];W[fd];B[lc];W[hc];B[hh]C[From W46 to B55, White connects back in sente, breaking away from Black's attack, White is relatively easier to take control of the situation.];W[hl];B[cq];W[cr];B[dp];W[eq];B[br];W[dh];B[dk]
;W[ek];B[ch];W[bq];B[cp];W[bs];B[cm];W[be];B[ho];W[ar]C[W72: White takes in the corner, it is somewhat weird, let's see whether Yu Bin can grab this chance.];B[fj]C[B73 appears very severe, but Black overlooks White's counterattack tactic.];W[dg];B[bf]
;W[gi]C[When White caps with W76, Black unexpectedly retreats!];B[ce];W[gh];B[gg];W[gn];B[fp];W[hr];B[bo];W[ij];B[mr];W[cd]C[Through W86, B73 dies unconditionally, although Black doesn't incur any loss in points, but Black loses the final target to attack, Black is basically very hard to redeem his loss. Later on White's endgame is somewhat questionable, but it already has nothing to do with the outcome of this game.];B[jb]
