Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[In the first round of 12th LG Cup, Hu Yaoyu 8p met Lee Changho 9p again. Within three days, they played each other twice in Fujitsu Cup and LG Cup, it was really an coincidence.];W[dc];B[pq];W[dq];B[co]
;W[dk];B[ep];W[eq];B[fp];W[fq];B[gp];W[hq];B[ci];W[ce];B[ck];W[cp];B[bp]LB[bo:a]C[As to the diagonal of W16, with B17 Black can only descend at 'a'.]
;W[cl];B[dl];W[dm];B[el];W[do];B[dp];W[cq]C[From W18 to W24, the game enters into White's tempo.];B[cn];W[cm];B[dn];W[em];B[ek];W[dj]
;B[cj];W[en];B[eo];W[di]LB[gn:a]C[W34 is over-zealous! If White jumps to 'a', Black is already very difficult to handle. Since Black makes one false eye after taking W22, Black's big dragon is not alive and Black is very painful.];B[dh];W[fj];B[gk];W[eh];B[fn]C[After White pulls out, Black plays the strong move of B39.];W[fm]LB[ch:a]C[Following W40, White has no assurance of success. White should directly play atari at 'a' and take one stone.]
;B[gm];W[ch];B[bk];W[fl];B[fk];W[gl];B[hl];W[hm];B[bm];W[gn];B[bl];W[fo];B[dg]C[Black extends out, the fight is chaotic.]
;W[cg]LB[go:a]C[W54: White clearly didn't notice, after B 'a', White already can't connect, however when W54, White already has no other good and simple tactic.];B[df];W[cf];B[hk];W[fh];B[im];W[in];B[go];W[jm];B[fn];W[ff]C[White has no other choices but to play W62 and W64.]
;B[gm]C[After Black takes with B65, Black's situation is favorable, but the game is still early.];W[oc];B[jc]LB[ic:a]C[B67: Black wants to split at 'a'.];W[hc];B[mc]C[The play in the game is Lee's steady style.];W[qo];B[qk];W[op];B[oq];W[np];B[nq]
;W[mp];B[mq];W[lp]C[As to the pincer of B71, from W72 to W78 White ends in gote and really is inexplicable. Especially White still continues to extend with W78, rather than taking tenuki and attacking on the right side!

After this move, it is time for noon break.];B[ph]C[After Black reinforces with B79, if the game proceeds normally, White's territory is not enough.];W[pg]C[Therefore White has to attach in with W80.];B[og];W[pe]C[The hane of B81 is to entice the jump of W82, then Black plays push-and-cut, but this is not Lee Changho's original intension and style. With B81 for Black to take the vital point at 82 is better.];B[pd];W[od];B[oe];W[of]

;W[pm];B[rn];W[ro];B[qm];W[qn];B[rm];W[kj]C[After a fierce fight, White's corner is being killed, but through W132 White encloses a territory of 30 points by sacrificing, White is hopeful to turn the game around.];B[bq];W[br];B[lg]LB[ge:a]C[B135: Lee Changho judges he is still a little favorable so elects to play steadily. If Black pierces through at 'a', it will lead to another intense fight.];W[he]
;B[ib];W[hb];B[li];W[lj];B[ni];W[mj];B[mf]LB[pk:a]C[B143 is sente, White needs to guard against B 'a'.];W[mi];B[id];W[si];B[sh];W[hd]
;B[rq]LB[ar:a][qr:b][jr:c]C[B149: Black should play hane at 'a', although it is not sente, W 'b' and B 'c' are miai, Black must get one.];W[bo]C[White cuts with W150, Black incurs loss.];B[jk];W[kl];B[kk];W[lk];B[hn];W[mh]LB[sf:a][kf:b]C[W156 is slow. White should reduce liberty at 'a', this way White may not need to play W156 and can directly play at 'b'.]
;B[bn]LB[ha:a][jf:b]C[B157: For Black to play hane at 'a' then make knight at 'b' is better.];W[aq];B[ao];W[kf];B[ko]LB[jr:a]C[B161: For Black to simply make knight at 'a' is better.];W[kn];B[jr];W[jq];B[pk]
