Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[Gu Li 9p plays very well in this game and helped Chinese Team to win the champion by beating Lee Sedol 9p.];W[dc];B[pp];W[dp];B[ce]
;W[ci];B[cn];W[cl]C[They played this opening through W8 in LG Cup game, Gu Li won that game, now Lee Sedol elects to play it again, he must have studied this opening.];B[gc];W[ed];B[jd];W[cd]LB[df:a]C[Sure enough, W12 is the variation. Before, White always makes the knight's move at 'a', Black gets to live the corner easily, White is not satisfied, now W12 is just the newest update to this shape.];B[pj];W[oc];B[mc];W[oh]C[W16 is light and nimble.]
;B[od]LB[pe:a][qh:b][qj:c]C[By Gu Li's style, the counterattack of B17 is inevitable. In fact, Black can consider to play at 'a', next W 'b' and B 'c', this way Black can try to protect both sides.];W[qh];B[pc];W[rj]C[W20: White gets to settle and can be satisfied.];B[dh];W[di];B[fh]C[B23: For Black to make extension is also fine, Black wants to stick the head fast by jumping.];W[fi]C[But White gets to tangle with W24.]
;B[gi];W[ei];B[fe];W[gh];B[ee];W[hh]C[Through W30, in the exchange, White's shape is good and Black is being snubbed.];B[cq];W[cp];B[dq];W[ep];B[bp];W[bo];B[bq]
;W[co];B[fq];W[go]LB[fp:a]C[W40 is to guard against B 'a', normally this kind of vital point can't be missed.];B[qk];W[nd];B[nc];W[oe];B[ob];W[gq];B[fr];W[nj]LB[qn:a]C[W48 is too soft, for White to invade at 'a' is very powerful.]
;B[qn];W[ie]C[The play of W50 is unique, and it is hard to imagine.];B[fd]LB[id:a]C[If B51 at 'a', White will push and cut at 51.];W[be];B[kf];W[jg];B[kg];W[id]C[W56: Although White destroys some territory, but comparing with B55, Black sticks the head out, W56 is not big.];B[jf];W[if];B[ec]
;W[je];B[dd];W[cc];B[ke];W[kd];B[jc]LB[ld:a]C[B65 is strong, in fact for Black to sacrifice at 'a' is also not bad.];W[kh]C[W66 is a strong move! Forcing Black to make a choice and creating some chaotic.];B[lh];W[jh];B[li]LB[lg:a]C[Normally B67 and B69 are correct moves. But in this situation, W 'a' is a strong move! Black will be separated. With B67, Black can play atari at 68 first, then play B67 and B69, this way White couldn't cut strongly.]
;W[lg];B[mg];W[lf];B[le];W[mf];B[me];W[nf];B[oi]LB[lk:a]C[B77: Black should play at 'a'.];W[ni];B[nh]C[B77 and B79 are impulsive moves!];W[lj]C[Gu Li overlooks that White's strong move of W80 is working!]
;B[og];W[ph];B[ki]LB[ng:a][of:b][pg:c][qf:d]C[B83: Black has no other choices, if Black connects at 'a', next W 'b', B 'c' and W 'd', Black is no good.];W[kj];B[ji];W[ng];B[ii];W[hi];B[mh]
;W[pf]C[After W90, Black sinks into a bitter battle.];B[ik];W[jk];B[jl];W[ij]C[W92 and W94 are severe!];B[jj];W[kk];B[kl];W[il];B[hj];W[mk];B[im]
;W[hl];B[gn]C[B101 and B103: Black is forced to turn the body around.];W[hm];B[ho];W[hn];B[fo];W[gp];B[fp];W[fn];B[en];W[fm]C[After W112, White is clearly favorable.];B[bn]
;W[dn]C[But afterwards, Lee Sedol's play starts to lose common senses!];B[eo];W[nq]LB[dm:a][mm:b]C[W116: White should first retreat at 'a', then jump to 'b', this way White would be simply favorable.];B[nl]C[B117 is a good move! Black is on the way to turn the game around by using White's tight-liberty defect.];W[ml];B[mm];W[nm];B[np];W[om];B[oq]
;W[qm]C[W124: White tries all he can to reinforce the defect, but after capturing three stones, White's tight-liberty defect still exists.];B[rm];W[ql];B[rl];W[pn];B[qo];W[rk];B[dm]C[B131 is big! The situation becomes unclear.];W[fg];B[ic];W[mo];B[mp]
;W[lp]LB[lo:a]C[W136 is the losing move! White should retreat at 'a', this way the outcome of the game is still difficult to imagine.];B[lo]C[Black cuts with B137.];W[no];B[kp];W[lq];B[ln];W[kq];B[ol]C[B143: With just one careless move, all White's prior effort is wasted.];W[pk];B[ll];W[mj]
