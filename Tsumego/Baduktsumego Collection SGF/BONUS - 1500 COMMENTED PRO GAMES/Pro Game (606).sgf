;B[jp];W[qn];B[qp];W[qk]C[So far, the openings from both sides are impressive and dignified.];B[qi];W[on];B[pm];W[pn];B[mp];W[ok];B[qf]LB[jc:a]C[B17: Black can also consider to make an extension on the side at 'a', this way Black's tempo is a little faster.

;W[jc]LB[fc:a][di:b]C[W18: White also thought to protect the corner at 'a', Black perhaps will extend at 18, then W 'b', this way it will easily lead to a territory race.];B[cf];W[be]LB[fd:a][bd:b][cc:c][ci:d]C[W20: If White jumps to 'a', then B 'b', W 'c' and B 'd', Black would be too happy. White can't accept this variation.];B[di];W[dg];B[id]LB[bf:a][df:b]C[The knight's move of B21 is originally not a bad move, but when W22, Black takes tenuki, it seems not well-coordinated. Either with B21 Black blocks at 'a' or extends one line more, or with B23 Black should attach out at 'b' to fight directly with White.]
;W[ic];B[gd];W[cg]C[After White blocks down with W26, White clearly takes some advantage.];B[hc];W[jd];B[ie];W[je];B[if];W[nc]C[Although Black's sequence following B27 is a good shape, but the extension of W32 is a also not bad.];B[dc];W[ec]LB[cc:a]C[White hanes outside with W34, it is unreasonable, White should hane inside at 'a', this would be simple and clear.]
;B[ed];W[cc];B[db];W[fc]LB[ee:a][fd:b][cd:c]C[W38: White still should atari at 'a' instead, then B 'b' and W 'c'.];B[fd]LB[df:a][ef:b][cd:c][cb:d]C[B39: In the game Black has missed a good chance! Black should simply jump to 'a', White is very hard to deal with it (if White hanes at 'b' as in the game, Black can live the corner with the atari at 'c'). Due to the exchange of B39 and 'd', when Black hanes at 'a', White can hane at 'b', Black doesn't have any good tactic.];W[cb]
;B[ob];W[nb];B[oc];W[nd];B[dq];W[cq];B[cr];W[cp];B[er];W[dk];B[dm]C[The shoulder-hit of B51 is a good move, White has no intention to resist.];W[cm];B[dl]
;W[ck];B[df];W[ef];B[de];W[cd];B[eg];W[eh];B[fg];W[fh];B[fo]C[With the jump of B63, Black breaks away from the main battle field, in fact because Black doesn't know how to play well, so Black takes tenuki, this is not rarely seen in fast games.];W[qg]LB[dh:a][gg:b][ff:c][gf:d][ee:e][hh:f]C[But the timing of the attachment of B64 is clearly not right. Now for Black to cut at 'a' is already very urgent and dangerous, White should directly play the sequence of W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 'e' and W 'f', this way White is obviously favorable.]

(;B[re]LB[pg:a][dh:b][qe:c][pf:d][pe:e][oe:f][od:g][qc:h]C[B65 and B67 are weak, these two are also the losing moves for the game, now to obtain sente is the most important! First with B65 Black should hane at 'a', allowing White to crossover, Black can obtain sente to cut at 89 in sente; Next with B67, at any rate Black should atari at 'a', followed by W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f', W67, B 'g' and W 'h', White can live in the corner, but Black gets to cut at 'b'. Because of the jump of B63, Black's cut at 'b' is very powerful (see var a).];W[pf];B[sf];W[qe];B[rf];W[gg]
;B[ff];W[gf];B[ee];W[hh]C[In the game, White takes advantage in sente then comes back to play W72 to W76, White's victory already can't be altered.];B[gb];W[eb];B[bf];W[bg];B[ag];W[ah];B[af];W[bi];B[jf]
