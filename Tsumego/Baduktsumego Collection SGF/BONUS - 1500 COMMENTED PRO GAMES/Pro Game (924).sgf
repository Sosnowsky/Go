;W[cf];B[db];W[od];B[cc]C[The opening from B1 to B9 is Luo Xihe's favorite.];W[qc];B[cn];W[fq];B[ch];W[po]C[As to the approach of B11, with W12 and W14, White may want to pincer.];B[fe]C[B15: Black jumps up and attack White first and has nothing to complain.];W[ef];B[dj]

;B[md]C[B31 is a talented move!];W[mc];B[nd];W[oc]LB[nc:a][pd:b]C[W34: If White block at 'a', then Black will bump at 'b', White is painful.];B[rc];W[qb]LB[qe:a]C[W36: White wants badly to clamp at 'a', but Black will play atari at 36, White is difficult, on the left side, Black has many ko threats.];B[oe];W[pe];B[nc]
;W[nb];B[ob];W[oa];B[pd];W[pc];B[qe];W[pf];B[qf];W[ne];B[mb];W[pb];B[pg];W[of]C[From B37 to W52, Black handles lightly.]
;B[qm]C[B53: Black gets to attack first, Black is leading for the whole game, therefore with W48 for White to extend at 51 is better.];W[qq];B[qr];W[qp];B[or];W[on];B[mp]C[B59: Black threatens to attack White.];W[pi]LB[pl:a][qk:b]C[So with W60 White can consider to make the knight's move at 'a', if Black jumps out at 'b', then W60.];B[om]LB[nn:a]C[After B61, Black's cut at 'a' is very severe! White needs to strengthen the cut.]
;W[nm];B[ol];W[np]C[W64 is a good move to strengthen the cut.];B[og]C[B65: Black is forced to make an exchange.];W[nq];B[nl];W[mm];B[ml];W[lm];B[nf];W[oe];B[kk]
;W[ng]LB[ql:a]C[In the process, with W74 White can consider to seek life by attaching at 'a', this will be game-deciding.];B[nh];W[mf];B[mh];W[nr];B[rn]C[Through B79, the situation is about even.];W[hn]LB[ci:a]C[W80 enclosing territory is questionable, to capture one stone at 'a' is very big.];B[jn];W[jm]
;B[im];W[in];B[km];W[kn];B[jl];W[jo];B[en];W[co];B[bn];W[jm];B[go];W[fo];B[dg]C[Black takes one stone in sente and becomes very thick, this also helps Black in the fight later on.]

;B[ac];W[eb]C[From B95 to W110, Black takes advantage in sente by using thickness.];B[fn]C[Following B111, Black judges that he is favorable for the game, in fact the situation is not clear.];W[kl];B[fp];W[gp];B[eo];W[gq];B[rq];W[rp];B[sq];W[jk]
;B[il];W[lk];B[kj];W[nj]LB[ll:a][hm:b]C[In the fight following W124, both sides have no assurance of success. With W124 for White to play at 'a' is common, next B124 and W 'b', this way the outcome of the game is still difficult to imagine.];B[ll];W[oh];B[qg];W[li];B[lh];W[ki];B[km]

;B[oo];W[pn];B[km];W[sp];B[mn];W[rr];B[qj]C[In the real game, it forms a big ko fight, but Yu Bin clearly is pressed by time, after B151, White already sinks into a difficult situation.];W[qi];B[rj];W[ri];B[pk];W[ok];B[ql]

;W[mp];B[jp];W[ip];B[jr]C[Several exchanges were conducted later on, but it already has nothing to do with the outcome of the game. Luo Xihe's recent state is especially good, hope he can beat Lee Changho in the Samsung Cup final.])
