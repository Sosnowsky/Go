;W[er];B[fn];W[gn];B[en];W[cq];B[gm]LB[go:a][gp:b][ho:c][el:d][jq:e]C[B19 can also cut at 'a', followed by W 'b', B 'c', W 19, B 'd' and W 'e'.];W[hn];B[hm]
;W[in];B[im];W[jn];B[jm];W[kn]LB[pq:a][qo:b]C[The situation through 26 appeared once in the 1st round game between Chang Hao 9p and Choi Wongyong 1p, the difference is that the position of knight's move on the lower right is at 'a' and 'b'.];B[cf]LB[ll:a]C[B27 starts to vary, Choi 1p played at 'a', from the game result, Black is not successful, obviously Cho had some study on this.];W[fc]LB[fd:a]C[W28 can also play at 'a'.]
;B[gd];W[gc];B[id];W[di];B[ef];W[fi];B[cc]C[B35 is a tough move, it put White into an unstable situation.];W[cd];B[bd];W[be];B[bc];W[ce];B[dc]
;W[fd];B[bf];W[hd];B[ic]C[After B45, White's shape seems narrow and constrained.];W[ff];B[fg];W[dg];B[df];W[eg];B[gh]C[B51 seems awkward, but it's very practical.];W[gi];B[hh]LB[fe:a][gf:b][ge:c][ee:d][he:e][hf:f][ie:g][af:h]C[If B53 atari at 'a', White can play at 'b', then B 'c', W 'd', B 'e', W 'f', B 'g' and W 'h', Black is not good.]

;B[ik];W[hj];B[kj]TR[jk]C[Through 89, White still have some aji left to move out W86 (the marked white stone) to cut Black in half.];W[qo];B[pp];W[kf];B[lf];W[lg];B[kh];W[jd]C[The sequence through W96 is good.];B[kd]

What we should note is, in the lower left Black can block at 'a', W 'b' take and Black can hane and cross over with 'c'.]
