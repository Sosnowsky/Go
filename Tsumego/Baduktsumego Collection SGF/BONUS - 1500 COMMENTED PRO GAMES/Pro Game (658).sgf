];W[dd];B[qp];W[dp];B[nq]C[B5 was once very popular, but now it is rarely seen.]

;B[ng];W[pl];B[qm];W[mk];B[pm]C[After Black retreats with B21, Black still wants to play B23, therefore with B21 for Black to play B23 directly is better.];W[nf]C[After the push of W24, Black has a problem to connect, White is easier to play.];B[lg];W[kk];B[ol];W[nl];B[nj];W[ok]
;B[om];W[nk];B[lj];W[kj];B[rf]C[B33 and B35: Black aims to guard against White's peep and attack.];W[oi]C[As to this, White's counterattack of W36 is intense!];B[qe]LB[oh:a][pg:b]C[B37: If Black blocks at 'a', next W 'b', Black is not good, so Black has no choice but to play the sequence following B37.];W[pc];B[od];W[oh]
;B[pf];W[og]C[W42: White connects thickly, Black gains nothing, White is good.];B[ob];W[re];B[qg];W[rb];B[cj];W[qq]C[W48 is a move worth learning! At first glance, Black's corner is very thick, but W48 hits Black's weak point.];B[pq]C[B49: Although Black is painful, but in order not to allow White live the corner, Black can only tolerate, White again takes advantage. In most cases, this kind of moves like W48 are all good moves.];W[pr];B[rq];W[kd]LB[ke:a]C[Since several stones including B25 are very light, with W52 if White plays at 'a' , it is even more difficult for Black to handle, in the real game, Black certainly can't escape, but sacrifice also sets Black free.]

;W[oq];B[qr]C[After this move, it is time for lunch break.];W[np];B[mq];W[pp];B[qq];W[mn];B[mo];W[mp];B[lp];W[no];B[lo];W[nm]C[White reduces Black's territory in sente from W66 to W78, this is the advantage left by W48.]
;B[or];W[gf]LB[md:a]C[W80: White aims to put pressure on Black, in fact for White to capture Black at 'a' in the center is already very good.];B[me]C[B81: Of course Black  will escape, this way Black is leading in territory.];W[mf];B[lf];W[jg];B[le];W[ld];B[lc];W[md];B[ne]
;W[co];B[pb];W[qb];B[sc];W[sb];B[ch]LB[db:a]C[B95: For Black to play at 'a' is more valuable.];W[fc]LB[ec:a]C[W96: White should play at 'a' to protect the corner, this way White is a little favorable.];B[cd]C[Black's sequence following B97 to live the corner is very beautiful.];W[ce]
;B[dc];W[ec];B[de];W[ed];B[cq];W[dq];B[cc];W[dg];B[bb]C[Through B107, Black simply makes life, the situation is not clear.];W[di];B[dj];W[ci];B[bi]
;W[dh];B[bn];W[bo];B[fe];W[ee];B[em]LB[fj:a]C[Not sure it is false impression or miscalculation, now the tactic at the top is already very obvious, however Lee Changho overlooks it. With B117 Black certainly should jump to a'', this will help both the center and the top.];W[hc];B[ic]LB[nd:a]C[When W118, the original move of B119 is to strengthen at 'a' only, this way the game is still early.];W[ej];B[ek]
;W[fk];B[fj];W[ei];B[el];W[gk]LB[hq:a]C[White appears experienced with the sequence from W120 to W126! Making the outside thick is the last preparation, now if Black still doesn't strengthen, White will have assurance of success. According to B119's psychology, the value at 'a' is definitely not smaller than B119, Black most likely will play at 'a'.];B[hq];W[bd];B[bc];W[nd]C[W130 completes the last strike! It is very strange, the ko tactic at the top is not difficult at all, Lee Changho really didn't see it? If so, Black will strengthen at 130 with B127, this way the outcome of the game still subjects to the endgame.];B[oe];W[oc]

The date for the final game 4 is still not decided.])
