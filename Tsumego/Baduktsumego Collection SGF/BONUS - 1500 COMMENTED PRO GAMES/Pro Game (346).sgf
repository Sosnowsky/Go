Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[Recently Yoda's opening is very interesting, while taking Black, he always first defends one worry-free corner, then starts his opening in no hurry. This is quite different from the current advanced theory of seeking speed and efficiency, however his winning ratio is still very high, we can only say this is due to his very strong power!];W[dd];B[cp];W[pp];B[eq]
;W[oc];B[ld];W[jc];B[nd]C[W8: White strikes first, the jump of B9 was used by Japanese players before. In the game, Song TaeKon incurred loss in the fight here, showing he perhaps rarely study Japanese games in his spare time.];W[od];B[oe];W[nc];B[pe]
(;W[lc]LB[md:a][me:b][ne:c][nf:d]C[W14 is the losing cause, here White can only atari at 'a', then B 'b', W 'c', B 'd' and W14 (see var a).];B[kc]C[The wedge of B15 is intense! Song TaeKon must have overlooked this move.];W[md];B[lb];W[mc];B[kd];W[jb];B[kb]C[Through B21, White was pierced through by Black, White sinks into passivity.]
;W[mf];B[kf]LB[gd:a]C[B23 is Yoda's first-rate original move, to cap at 'a' is more positive.];W[fc];B[kh];W[mh];B[qi];W[cj];B[id]C[B28 makes White painful, there is no good answer, Song TaeKon simply takes tenuki.];W[cm]LB[hc:a]C[W30: White can only tolerate by playing at 'a', in the game Black captures two stones by playing at 'a', although it is only 10+ points, but it is related to the thickness and thinness of both sides, it looks small but big in reality.]
;B[ng];W[mg];B[hc];W[qn];B[pr]LB[jq:a]C[B35 is over territory-oriented! For Black to make an extension at 'a' should be satisfied.];W[qq]LB[nq:a]C[Unexpectedly, White answers with W36! White should play at 'a' to take influence.];B[mq];W[qk];B[pk];W[pl]
;B[ne];W[me];B[pj];W[ol];B[rk];W[kq];B[qr];W[ql];B[bd]LB[pq:a][nr:b]C[B49 is not careful and precise enough, Black should squeeze at 'a' to prevent White from striking at 'b', this way Black's opening is simple and clear, the game is to Black's advantage.];W[cc]TR[pr]LB[cd:a]C[Seeing Black takes advantage with the marked black stone, Yoda again plays B49, but White makes mistake again! Because Black is very thick in the surroundings, White has not preconditions to attack Black, with W50, White should defend at 'a'.]

;W[fh];B[fg];W[eg];B[dh];W[di];B[eh];W[ei];B[ab];W[da];B[be]C[In the game, up to B73, Black easily makes life, White gains nothing.];W[nr]LB[pq:a]C[Due to the problem of B49, the strike of W74 is severe! To squeeze at 'a' is too late.]

;W[gq]C[Through W88, White gains a big profit, White's situation takes a better turn.];B[gh];W[fi];B[gf];W[ge];B[he];W[gb];B[hb];W[gd];B[lp]C[With the diagonal of B97, Yoda probably has already prepared for a prolonged war.];W[kp]LB[no:a]C[But next, only one move W98 leads Song TaeKon into a losing situation! With W98, White should extend at 'a', White would have a chance only if keep attacking Black.]
;B[no]C[The hane of B99 almost makes White faint! In the game, White has been wrapped up to a big pie, Black gains a strong leg on the first line!];W[oo]LB[mp:a][lo:b]C[In the process, With W100, if White squeezes at 'a', then Black will extend at 'b', White is no good either, Song TaeKon perhaps ignores this move.];B[mp];W[nn];B[mo];W[oq];B[ms];W[op];B[ko];W[km]
;B[iq]C[B109: In an favorable situation, Black is not soft-hearted.];W[jo];B[kr];W[kn];B[jq];W[mn];B[lo];W[jp];B[io]C[Next the clamp o fB117 is again a good move, White can't move. Here it doesn't seem White attacks. Now White's situation is already very bad, even though Song TaeKon plays very tenaciously later on.];W[dq];B[dp];W[cq]

;B[ik];W[hi]C[White starts a ko, but because Yoda's advantage is huge earlier on, he can win the game even making a small retreat in the ko fight.];B[hl];W[ij];B[jj];W[hk];B[mj];W[qb];B[rb];W[og];B[pg];W[qc];B[rc]
