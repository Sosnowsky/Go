Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd];W[dd]C[Gu Li usually calls himself "Gu endgame", meaning endgame is the strongest part of his game. Few people believe this, but in this almost-no-fight game , "Gu endgame" is indeed brilliant.];B[pq];W[dp];B[fc]
;W[cf];B[kc];W[po];B[pm]C[B9 is a move Lee Sedol used against Zhou Heyang in recent city league tournament. Now Zhou Heyang tries to use it against Gu Li, very interesting.];W[mp]LB[no:a]C[W10 is variation, normally White will jump to 'a'.];B[pp];W[oo]C[Regarding the play of W12, most people think White is not good.];B[qo];W[qn];B[pn];W[rn]
;B[qp]LB[no:a]C[B17 is important, after this move, for Black to bump at 'a' is working.];W[ql];B[pl];W[qk];B[pk]LB[no:a]C[B21 is unnecessary, to bump directly at 'a' is just fine.];W[qi];B[no];W[iq];B[qg];W[pj]
;B[rj]C[B27 is good tesuji!];W[ri];B[oj]C[As a result, Black gets to hane very happily at head with B29.];W[pi];B[cn];W[fq];B[bp]LB[cm:a][ck:b]C[After B33, W 'a' is a must, so with B33 for Black to play at 'b' is more steady.];W[cm]LB[cq:a]C[W34: White definitely can't consider to answer at 'a'.]
;B[bm];W[bn];B[cl];W[dm];B[bo];W[jd];B[kd];W[bl];B[an];W[ck];B[fe];W[dl];B[db]C[Through B47, the situation is about even.]
;W[pf];B[pg];W[nf];B[of];W[jf];B[ke];W[qc];B[pc];W[pb];B[qb];W[rc];B[rb];W[nh]C[White's sequence from W48 to W60 is really eye-dazzling. However Black responds correctly, White didn't gain any advantage.]
;B[mo]LB[np:a]C[B61 prevents White from escaping two stone, comparing with B 'a', one is take territory and another is take influence, both have its pros and cons.];W[lq];B[kp];W[kq];B[np];W[oe];B[og];W[pd]C[White's sequence following W68 looks really crude.];B[oc];W[qe];B[rd]
;W[re];B[sc];W[ne];B[ng];W[mg];B[mf];W[me];B[mh];W[lf];B[lg];W[kf];B[mf];W[rg]
;B[mg];W[le]C[Through W86, White didn't gain much.];B[jp];W[ip];B[io]LB[jh:a]C[B89 is very big, but B 'a' is more urgent, since 'a' is mutual reduction and expansion point, and Black can also attack White, one stone for three birds!];W[cq];B[bq];W[hd];B[ic];W[eg]C[W92 and W94 are good moves!];B[jh]C[B95 is already one-step late.]
;W[gf]C[W96: White strengthens in sente, W96's value is huge.];B[cc];W[jj]C[W98 is good move! Here is just Black's vital point. Since the center is one-side open, Black is very difficult to enclose territory, White takes advantage.];B[oi]LB[ih:a][ii:b]C[B99 is thick play, but after White attaches at 'a', Black is not happy. So Black can consider to play at 'b'.];W[ih];B[jl];W[kh];B[hk];W[hc];B[mc]
;W[ik]LB[kk:a]C[W106: White can also consider to play at 'a' and destroy each other's territory.];B[il];W[hl];B[kj];W[hj];B[jk];W[ij]C[In the game, Black's territory in the center is still very big.];B[ki];W[cd]C[However, White grabs the biggest endgame with W114, the situation is still very close.];B[ji];W[bc]
;B[bb];W[dc];B[cb];W[gk];B[ho]C[In the following endgame fight, each player taught us one "striking" beautiful tesuji.];W[jq];B[ii];W[hh];B[rf];W[rh];B[ro];W[qf];B[br]
;W[bd];B[gb];W[hb];B[ec];W[or];B[pr];W[oq];B[nq];W[nr];B[op];W[mq];B[lp];W[ka]
;B[gp];W[gq];B[sl]LB[sn:a]C[First, the strike of B145, later on it leaves W 'a' big endgame worth 7+1/3 points. If Black first play at 'a', White will play at 145.];W[rm];B[sn];W[rl]LB[sm:a]C[B145 leaves the endgame B 'a' worth 7+1/3 points.];B[hm];W[gm];B[gn];W[ea]C[Next, the strike of W152, White takes 3-point advantage comparing with other plays.]
;B[ga];W[ab]C[In the end, Black leads 4 points on the board, White wins the game just right here.];B[eb];W[lb];B[mb];W[sm];B[fm];W[gl];B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[ed];B[fd]
