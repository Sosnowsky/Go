Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[In the last round of the 38th Wangwi league games, Lee Sedol 9p who already won the right to challenge one round earlier defeated Cho Hunhyun 9p by resignation, eliminating the latter from the league.];W[dc];B[dp];W[ce];B[pp]
;W[oc];B[kd]LB[jc:a]C[B7 is Cho Hunhyun's style, the common play is to play the splitting move at 'a'.];W[of];B[qg];W[ic];B[kf]LB[je:a][ie:b]C[As to the counterattack of W10, with B11 for Black to make the diagonal at 'a' or cap with the knight's move at 'b' is relatively common.];W[ph];B[pg];W[og]

;W[rh]C[The sequence from W12 to W28 is an old joseki, Black incurs some territory damage and seems a little over-concentrated.];B[fc]LB[jp:a]C[B29 is a state of mind, but playing at 'a' to form the sanrensei is better, this way Black is easier to give a full play to his thickness at the top.];W[fe]C[The cap of W30 is a good move! Black unexpectedly is hard to answer.];B[ed];W[df];B[hd];W[lc];B[kc];W[kb];B[re]C[As to W34 and W36, Black probes with B37, which is good timing and can't be missed.]
;W[rf];B[rc];W[se]LB[qc:a][mb:b]C[W40: If White wraps up at 'a', then White perhaps needs to capture by reducing liberties, if proceeding as in the game, Black can use White's weakness of tight liberties, striking at 'b' would be effective.];B[pb];W[ob];B[pc];W[qb]LB[mb:a]C[In the process, with W44 if White hangs at 'a' instead, Black will live in gote.];B[rb];W[pa]
;B[qc];W[qa];B[mb];W[gc];B[na];W[oa];B[nd];W[ra];B[dd];W[cd];B[cc];W[cb];B[gd]LB[gb:a]C[The sequence from B55 to B59 is Black's biggest losing cause! No matter whether Black is good or not in the capturing race, Black must hane down at 'a'.]
;W[gb]C[After White stands with W60, Black obtains nothing, Black's territory is already inadequate.];B[ee];W[eb];B[fg]LB[ff:a][jp:b]C[But Black's bad moves are still coming. With B61 and B63 it is indeed inexplicable Black ends in gote! Here Black certainly should hit at 'a', allowing White to cross over, Black gets to play the big point at 'b', this way Black may still have a chance.];W[jq]LB[cp:a]C[With the splitting move of W64, White elects to play simply, in the game White considers the tactic of attaching at 'a', so White captures the corner first. After W64, Black's territory is not enough.];B[hq];W[nq];B[lq];W[no]
;B[kp]C[B69 is an unusual maneuver, if White gets to play the diagonal here, Black would have no way to fight for a victory.];W[pn];B[pr];W[nm];B[qn]C[The attachment of B73 prevents White from entering the corner at 3-3.];W[qm];B[qo];W[fq]LB[hp:a]C[W76 is Lee Sedol's style, to attach out at 'a' is also playable.];B[jp];W[cq];B[dq]
;W[cp];B[do];W[dr];B[er];W[cr];B[eq];W[cn];B[em];W[fr];B[fs];W[di];B[cm];W[bn]
;B[mn]C[With the sequence from B77 to B93, Black's situation takes a better turn.];W[mm];B[lm];W[ln];B[lo]C[With B97, Black can simply retreat at 101.];W[iq];B[gr];W[kn];B[mo];W[ip];B[nn]LB[io:a][hp:b][fp:c]C[But Black's main questionable move is B103, Black should hane at 'a' instead, next W 'b' and B 'c', Black captures cleanly, this way White can use for other purposes, White would be very painful.]
;W[in];B[om];W[fp]C[W106 is a good move!];B[hp];W[ho];B[go];W[gn];B[fo];W[fn];B[eo];W[fl];B[qk];W[dm]C[W116 is a strong move!]
;B[el];W[en];B[dn];W[dl];B[ek];W[dk];B[gl];W[hl];B[gm];W[ll];B[jn]C[B127 is also a good move, but since Black has incurred a big loss in territory, Black can only hope to kill White's big dragon.];W[gk];B[fm]
;W[hn];B[ej];W[dj];B[km];W[il];B[fi]LB[hc:a]C[B153: Black probably can also push and kill at 'a', but the chance is also remote.];W[ir];B[hr];W[hs];B[ko];W[jk];B[gq]
;W[hi];B[ji];W[hg];B[hj];W[gj];B[ij];W[gi];B[gh];W[hh];B[gf];W[hk];B[jg];W[id]C[After White presses with W154, Black already can't completely take tenuki, Black's defeat is already certain.]
