Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[In the first three games, Kono Rin is leading 2:1 in best-of-5 final.];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[fc]
;W[cf];B[od]C[The opening from B1 to B7 is new trend.];W[qn]LB[qk:a]C[W8: For White to split at 'a' is common. In the game, White elects to take territory first then try to reduce moyo.];B[ql];W[qq];B[qp];W[pp];B[rq];W[qr];B[po];W[op]
;B[qo];W[rr];B[no];W[oo];B[on];W[oq];B[pn];W[jd]C[W24 is certainly a good point.];B[ld]C[B25: Black continues to expand moyo.];W[gd]C[W26 is a powerful move in this situation.];B[fd]C[From B27 to W52, White can fight, since White extends out in the front, Black is painful. But where to play B27 is really a difficult question.]

;W[me];B[nf]C[The play of B53 and B55 is far-fetched, since they are too damaging to territory.];W[kg];B[lh];W[qc];B[pc]LB[qk:a]C[If White doesn't exchange W58 and B59 and directly attaches at 'a', Black is more difficult to handle.];W[qk]C[W60: White attaches inside, Black couldn't kill White.];B[qi]C[B61: Black couldn't make decision to kill White.];W[mf];B[ng]
;W[pl];B[qm];W[nk]TR[nf][lg]C[But White goes away easily with W64 and W66. Black clearly fails in the fight with B53 and B55.];B[ke];W[je];B[lf];W[le];B[kd];W[kh]C[W70 and W72 are very damaging. White should directly escape as in the real game. White can tolerate if Black turns head in the center.];B[lj];W[ki]
;B[li];W[qj];B[pi];W[nm];B[nn];W[mm];B[kb];W[ln];B[lp]LB[or:a]C[The shape of B83 is not right. Black should play hane at 'a' to seek tempo of playing.];W[jo];B[jq];W[cj]LB[mq:a]C[W86 is Kono Rin's top-rated strong move. In fact, if White jump to 'a' first, Black is already very painful.]
;B[ei];W[bi];B[fj];W[gj];B[gk];W[hk];B[gl];W[el];B[ck];W[dm]C[From W80 to W96, White continues to carry over his attacking intention.];B[he]C[But the probe of B97 makes White difficult.];W[hf]LB[hj:a][id:b]C[W98: If White connects at 'a', then Black can cross over in sente by playing wedge at 'b'.]
;B[hc];W[id];B[ic]LB[hj:a][jm:b]C[B101 is slow move! Black's big dragon is very resilient and shouldn't be afraid of being attacked. Now Black should cut and play atari at 'a', then counterattack at 'b', which is just imperative in this situation.];W[mq]C[In the game, White gets to act first with W102, the situation becomes completely different.];B[lo];W[jm];B[hj];W[gi];B[ll];W[kn]
;B[lq];W[jc];B[jb];W[eq];B[hl];W[hq];B[ik]C[B113 and B115 are over simplified, Black should first probe White in the lower right corner.];W[ho];B[bj];W[di];B[dj];W[ci];B[cm]
;W[cn];B[dl];W[bm];B[cl];W[kr];B[lr];W[jr];B[nr];W[or];B[nq];W[en]C[W132: White completely encloses the corner territory, Black already shows losing trend.];B[db];W[cb]C[The following endgame already has nothing to do with the outcome of the game.]
;B[oj];W[ok]C[Yamashita Keigo 9p, as Kisei, lost the series by 1:3, showing Japanese Go arena is currently chaotic, not sure when dominators like Cho Chikun and Kobayashi Koichi will appear again!];B[fm];W[em];B[jp];W[ip];B[ri];W[rl];B[rj];W[rk];B[pj];W[pk];B[in]
