Translation:GoGameWorld.];B[pd]C[First, I should thank to Weiqi Journal for their warm invitation and give me the chance to come back and comment on Go games. During the past several years, because of health problems, I couldn't participate in the practice and competitions, and lost contacts with our Go fans. Although I still can not play in Go tournaments now, but I'm feeling very happy that I could communicate with Go fans and friends through one corner of Weiqi Journal. Next I will introduce the game 1 of the 17th Chinese Tianyuan Title final between Huang Yizhong and Gu Li.];W[dd];B[pp];W[dq];B[do]

(;B[dp]LB[cn:a][cp:b][fc:c][cf:d][dm:e][fq:f][ci:g][jc:h][db:i][cc:j][hc:k]C[After W6, the hit of B7 is a play to invite fights. Black's hane at 'a' is also playable, after White draws back at 'b', Black can approach the corner at 'c', followed by W 'd', B 'e', W 'f', B 'g', W 'h', B 'i', W 'j' and B 'k', this sequence is more popular nowadays (see var a).];W[cp];B[eq]
;W[cn];B[dn];W[dm]LB[cm:a]C[W12: White can also extend to 'a', this would be more steady.];B[cq]C[The atari of B13 is inevitable.];W[dr];B[bq];W[cr]LB[er:a]C[After Black stands with B15, White turns with W16, this will lead to the complicated "large avalanche" inner turn joseki. W16 can also be played as the outer turn at 'a'.];B[cm];W[cl]
;B[br];W[er];B[bm];W[bn];B[bl];W[bp];B[fq];W[dl]LB[fr:a]C[After Black extends with B25, the connection of W26 is a novel play, this move can also be considered to crawl at 'a', this is more solid.];B[ap];W[ao];B[fr];W[bk]
;B[cs]C[In the game, the sequence up to 31 is relatively new, I personally think this local variation is a little favorable for Black.];W[fc];B[mc];W[qn];B[mq]LB[np:a]C[B35: Black can also consider to jump at 'a', this is relatively solid.];W[qj];B[ql];W[rl];B[bd]C[B39 is a good move at this time.];W[cd];B[be]
;W[bc];B[cg];W[bi];B[eg]C[Through 45, Black has effectively destroyed White's moyo on the left, Black is favorable for the game.];W[qc];B[pc];W[qd];B[qe];W[re]
(;B[rf]LB[qf:a][qg:b][pl:c][qb:d][rb:e][pb:f][rg:g][qh:h]C[The double hane of B51 is territory-oriented play, but this is the losing move for the game. For Black to extend at 'a' is solid, if White crawls at 51, then Black extends to 'b', the clamp of W 'c' is necessary, followed by B 'd', W 'e', B 'f', W 'g' and B 'h', Black is very thick, thus the game would be a little favorable for Black (see var a).];W[qf];B[pe];W[rg];B[rd];W[sf]C[After taking one stone with W56, White has became very thick and White also has indirectly strengthened White's stones in the lower right, so far White already has caught up with Black.]
;B[rc];W[qq]C[W58 is the biggest point on the board.];B[pq]LB[qp:a]C[The block of B59 is steady, this move can also be played at 'a', but at this situation it is not that feasible.];W[qp];B[po];W[qo]C[After White connects with W62, White has grabbed a lot of territory, both sides are about even in the game.];B[bb]LB[hc:a]C[The clamp of B63 is a good move, although Black has lost 2 or 3 points in the corner, but it makes the clamp of B 'a' more powerful.];W[ac];B[hc]
;W[gc]LB[fb:a]C[W66: White aims to prevent Black from sliding under at 'a'.];B[hd];W[df];B[dg];W[ge];B[gh];W[gg];B[hg];W[hf];B[hh];W[if];B[kd]C[Through 77, the outcome in the upper left corner is even, both sides are acceptable.]
;W[kq]C[The invasion of W78 is a special play in this situation.];B[pn];W[ko];B[rk]LB[km:a]C[B81 seems an overplay, Black should cap at 'a', this would lead to a half-point winning/losing game.];W[qm]C[The hit and cut of W82 is severe.];B[pl];W[pm];B[om];W[ol];B[pk];W[on]
;B[nm];W[nn]C[After this move, it is time for noon break.];B[mm]LB[mn:a]C[It appears unreasonable for Black to initiate a fight here, B91 at 'a' is better.];W[mn];B[kr];W[nk];B[lm];W[np];B[nq];W[jr];B[lr]
;W[pj];B[kn];W[ln];B[ok];W[oj];B[nl];W[qk];B[jo];W[jp];B[lo];W[lp];B[kp]C[Through 111, a ko fight results, the situation is not clear.];W[op]
;B[oq];W[ko];B[cc];W[km];B[dc];W[jn];B[ed];W[ee];B[ec];W[jd]LB[jg:a]C[W122 is not appropriate, the best play is for White to make the diagonal's extension at 'a'.];B[jc];W[je]
;B[jg]C[B125 is severe, White now feels constricted.];W[ke];B[ld];W[ic];B[jb];W[le];B[mk];W[ol];B[nj];W[md];B[hb];W[pr];B[or]
;W[qr]C[W136 and W138: White hanes and connects in sente.];B[ok]LB[ks:a]C[B139: Black can also directly make life by playing at 'a'.];W[kh]LB[hr:a][nd:b]C[W140: If White jumps to 'a', then Black could atari at 'b', White's big dragon on the left would be dangerous and may get killed.];B[js]LB[ks:a]C[B141 is the last losing move, Black should stand at 'a'.];W[ks]C[The throw-in of W141 is clever! due to the mistake of B141, Black at the bottom has to live by a ko fight, the game for Black is as good as lost.];B[is]

After White links back at 'a', because it is a flower-viewing ko, White has nothing to lose, so White only need to take some advantage somewhere else, Black's territory would be inadequate. However, in the situation, White's ko threats are obviously much more than Black's, then the only move left for Black is to concede defeat.]
