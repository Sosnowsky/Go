(;SZ[19]EV[13th Fujitsu Cup final]DT[2000-08-12]PB[Cho Hunhyun]PW[Chang Hao]BR[9p]WR[9p]RE[B+R]C[Commentary by Nie Weiping 9p and Rin Kaiho 9p.
Copyright by gogameworld.com and weiqi.tom.com.];B[pd]C[Nie Weiping 9p and Rin Kaiho 9p, who are participating 2000 Yanhuang Cup Mingren Invitational Tournament in Guizhou, China, are very concerned about this final, after the conclusion of the opening ceremony of Yanhuang Cup in the morning, they immediately start to comment on this game through the internet from their hotel.];W[dp];B[qp];W[dd];B[fq]C[It is very obvious that Black aims to form the "Mini Chinese" fuseki, certainly now (even earlier), White has many ways to foil Black's plan.];W[cn]
;B[kq]C[So far, this is the most popular opening nowadays. While taking Black, Cho Hunhyun almost always elects this opening if not being disrupted by his opponents. Before long, he defeated Zhou Heyang 9p by using this opening.];W[qj];B[qf]LB[qg:a]C[The small knight of B9 is seldom seen, the common play is to make the large knight's move at 'a'.];W[qm];B[pn];W[qn];B[qo];W[lp]LB[ol:a][qg:b][qc:c]C[W14: Now for White to make the knight's move at 'a' is usual, but considering that Black has made a small knight instead of a large knight's move at 'b', after White becomes thick, the severeness of entering the corner at 'c' has been lessened, so Chang Hao elects to make the diagonal's extension directly, it is understandable that he may worry that nothing would come of it.]
;B[pm];W[pl];B[ol];W[pk];B[kp];W[lo];B[ko];W[ln];B[ok];W[oj];B[nj];W[oi]LB[qg:a]C[Black doesn't hesitate to play a hane, because Black has played the small knight rather than at 'a', so it is playable.]
;B[jm]C[The knight's move of B27 is a coherent and inevitable move.];W[om]C[As the Go proverb says, something will happen at the cut.];B[oo]
(;W[nm]LB[on:a][po:b][ml:c][nk:d][kl:e]C[Rin Kaiho: White should atari at 'a', then B 'b', W 'c', B 'd' and W 'e'.
Nie Weiping: This variation is obviously superior to the real game (see var a).];B[ml];W[kn];B[jn]LB[nl:a]C[Only from the shape, the push is a crude play, but in order to guarantee that White gets to play at 'a', White has no alternative.];W[nl];B[nk];W[mk]C[The subsequent play is one way street.]
;B[mj];W[lk];B[mm];W[nn];B[lj];W[kk];B[kj];W[jk];B[jj];W[ik];B[lq]C[B47: The turn is vital so that the two black leftover stones can be utilized, White has to exercise his patience and could't use any strength.];W[no];B[np]C[Nie: Black has enclosed the lower-side territory and can be satisfied.]
;W[ij];B[jh];W[hh]C[Through W52, Black has obtained more territory and Black's speed is faster, thus Black is easier to take control of the situation.];B[qh]LB[rk:a][rj:b][rm:c]C[Before reinforcing the center, Black first makes the one-space extension, Black is aiming at the maneuver of B 'a', W 'b' and B 'c'.];W[pg]C[White answers with a peep, it is also quite normal, Black must tenuki to play in the center.];B[je]C[Rin Kaiho: So far, Cho Hunhyun's style is evident, Black's speed is very fast.];W[pf];B[qg]
;W[pe];B[qe];W[od];B[pc];W[nf]C[White bumps then hanes with W58 and W60, although Black has obtained territory, but it also shows Chang Hao's style of thickness.];B[oc]C[The turn of B63 is a move that can represent Cho's tough style. Generally, Black should strengthen the center, but before doing it, to turn here first is very huge and enticing.
Nie: This move is very greedy, from the state of the mind, White should punish Black.];W[md];B[lf]C[After playing the turn at 63, Black comes back to reinforce, Nie 9p thinks the left-side big point is huge, White needs to obtain sente by pressing the opponent.];W[he]LB[ie:a]C[After White's big jump, Black can tenuki, the next move to split the left side is inevitable. Lin Kaiho 9p has showed the variations after attaching at 'a', it is more complicated.];B[ch]C[The splitting move is inevitable.]
;W[cj];B[be];W[ce];B[bd];W[cg];B[cf];W[df];B[bf];W[dg];B[bg];W[cc];B[bi];W[bj]LB[dh:a][ci:b][di:c]C[Nie: The block of W80 places more importance on the left side, it is not good, White should push at 'a', then B 'b', W 'c' and B 80, then White can tenuki, White already has enclosed a considerable territory in the center and still has the chance to attack Black's weak stones, White can fight.]
;B[cd];W[dc];B[de];W[ee];B[dh]C[So far, here White is already not easy to handle.];W[io];B[dr]LB[jo:a][iq:b][mq:c][mp:d][mr:e][nq:f][jq:g][cq:h]C[Nie: White now should directly cut at 'a', if B 'b', White would already have taken advantage. If Black makes the diagonal's extension at 3-3, White can hane down at 'c', then B 'd', W 'e', B 'f' and White has the tactic of attaching at 'g' to reduce liberties (see var a).]

(;W[fp];B[gq];W[gp];B[jo];W[cq];B[hp]C[White has clearly suffered some losses with the sequence from 88 to 93.
Rin Kaiho: It equals to helping Black reinforce with one move.
Nie: These several moves are very bad, White is not good.];W[kg]LB[ci:a]C[Now Black is way out front in territory, White couldn't obtain adequate territory if just playing the normal endgame.
Lin Kaiho: White needs to create the winning chance by attack the center black stones and tries to destroy eyes at 'a' to kill Black, although Cho Hunhyun likes sabaki plays and is not fearful of death, but White doesn't have adequate territory and has no other choice.
];B[lg];W[jg];B[kh];W[ig]LB[ci:a]C[Nie: White should initiate the chase-and-destroy by playing at 'a', this is the only chance for White, although there is no guarantee whether it is successful, but White has to do this way, Chang Hao doesn't play well in the game.]

;B[cr];W[kd];B[ke];W[jd];B[of];W[oe];B[lc];W[ld];B[lb]C[Both Black's weak groups are safe, now the game is over. The following moves have nothing to do with the outcome of the game and the comments are omitted.];W[nf];B[ni];W[mg];B[ii]
