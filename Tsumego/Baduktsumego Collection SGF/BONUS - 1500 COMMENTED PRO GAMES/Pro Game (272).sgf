;W[ce];B[df];W[dd]LB[cf:a]C[W8: If White crawls at 'a', then Black would bump at 8 and it would lead to the large avalanche joseki, the position of B1 and B3 would be favorable for Black.];B[cf];W[be];B[qn];W[qp];B[pj];W[oc]LB[nc:a][mc:b]C[W14: For White to approach with the large knight's move at 'a' is better, because after Black tightly pincers at 'b', Black would be favorable in the fight.]
;B[mc];W[pd]LB[pe:a]C[W16 seems a crude move, however if White makes the common knight's move at 'a', after being pushed and cut by B 16, White would be inadequate.];B[qc];W[pf];B[qe];W[nf];B[qg]C[Through Black's jump of B21, White has suffered some losses in territory.];W[ld];B[nc]C[B23 is a good move!];W[pg]LB[lc:a][ob:b]C[W24: If White blocks at 'a', after Black bridges over at 'b', White would accomplish nothing.]
;B[qh];W[qf];B[rf];W[re];B[rg];W[ob]C[The stand of W30 is a momentum play.];B[me];W[qb]C[The attachment of W32 is a clever play!]
(;B[le]LB[rb:a][lf:b][ne:c][rc:d][rd:e][mf:f]C[B33: If Black hanes at 'a', then W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 'e' and W 'f', after these several exchanges, Black can no longer squeeze and separate White (see var a).];W[jd]LB[rb:a]C[But the jump of W34 is inexplicable, it is almost the losing move! Why not making the extension at 'a'? it is a big move and also White can settle himself, it is hard to understand!];B[rb]TR[qb]C[After Black hanes back at 35, the originally good move (the marked white stone) becomes mediocre. White sinks into a bitter battle.];W[lc]
;B[ne];W[pc];B[je];W[ie];B[jf];W[id];B[lb];W[pe];B[rc];W[nh];B[if];W[hf]LB[nj:a]C[W48: For White to jump to 'a' is the proper move.]
;B[hg];W[gf]C[After this move, it is time for lunch break.];B[mi]C[B51 is severe! White is not easy to get out.];W[ni];B[mj];W[ok];B[oj];W[nj];B[nk];W[lh];B[mk];W[ih]

;B[gg];W[gi];B[ff]LB[ij:a][hi:b][ii:c][hj:d][gh:e][fg:f]C[The hane of B75 seems a little hasty, Black should first strike at 'a' to probe White, if W 'b', then B 75; If White bumps at 'c', then B 'd', W 'e' and B 'f'.];W[gd];B[gk]C[The play of B77 takes some risk, under a clearly favorable situation, this is unnecessary.];W[ij];B[ik]
;W[jk];B[il];W[gj];B[fk];W[ei]LB[fh:a][fg:b][dh:c]C[The play of W82 and W84 is too slow! Now White should make the diagonal's extension at 'a', then B 'b' and W 'c', only by exerting more pressure on Black, White would get a chance of winning.];B[ra];W[qa];B[ci]C[So far, this game was closed for the first day. Black has used 3 hours and 4 minutes, White 4 hours and 7 minutes.];W[ch]
;B[fd]C[B89 is alert!];W[fe]LB[fc:a][fh:b]C[W90: If White blocks at 'a', Black's connection at 90 is sente, Black then can hang at 'b'. In the game, the wedge of W90 seems a little unconvincing too.];B[ee];W[ge];B[eg];W[dh];B[cd]LB[ed:a][bf:b][gb:c][jb:d]C[The cut of B95 is unnecessary! If White simple connects at 'a', White can't tenuki to turn at 'b', otherwise after B 'c', White's big group would be dead. If White still reinforces at 'd', Black can simply block at 'b', the aji in White's corner would be much worse.]
;W[fh];B[fg];W[bd];B[ed];W[jb]LB[ib:a]C[W100: For White to jump to 'a' is the right move.];B[bf];W[bg];B[kb]C[After Black connects at 103, White again has to live painfully.];W[hb];B[db];W[cb]
;B[ec];W[cc];B[jc];W[fb];B[eb];W[fc];B[ki];W[kh];B[ib];W[ic];B[ja];W[ck]C[After this move, it is time for lunch break. Black still has 3 hours and 58 minutes in the regular time and White 2 hours and 6 minutes.
];B[jq]LB[jl:a]C[Although the extension of B119 is a big point, but the turn at 'a' would be thicker.]
;W[dn]LB[fp:a][jl:b][on:c][im:d]C[The exchange of W120 for B 'a is not good, White should simply press at 'b', then B 'c' and W 'd', this way maybe White still have the winning chance.];B[fp];W[jl];B[on];W[im];B[fn];W[hm];B[en]TR[dn][fp]C[Because of the exchange of the marked white and black stone, Black handles lightly with B125 and B127, White will lose the game for sure.]
