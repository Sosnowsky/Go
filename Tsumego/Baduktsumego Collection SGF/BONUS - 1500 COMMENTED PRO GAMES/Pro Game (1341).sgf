;W[eq];B[do];W[iq];B[cf];W[ch];B[ck]C[Black's opening is very steady, not like some young players who are eager to fight when facing "world #1".];W[df]LB[ce:a]C[W12: White can also consider to bump with the diagonal at 'a'.];B[nq]LB[qn:a][de:b]C[In the game B13 kind of serves as ladder breaker, if White answers at around 'a', Black plans to wedge at 'b'.];W[cg]C[But after White strengthens with W14, Black gets to double approach, this way Black's tempo is fast.]

;B[lp];W[kp];B[mp]TR[kq][kr]LB[rs:a]C[The retreat of B55 is a good move, allowing White to capture the marked two stones, thus Black can force White to make life at 'a', Black is very happy.];W[jq];B[ko];W[jp];B[rm];W[ro];B[ln]C[After this move, it is time for lunch break.]

;B[mk];W[ec];B[cc]C[B77 entering the corner is very alert, locally White is not good to exert power.];W[cd];B[eb];W[db];B[fb];W[cb];B[ic];W[pe]LB[ne:a]C[W84: For White to jump at 'a' is steady, and it will lead to a close situation.];B[of]C[Black counterattacks with B85, the situation suddenly becomes intense.]

;B[ri];W[sc]LB[mf:a]C[W100: White crosses over and makes life, it is very big, but White must face Black's strong attack at 'a'.];B[mf];W[mg];B[kh];W[jf];B[ng];W[mi];B[lh];W[mh];B[if];W[je]
;B[kd];W[lf];B[sd];W[sb];B[pb];W[ra];B[ke];W[jd];B[jc];W[ie]LB[kf:a]C[W118 and W120 must be miscalculation. Because after Black pushes at 'a', White's liberty is not enough in the capturing race, perhaps White thinks it will be a ko. With W118 at any rate White can only connect at 'a', for Black to capture White is also not that easy, but the play in the game leads to a fast defeat.];B[kf];W[nd]
