;B[fq];W[hq];B[cf];W[cd];B[ci];W[eq]LB[fp:a][ep:b][eo:c][gp:d][dq:e][cp:f][cq:g][bp:h][bq:i][gr:j][fr:k][fn:l]TR[ci]C[If W10 attaches at 'a', then B 'b', W 'c', B 10, W 'd', B 'e', W 'f', B 'g', W 'h', B 'i', W 'j', B 'k' and W 'l', although White gets a solid outside thickness, however, due to existense of the marked stone, the power of this thickness will substantially abates.] 
;B[fp];W[dn];B[jq];W[ck];B[hp];W[fr]C[W16 seems slow.];B[gr];W[er];B[qn]C[Through 19, Black's opening is fast and can be satisfied.];W[hr];B[ip];W[nc] 
;B[pf];W[jd];B[nm]LB[ef:a][pj:b][on:c]C[B25 is unexpected, jumping to 'a' or making an extension at around 'b' is common, B25 prevents White's tactic of capping and reduction at 'c'.];W[qh];B[qj];W[oh];B[qg];W[qo]C[W30 probes White.];B[ro]LB[qp:a][op:b]C[B31 is very strong and tough, if White pulls back at 'a', Black can initiate a severe attack at 'b'.] 
;W[mh];B[me];W[lc];B[kh]LB[li:a][jj:b][lk:c][lm:d]C[B35's purpose is to achieve solidness at the bottom by attacking White, if proceeding like W 'a', B 'b', W 'c' and B 'd', this fits Black's plan precisely. The time both sides has used so far is almost same, about 30 minutes.];W[rh];B[oj]C[Through 37, from the standpoint of the whole board configuration, Black appears very vivid.];W[qe];B[pe];W[rg] 
;B[qd]LB[ph:a]C[After 41, Black aims to wedge and cut at 'a'.];W[nj];B[nk];W[oi];B[mj]C[B45 is an inevitable counter-attack.];W[pj];B[ni];W[pk];B[nh];W[qm];B[pn] 
;W[rm]C[As for the result up to 52, White is not favorable, Black has advantage in both territory and outside thickness.];B[hc]C[The invasion of B53 seeks to bring his outside thickness into play.];W[ic];B[hd];W[rn];B[rp];W[ee]C[W58 is slow-footed.];B[ob]LB[hg:a]C[B59 is fierce and malicious, the usual move is jumping at 'a'.];W[jf];B[ff]LB[hf:a][jh:b]C[B61 is a good move, if jumping at 'a', then White can take the opportunity to lean out at 'b', this is not good for Black.] 
;W[ef]C[W62 looks like a crude move.];B[fg];W[eg];B[fh];W[di];B[dj];W[ei];B[cj];W[cl];B[ih]C[Through 71, Black not only connects and also makes his territorial framework in the center more powerful, White has obviously failed in the fight.];W[nb]C[W72 still needs to reinforce in gote, White suffers dearly.];B[be] 
;W[fi];B[bc];W[bd];B[ad];W[bb];B[bg];W[ch];B[bh]C[Through 81, Black lives completely on the left, Black's advantage becomes clear.];W[hg];B[ie]C[Both sides enters overtime.];W[je];B[ig]

;B[ge]C[Through 99, judging by pros in the study room, Black has almost 75 points and White has only about 60 points, Black is favorable.];W[cc]LB[af:a]C[W100 is hard to understand, at the current moment, regardless of danger White should play at 'a' to fight desperately with Black.];B[fk];W[eh];B[dk];W[el];B[dl];W[dm];B[fm];W[fl];B[gl] 
;W[ek];B[ej];W[em];B[fj];W[fn];B[ab]C[B115 pushes on in the flush of victory by playing the flower-viewing ko with White. Black wins the game for sure, Kim SeungJun is apparently not in the mood today.];W[ac];B[ib];W[jb];B[bc];W[hb];B[gb];W[ia] 
;B[fc];W[ac];B[ed];W[de];B[bc];W[gh];B[gg];W[ac];B[cm]C[Hu Yaoyu will face one Japanese player on 11/28.])
