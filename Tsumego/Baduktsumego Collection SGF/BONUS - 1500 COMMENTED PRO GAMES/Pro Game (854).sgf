Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[qd]C[In this game, Xie He 6p clearly didn't give a play to his talent, in the early stage of the game, he made some miscalculation.];W[dc];B[pp];W[dp];B[ce]
;W[ci];B[pj]LB[cn:a]C[B7 is a surprising move, for Black to approach the corner at 'a' is common. This move was once played in the game between Gu Li and Lee Sedol.];W[cd];B[de];W[fd];B[eh];W[dj];B[hd];W[fc]LB[ec:a]C[W14 is calm. It appears slow but in fact it means to strike later after accumulating power, it eliminates Black's crosscut at 'a', and Black's outside is also not thick.];B[ej]
;W[ek];B[fj];W[fk]LB[dk:a][ff:b]C[W18: White can consider to connect at 'a', this is just  a calm and good move. Later on White can jump out at 'b', the whole black group is still a little thin.];B[gk];W[gj]C[After Black hanes with B19, White must cut with W20.];B[gh]C[But Black's jump of B21 is good shape, White doesn't have any powerful follow-up tactic.];W[hj]LB[dl:a]C[W22: In the study room, people say White should hang at 'a'. The play in the game is also a state of mind.];B[dk]
;W[dl];B[ck];W[cl];B[bj];W[bl];B[gl];W[el];B[bi];W[ch]LB[fe:a][il:b]C[W32 is a big miscalculation! Xie He overlooks Black's attachment at 'a'. Here White is over-zealous, White should make the knight's move at 'b', threatening Black's two stones B19 and B29, this is just the correct direction for playing.];B[cj];W[di]
;B[bh];W[cg];B[bg];W[fg];B[fh];W[eg];B[fe];W[ge]C[Xie He can only give up five stones, Black takes a big profit!];B[dg];W[ee];B[ed];W[ff];B[df]
;W[oc];B[dd];W[cc];B[ld];W[nq]LB[jp:a][il:b]C[W52: White should make extension at 'a', next W52 and 'b' become miai, White must get one to play.];B[lp]C[The pincer of B53 is inevitable.];W[no];B[pn];W[jp];B[ln]
;W[nm]LB[nk:a][ol:b]C[After jumping twice with W54 and W58, White already can't continue to jump at 'a', otherwise Black will peep at 'b' in sente, then enclose territory, White is still not alive.];B[ll];W[km];B[lm];W[pq]C[W62 is bait.];B[op];W[np];B[oq];W[lq];B[or]
;W[kp]C[Through W68, although White crosses over, but Black's profit is huge with B65 and B67! Black is clearly favorable.];B[il];W[eq];B[io];W[of];B[qf];W[qc];B[od];W[pc];B[oe];W[rd];B[re];W[ql]C[W80 is a game-deciding move.]
;B[rn]LB[ol:a]C[B81 is slow! Black should cap at 'a', White will be very painful, even if White lives painfully on the side, Black's outside thickness is significant, the outcome of game is already decided.];W[ok];B[ip]LB[lo:a]C[B83 is also slow, if Black connects at 'a', White's situation will deteriorate.];W[kn];B[kl];W[lo];B[fp];W[fq];B[cp];W[co]
;B[cq];W[bo];B[fn]C[With B87, B89 and B93, Black tries to reinforce his weakness in the middle. Black has strong favorable consciousness.];W[eo]LB[oj:a][pk:b][do:c]C[W94 is the last losing move! White should press at 'a', to strengthen the defect of B 'b', this way White may still have a chance to win. Even if Black cuts at 'c', at least White will capture two stones B89 and B91 by reducing liberties.];B[pk]C[B95: Black is very happy.];W[pl];B[ol];W[om];B[nl]C[After separating W82, Black becomes very thick, White already has no way to turn the game around.]
;W[pm];B[nk];W[kf]C[In the following process, White's sequence following W102 is unusual maneuver, White hopes to take Black into a capturing race, but Black is really thick and White is thin, in the end White gains nothing.];B[nc];W[nb];B[mb];W[mc];B[nd];W[lb];B[md];W[ma];B[je];W[oj]
