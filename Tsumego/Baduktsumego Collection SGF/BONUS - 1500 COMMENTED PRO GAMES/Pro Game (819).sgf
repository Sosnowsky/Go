Edited and translated by GoGameWorld.com.];B[pd]C[This is the final game 7 of 30th Japanese Meijin Title between Kobayashi Satoru and the defending champion Cho U Meijin.];W[dd];B[pp];W[dp]C[Through W4, both sides start with two-star points.];B[cf]
;W[fc];B[dj];W[cl]C[W8 is a positive way to face fight.];B[pj]LB[fq:a]C[B9: If Black approaches the corner at 'a' first, observing how White to play, it is relatively common, in the real game Black forms sanrensei, the situation is not easy to control.
];W[nq]C[W10 approaching the corner is inevitable.];B[lq]C[B11: Black definitely is not willing to fall behind.];W[lp];B[kq];W[no];B[pn]
;W[kp];B[jp];W[mq];B[iq];W[jr];B[jq];W[pr];B[fq]C[Through B23, both sides play very steadily.];W[fp]C[The press of W24 is a local good move.];B[ep];W[eo];B[eq]C[The wedge and connection of B25 and B27 are correct moves.]
;W[do]LB[dq:a]C[W28: White can only connect, if White blocks at 'a', Black will cut at 28.];B[dq];W[cq];B[ck];W[dl];B[bl];W[bm];B[qq];W[nc]C[B35 and W36 are miai points, Black can elect to play either, each has its own pros and cons.];B[pf];W[kd]
;B[ef]LB[nd:a]C[B39: Black has state of mind to press at 'a'.];W[bd]C[After this move, it is time for lunch break.];B[ce];W[cd]C[With the exchange of B39, B41 and W40, W42, Black's loss in territory is huge.];B[nd];W[md];B[oc];W[ne];B[od];W[nb];B[me]
;W[mf];B[le];W[ld]C[White first plays atari with W50 then connects with W52, it is playing tempo.];B[lf];W[lg];B[je]C[Black fights directly with B53 and B55, it is inevitable.];W[ng];B[jf]LB[mh:a][nh:b][mg:c][kg:d]C[The order of B57 is wrong! Now Black should first strike at 'a', next: if White presses at 'b', then Black can cut at 'c', then play atari at 'd', Black will be favorable in the fight; If White connects at 'c', then Black can double up with B57, White's shape will be heavy, Black is better.]
;W[ob];B[qc];W[ic];B[mh]C[Now for Black to strike with B61 is already late.];W[nh]C[Now W62 becomes a good move.];B[ph]LB[mg:a][mi:b]C[Now if Black cuts at 'a', White will counter-atari at 'b', the early exchange of B57 and W60 is not tolerable for Black.];W[mi];B[jh];W[ki]C[White runs away easily with W64 and W66, Black doesn't gain his imagined result.]
;B[nm];W[qr];B[ji];W[nk];B[rr]C[Black's attacking tempo with B67, B69 and B71 is a little chaotic.];W[ol];B[nn];W[ql]C[After White enters into Black's right side with W72 and W74, White is clearly favorable in territory.];B[op];W[lr];B[kr];W[ls]
;B[ns];W[nr];B[ks];W[os];B[qk];W[kk];B[kl];W[lk]C[After this move, the game was closed for the first day.];B[mj]C[B87 is a game-deciding move.];W[mk];B[lm]LB[np:a][li:b]C[B89 is slow, now if Black doesn't exchange with W 'a' and plays at 'b' instead in the center, the situation will be slightly messy.]
;W[np];B[li];W[ni];B[lh];W[ik];B[kh];W[pk];B[qj];W[pm];B[qn];W[oj];B[rl];W[jl]C[After White hangs with W102, Black already loses attacking target.]
;B[kn];W[mn]LB[mm:a]C[The hane of W104 is a good move, if Black connects at 'a', White at the bottom already lives in sente.];B[mo];W[on];B[in];W[om]C[After White connects with W106 and W108, Black is already in a losing situation.];B[qm];W[gp];B[mm];W[im];B[jm]
;W[hm];B[gq];W[hp];B[jo];W[hq];B[hr];W[dr];B[er];W[gr];B[gs];W[es];B[fr]C[After this move, it is time for lunch break.];W[bh]C[White again plays the good moves such as W112 and W126, the game completely becomes White's one side show.]
