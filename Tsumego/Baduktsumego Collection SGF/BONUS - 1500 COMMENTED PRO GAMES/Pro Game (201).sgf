;B[pb];W[pa];B[qa];W[oa];B[rb];W[gc]C[Through W64, Yang Yi (chairman of Chongqing Weiqi Association, which achieved five consecutive champions in Chinese National Go Team Competition, which Gu Li belongs to.) thinks, W64 is a strong move, Black has no other choice but to descend, if Black plays the hane on the second line, White will cut, the game would be very difficult for Black.];B[fb];W[si];B[sh];W[sj];B[rh];W[hr];B[gd]
;W[hi];B[en];W[fo];B[fj];W[fl];B[fk];W[fm];B[em]C[Through B79, Rin Kaiho 9p thinks: Black and White have all played very confidently, White looks specially tenacious and refuses to yield an inch.

;B[ie]LB[je:a][gh:b][hh:c][hg:d]C[B85 is a good move, if White plays at 'a', then B 'b', W 'c' and B 'd', White will get separated.];W[ig];B[cp];W[cq];B[jb];W[ib];B[lb]C[Through B91, Yang Yi thinks, there is a loophole on the left with the push of B57 and also in the upper left corner.];W[ic]LB[kd:a]C[If W92 at 'a', then Black will cut at 92, White is no good.]
;B[kd];W[je];B[ke];W[kf]C[Through W96, it leads to a decisive fight.];B[jf]LB[lf:a][ld:b][kg:c][if:d][lc:e][kb:f][mb:g]C[B97 is the correct move, if Black cuts at 'a', then W 'b', B97, W 'c', B 'd', W 'e', B 'f' and W 'g', Black would be killed.];W[if]LB[ld:a][id:b]C[If W98 at 'a', then Black will reduce liberties at 'b', White is one liberty short in the capturing race.]
;B[lf];W[kg];B[me];W[lg];B[mf];W[ng];B[ia];W[ha];B[ja]C[Through B107, top pros in the study room think, now it is a game-deciding life-and-death fight, after this war, the game would be basically over.];W[oh];B[pg];W[la]C[Wang Runan 8p thinks that Black's big dragon at the top is alive and Gu Li has succeeded. Wang Yi 5p thinks, Gu Li must have calculated when he dares kill out, just making life is not his style.]
;B[ma];W[mb];B[mc];W[na];B[kb];W[gb];B[ld];W[nd];B[md];W[nh]C[Through W120, Kato Masao 9p of Japan and Kim In 9p of Korea all think: if nothing unexpected will happen, Gu Li wins the game for sure. Because Black has made life at the top, White can't enclose the center, Black can stick his head out both at the top and in the middle, so White's potential in the center is limited.
];B[gn]C[Hua Xueming 7p thinks, Won 5p is very indomitable in the second half of the game, Gu Li can't underestimate the enemy.

;W[aq]C[Through W146, Yang Yi thinks, the situation is not clear again, B145 is over-steady and slow. Rin Kaiho 9p agrees with it.];B[lr];W[lq];B[mp];W[kr];B[ms];W[sp];B[sq];W[so];B[rq];W[ok];B[ol];W[nj]

;B[ho];W[jn];B[gi];W[gh];B[jr]C[Through B189, after calculation, Rin Kaiho 9p thinks Black is slightly better.];W[js];B[jq];W[ir];B[jp];W[hc];B[go];W[gp];B[hf]
;W[hg];B[gf];W[po]C[Through W200, after counting points, Wang Runan 8p and Hua Xueming 7p thinks that the game is to Black's advantage but it is limited.];B[fa];W[ga];B[pi];W[ae]C[Through B204, the game enters into the intense endgame phase.];B[mn];W[ln];B[oi];W[ni];B[mg]
;W[mh];B[ad];W[ag];B[qn];W[rn];B[ai];W[oo];B[np]C[Through B217, Wang Runan said that Black is only leading about 6-7 points on the board, it is a half-point game!];W[ls]C[Rin 9p also thinks Black basically will win the game by half point, the result subjects to the last ko fight.

Perhaps Won also saw it and thought anyway it is a loss, why not trying for the last time? After carefully examining the whole board, Gu Li saw clearly that he had one more ko threat than Won and thus had relaxed a little bit. After the ko, Black wins by two more points, Gu Li feels very lucky.];W[ka]C[Black wins by 2.5 points, on 2/12, Gu Li will face the challenge from one Japanese player.])
