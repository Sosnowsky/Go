PW[Sosnovsky (2131)]PB[Manja Marz (2304)]C[During this game I was quite affected emotionally by the previous one, to some extent I didn't feel like playing Go, just wanted to lose quickly and go cry to my room :)

However, this is an ideal game to get recovered! :) In such a game you didn't risk anything, you can just make an upset. ]

yeah, the game is immediately over, very nice turnaround! it's possible that you would win even without this black's blunder

Very mature and interesting complex game, full of high quality and AI moves, this was definitely not a lower-dan level game

From this game you should learn to pay attention on urgent places (L16, K4, R4). And if you don't know what to do in this kind of games, don't be ashamed to play a big endgame move (R18).

Ko has proven to be a very complex stuff as usual, you could see how it turned the game around two times. Especially the one on the right should have been definitely a profit for you, but in the end black managed to come back to the game there. 

Very cool to beat a European Women Champion from 2017!])
