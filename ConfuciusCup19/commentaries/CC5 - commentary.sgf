Especially after playing a 5d, facing a 2k afterwards is not so easy.]

seriously, it's a very slow move, which expands a territory of a living solid group and also doesn't put much pressure on your stones]

Your opponent played some of very unusual moves, but I think you did well how to play against them. You did just some small mistakes, like not playing atari at T6, however still you managed to get that group under attack (also thanks to another mistake at R14 ^^), which was the decisive moment for this game.
