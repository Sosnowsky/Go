Probably you missed T2 killing move?
Even if there was a ko, you should protect, because you would like to attack white's stones on the right

It's clear he is already a very mature player, he didn't make any obvious mistake. 

This was probably the first time when your push and cut variation in the bottom right corner completely backfired. The game became hard for you already after white escaped with J3 hane and even more difficult, when there was still T2 to kill your group. After that it was already very difficult to come back. ])
