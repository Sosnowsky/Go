PW[Marc Stoehr (2024)]PB[Sosnovsky (2131)]DT[2019-09-28]C[I played Marc a few times in the past. I am very disapointed with this game, I have the very bad habit of underesimating my opponents. I think I can get away in any fight and easily outread them. I was already aware of this since I already had this kind of game in the past, but somehow I still continue underestimating them...

It's not so easy to play weaker opponents, I can understand that, but to become a high-dan player, you have to get used to it, so let's take a look, what went wrong here

PS: my strategy is usually that I just play normal and wait for their mistake, but since you are a fighting player it probably would not suit you, but if you have a chance to clearly outread them -> do it]

The main points of this game: The fight in the bottom right went very well for you, so it was not necessary to cut at M10, which allowed white to cut at K8 later. In such situations, when keeping the play simple is obvious (hane at K10), you don't have to always resist, especially when the game is going well.

However, I really like your fighting spirit, how you were trying to come back from a hopeless position, which nearly happened to be successful.])
